    "content": "4 min read Mangrove forests burst with life, thriving in the muddy and saline environment of tropical coasts. While they cover a small portion of land area (geographically), they are giants in Earth’s carbon cycle. Mangroves are among the planet’s best carbon scrubbers, moving far more than their fair share of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into long-term storage. Thriving in brackish water that kills other plants, mangroves drop tons of leaves and branches—more than 9 metric tons per hectare (4 tons per acre) per year. The litter decomposes very slowly because the forests flood regularly at high tide. This translates into a lot of carbon taken out of the atmosphere and stored as peat in mangrove soils. These useful trees are being squeezed between rising seas and coastal development around the world, and scientists are working to assess what that means to the carbon cycle. For that, they need information on forest canopies; the taller the trees, the more carbon they remove from the atmosphere. But mangrove species are wildly divergent in height, with the same forest harboring trees as tall as giant sequoias and as short as rose bushes. And the forests are widely dispersed throughout the world’s tropics and subtropics, so a ground-level inventory is not possible. “It is a very muddy world,” said Marc Simard of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “You are in mud up to the knees. It’s extremely hot. Typically, there are a lot of mosquitoes, spiders, and bugs you don’t want.” Simard led a team of NASA and university researchers who recently measured mangrove canopy heights from space and estimated how much carbon is stored in these canopies. They calculated that the global above-ground mangrove carbon stock is 5.03 Petagrams (5.03 gigatons). That is within the range of published estimates, but considerably lower than recent estimates based on models. The map below, based on data from Simard and colleagues, depict the canopy height—the average height of the trees—around the Gabon Estuary in Africa. The muddy, fertile swamps of Gabon nurture the world’s tallest mangroves, with the loftiest tree (65 meters, or 213 feet) overtopping the Grizzly Giant sequoia of Yosemite National Park. And while the trees may not stand quite as tall, they are quite abundant in Indonesia. Nearly a quarter of the carbon stored globally in mangroves can be found in Indonesia. They also found that these productive forests—located in the some of the world’s wettest, cloudiest, and most remote regions—are significantly taller than previously reported. Equatorial West Africa and South America are hot spots for giant mangroves, with forests that match the height of tropical rainforests. Simard and colleagues also charted the relationship of tree height to rainfall, temperature, and the frequency of cyclones in each forested area. Globally, these three factors explain 74 percent of the differences in mangrove height. The other quarter depends on local factors, mostly the availability of nutrients and how salty the local swamp is. “The trees can cope with salt water, but they don't necessarily like it,” said Simard, who has done fieldwork in mangrove forests in Gabon. “The less saline it is, the less stressful it is for their productivity.” The researchers used global digital elevation maps from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and lidar altimetry measurements from NASA’s IceSat satellite to produce the new maps. They are a snapshot view, covering only a single year, but can serve as a baseline for nations or international organizations trying to monitor how climate is affecting these valuable ecosystems.

    "content": "8 min read Across NASA’s many missions, thousands of scientists, engineers, and other experts and professionals all over the country are doing what they do best, but now from home offices and via video conferencing. With most personnel supporting missions remotely to keep onsite staff at a minimal level in response to COVID-19, the agency is moving ahead strongly with everything from space exploration to using our technology and innovation to help inform policy makers. NASA is studying whether there are long-term responses from our planet caused by changes in human activity patterns due to COVID-19 quarantines. In the short-term, our satellites provide objective, accurate, and timely information on national and global food supplies that will help support USDA, USAID, and the global agencies that oversee food security. Scientists can track air quality changes, such as the drop in nitrogen dioxide, a major air pollutant, over major metropolitan areas around the world. Seeing Earth’s lights at night also helps researchers track patterns in energy use and human activity around the planet. Responding to the White House’s call to action to develop new technology and data mining approaches that could help the research community address COVID-19 science questions, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California used artificial intelligence and natural language technologies to extract medical diagnoses, medical conditions, and drug and disease information from a database of 25,000+ publications. The information helps shed light on transmission, incubation, and environmental stability of the virus; what has been published about medical care for those affected; what we know about COVID-19 risk factors; and what we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions. The data was made available to the research community on March 23. NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, will use its supercomputer to crunch extremely complex and high volumes of data to help with COVID-19. The center's supercomputers are part of the White House's COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium to provide COVID-19 researchers with access to the world’s most powerful high-performance computing resources that can significantly advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. The sophisticated computing can process massive numbers of calculations related to bioinformatics, epidemiology and molecular modeling, helping scientists develop answers to complex scientific questions about COVID-19 in hours or days versus weeks or months. To aid in the COVID-19 response, NASA is opening access to the full portion of its supercomputing resources reserved for national priorities outside of the agency’s aeronautics and space research and exploration scope. This includes storage and providing support to help researchers to port their applications to NASA computing systems, run their applications, troubleshoot any issues and address any other requested support, including visualization. NASA is exploring additional ways to leverage its expertise and capabilities to help with the national COVID-19 response. Employees can submit ideas for solutions relevant to COVID-19 via an internal crowdsourcing website. The call for ideas focuses on urgent needs related to personal protective equipment, ventilation devices, and monitoring and forecasting the spread and impacts of the virus, but any idea is welcome. Multiple ideas may be selected for follow-up and potential action. While we leverage our technical expertise and technology to help provide important COVID-19 information, we continue our exploration of the solar system and beyond. The interagency Community Coordinated Modeling Center continues to support and protect NASA robotic missions by monitoring space weather. We’re also monitoring the Sun 24 hours a day, seven days a week with our missions like the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. We’re also keeping an eye on asteroids, detecting and characterizing near-earth objects zooming by. For asteroids much farther out, OSIRIS-REx is gearing up for its close approach of Bennu on April 14, using Natural Feature Tracking (NFT) optical navigation flying to a range of about 125 meters from the surface, followed by the final low-altitude (about 250 meter) reconnaissance flyover of the backup Osprey sample site on May 26. Recently, the Mars Curiosity science team conducted its first “drilling while teleworking” activity. The team, while working remotely, controlled the rover in digging a hole in “Edinburgh,” a target on the top of the Greenheugh Pediment to learn more about the capping material that was a layer covering a large portion of Gail crater but now only remains in a few places. Juno’s next close flyby of Jupiter is slated for April 10 with the spacecraft at a specially designed attitude to increase particle measurements over the planet’s aurora. During this close flyby, known as PJ-26, or Perijove-26, scientists hope they will get measurements to help answer key questions about how Jupiter's aurora work and compare with Earth's aurora. With Hubble reaching its 30th year in space on April 24, the team is about to kick off the annual peer review of science proposals competing for Hubble observing time in the coming year. While the review usually involves astronomers all over the world gathering at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, this review will be held via videoconference. NASA’s other operating Great Observatory, Chandra, continues to study objects across the universe. In the last few weeks, the observatory has collected X-ray data on Supernova",

ENSO is an irregular cycle of warm and cold climate events called El Niño and La Niña. In normal years, strong easterly trade winds blow from the Americas toward southeast Asia, but in an El Niño year, those winds are reduced and sometimes even reversed. Warm water that was “piled up” in the western Pacific flows back toward the Americas, changing atmospheric pressure and moisture to produce droughts in Asia and more frequent storms and floods in the Americas. The reverse pattern is called a La Niña, in which the ocean in the eastern Pacific is cooler than normal.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Hurricane Michael plowed into the Florida panhandle Wednesday, Oct. 10, as a major Category 4 storm -- the strongest hurricane ever to hit that region. Many NASA instruments are keeping tabs on Michael from space, including the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). The first image, taken by AIRS, shows Hurricane Michael just off the west coast of Florida on Oct. 10 in the early morning hours local time. The large purple area indicates very cold clouds at about -90°F (-68°C) carried high into the atmosphere by deep thunderstorms. These storm clouds are associated with heavy rainfall. The eye, which is much warmer than the surrounding clouds, appears in green. The red areas moving away from the storm indicate temperatures of around 60°F (15°C), typical of the surface of Earth at night. These red areas are mostly cloud-free. MISR carries nine cameras fixed at different angles, each of which viewed Michael over the course of approximately seven minutes when it was just off Florida's west coast on Tuesday, Oct. 9. Images from the nine views are used to calculate the height of the cloud tops, and the motion of the clouds between the views provides information on wind speed and direction. This first MISR image shows the view from the central, downward-pointing camera (left), the calculated cloud-top heights (middle) and wind velocity arrows (right) superimposed on top. The length of the arrows is proportional to wind speed, and the colors show the altitude of the cloud tops in kilometers. MISR's stereo anaglyph shows a three-dimensional view of Michael that combines two of MISR's camera angles. Using 3D red-blue glasses, you can see a number of bright \"clumps.\" These clumps, called \"vortical hot towers,\" are groups of strong thunderstorms embedded in the larger circulation of the hurricane. They indicate the rapid transport of heat energy from the ocean surface into the storm and usually occur when a hurricane intensifies quickly. The National Hurricane Center clocked Michael's sustained wind speed at 150 mph (240 kph) just before noon local time on Wednesday, Oct. 10. It is expected to bring strong winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall to much of the southeast. AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface, even in the presence of heavy clouds. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations, and many other atmospheric phenomena.

    "content": "6 min read By Pat Brennan,NASA's Sea Level Change Portal The movement of continents is far slower than a snail’s pace. It’s more like watching your fingernails grow. But speed up the movie over tens of millions of years and it begins to look like a demolition derby. Riding over Earth’s mantle on strong but flexible plates, the continents smash together and tear themselves apart, creating rugged mountain chains or deep ocean trenches. Hot magma from below the crust can rise toward the surface, like a blister pushing up below the skin. These gas and liquid-rich rocks create volcanoes. And they are created by hot spots – buoyant material that rises from more than 400 miles (660 kilometers) down, or even as deep as the core-mantle boundary. The ocean crust and continental plates glide over these hot spots through time, leaving scars over millions of years that reveal the plates’ paths. New seismic data and analysis, along with mechanical modeling capabilities, are allowing scientists to get to know these previously cryptic features a little better. And they are turning out to be potentially important when it comes to predicting how quickly the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica will flow into the sea, reducing ice mass in the polar regions and raising sea levels. The heat welling up from Earth’s interior beneath ice sheets and glaciers has nothing to do with the relatively rapid change in climate over recent decades, driven mainly by human emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the atmosphere. Heat sources from the deep Earth can remain steady for 50, 90 or 100 million years; human-driven climate change is occurring over mere decades and centuries. But as the coastal ice shelves that hold back glaciers begin to thin and melt away, the glaciers – essentially rivers of ice – are suddenly free to flow more quickly. If their channels happen to carry them over hot spots in the mantle, they can flow all the faster. “Heat content within an ice sheet raises the temperature, and therefore lowers viscosity” of the ice at the base of the glacier, said Erik Ivins, a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The result: lubrication of the glacier’s movement. “It’s capable of expelling ice mass through faster flow,” Ivins said. A dramatic example is found in Greenland, where a long “thermal track” was recently revealed beneath the miles-thick ice sheet that covers the giant island. This scar tells an 80-million-year story. As the North American continental plate carried Greenland north, it glided over a relatively stationary hot spot – the same spot that later formed Iceland after Greenland had moved on, leaving the hot spot to punch out a new land mass from the crust beneath the sea. The scar’s track through Greenland still shows a measurable heat signature, according to a study published in August",

Well, last summer was so hot, salmon were literally cooking themselves in the rivers. Bad joke? Perhaps. While you won’t find river-boiled salmon on the menu at your local seafood restaurant anytime soon, it’s a fact that last July, as Alaska and much of the Arctic experienced near-record warmth, the water temperature in some Alaskan rivers reached an unfathomable 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius). The abnormally warm waters led to mass salmon die-offs. Sadly, the fate of the simmering salmon, while exaggerated, stems from a disturbing reality.

Each dairy cow annually emits between 80 and 120 kg of methane (incidentally, mainly through burping and not farting) — which is equivalent to the carbon emissions given off by an average family car over a year. As if eating chocolate wasn’t guilt-inducing enough for some already. So, the company is teaching its farmers to put their cows on a diet and has recently come out with a guide to low carbon farming. By modifying their diets, the hope is to reduce the amount of methane that is produced by micro-organisms in the cows’ stomachs. Of course, it's not all about methane, which makes up only about a quarter of the average dairy farm's emissions.

Seasonal cues, such as warmer spring temperatures or cooler temperatures in the fall, tell animals when to migrate, when to mate, and when and where to find food. Predators and prey, birds and mammals alike follow this natural schedule, and an overall shift of just a few days or weeks could have unknown impacts on these animals and ecosystems. These changes in seasonal timing are already starting – although the shifts differ between species and populations – according to a new study published Nov. 5 in Science that was funded in part by the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE). The researchers analyzed data from the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA), a collection of data from more than 200 research studies tracking nearly a hundred species from",

Using NASA satellite data, the researchers got a bird’s-eye view of how noise and light negatively affected bird reproduction in North America. The team also discovered that these factors might interact with or even mask birds’ responses to the effects of climate change. Bird populations have declined by about 30 percent in the last few decades. Scientists and land managers seeking to understand what caused the decline and reverse the trend had largely overlooked the effects of noise and light pollution, until recent studies suggested that these stressors could harm certain types of birds.

    "content": "Today is Blog Action Day, which aims to bring about the \"largest-ever social change event on the web\". Over 10,000 bloggers in 150 countries are joining together to write about climate change today. Since we write about climate change all the time here on my big fat planet, I thought we’d take a look at some highlights from elsewhere in the blogosphere so far… Nettuts+ wrote about the top 20 ways web developers can reduce their carbon footprint. While the topic might not sound thrilling, here are a few interesting tidbits: Use an eco-friendly font. Yes, an eco-friendly font actually exists. It saves on average 20 percent more ink than other fonts, by craftily removing parts of the letter you would never notice anyway. Don’t use a screensaver. They still use power, and actually keep your computer from going into full power-save mode. Add a plant or two to your office (they give out oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide). A New Delhi company found that by adding three different types of plants to their offices they reduced eye irritation, headaches, lung issues, and respiratory system incidents over the course of 15 years. They also cut their energy bill by 15 percent. The Tcktcktck campaign has released a new video in honor of Blog Action Day, urging world leaders to make the right promises at “the most important meeting in the history of the world”. They’re referring of course to this December’s U.N climate treaty talks in Copenhagen, and the video is part of their efforts to help make a “fair, ambitious and binding” deal happen. Google gave blog readers a green tour of their campus today. In it we learned that the company actually rents goats to mow the fields of their Mountain View headquarters in California. Jen the border collie helps to herd them. No kidding. TUAW, the unofficial Apple blog, advertized five apps to help save the world. They include “Pollution”, which pinpoints local pollutant sources in your area on an interactive map. And “Gas Cubby”, which helps you track your car’s miles per gallon, vehicle maintenance and sends reminders for things you can do to keep your car running more efficiently and burn less fossil fuels. Fix the climate, or the kid gets it. In this entry, Mother Jones writes about what it’s going to take to get action on climate change. “You know the answer — we all do: It's going to take popular pressure, aka politicians feeling that they have to produce something on this issue to get reelected. And that, in turn, takes convincing Americans that something we care about is actually at risk here…And of course [that] something is…our kids.“ Speaking of politicians, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown blogged just after midnight on a similar theme: “Like every parent, I want to leave a safe and secure world for my children. And I want to be able to look them in the eye because our generation stood up for their future.” Brown says he will attend the December talks \"if it means we will get an agreement, and I am urging other leaders to join me. But it must be the start of something not the end.\" Let’s see what Copenhagen brings. This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "From Mike Carlowicz, NASA's Earth Science News Team Oceanographer Josh Willis of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was recently honored by the White House as a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). Willis studies the ocean — particularly the height of the sea surface — with satellite data, though he also works with colleagues who put instruments below the surface of the water. By blending such measurements, he has already made a scientific mark in the study of sea level rise. We caught up with Josh — shown above with White House science advisor John Holdren and NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver — to discuss his inspiration, the importance of the ocean, and the necessity of communicating science. When you were a child, what did you want to be when you grew up? When did you decide you wanted to be an ocean scientist? When I was 9 or 10, I found a book about Einstein's Theory of Relativity that my parents had lying around the house. I remember reading it and then peppering my parents with questions they couldn't answer. (This was long before Google, mind you.) So for a long time, I wanted to be a physicist. A couple years of graduate school in physics convinced me otherwise, and I started studying oceanography at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Studying the ocean and climate appealed to me because I got to use all the physics and math I learned, but it was also closer to home and of practical importance to a lot of people. Plus, it's just fun to say \"oceanographer\" whenever people ask me what I do. What is the best scientific paper you have written? It's tough to say. Sometimes the papers I think are important are different from the ones that other scientists remember best. But my papers on the causes of sea level rise — based on comparisons between satellite altimeter data, observations of ocean temperature changes, and changes in ocean mass measured by the GRACE satellite — were interesting and fun to write. What is the most important thing that few people know about the ocean? The ocean is the silent martyr of global warming. We always think of global climate change in terms of the warming atmosphere, but it is actually the ocean that absorbs almost all of the extra heat and a whole lot of carbon dioxide [CO2]. The warming contributes to sea level rise and changes ocean ecosystems, while the extra CO2 makes the ocean more acidic, threatening plankton and other tiny critters that make up the foundation of the oceanic food chain. Why do you feel compelled to talk to the public about your science? Communicating our work is a really important part of doing science that most scientists sort of neglect. Figuring out new things about the world around us is only helpful if we communicate them to everyday people. Plus it's fun and exciting to talk to non-scientists because the questions are often interesting, and I come away feeling inspired and invigorated. What is the funniest or strangest question you've ever gotten? I often get a chuckle out of the people who say that global warming is a vast conspiracy among scientists. Scientists love to prove each other wrong, and most of the time we can barely agree on simple questions like \"Why is the sky blue?\" much less orchestrate a conspiracy. Is the PECASE award an affirmation or an inspiration for your career? This is definitely a great honor and inspiration. When President Obama met us, one of the first things he told us was how nice it was to honor a group of scientists still in the early stages of our careers. \"All of you folks are younger than me!\" he said. But he also made it clear that he expected a lot from us in the future. That's a pretty big inspiration when the President tells you he's expecting great things. And it's a pretty big responsibility, too. I guess that means it's probably time to get back to work now... Cross posted from NASA’s What on Earth blog.

    "content": "11 min read By Aries Keck,NASA's Earth Science Division Earth is a pale blue dot when seen from space. Its blue color is due to our home planet being 71% covered in water. NASA monitors Earth's water from space, the skies, ground stations on land, ships sailing the seas and even with apps on mobile phones. While Earth is so wet that it looks blue from space, most of that water is saltwater. Only 2.5% of water on Earth is fresh water, and nearly all of that water is frozen—locked up in polar ice caps, glaciers and other ice. The small amount of fresh water that remains is all that's available for all the ways we use water. \"All the water on Earth already exists. We can't make more,\" said Bradley Doorn, program manager for NASA Earth Applied Sciences' Water Resources program area. \"We can only track it, predict it and protect it as it cycles around our world.\" NASA tracks nearly every aspect of this water cycle—as precipitation falls from clouds; as groundwater; as water soaks into soil; as it moves into rivers and lakes; as it is taken up by plants, used by animals and evaporates back into the atmosphere. \"Water is a precious resource on this planet, and one that NASA is at the cutting edge of monitoring,\" said Doorn. The cyclical nature of fresh water moving around our world has led to the overarching science question that NASA is trying to answer about water on our world—where it is, when it is and in what condition. To a finer and finer degree, NASA research scientists are determining how much and when fresh water is available worldwide. As these core science questions are being asked and answered, NASA is also looking toward developing and strengthening new and innovative ways data are used to track both the use and quality of the world's fresh water. In addition, as the world warms due to climate change, NASA scientists are investigating how the world's water cycle is affected by and has effects on Earth's climate. NASA’s Earth Science Division studies fresh water using data collected in many ways, including satellites, airborne missions and even information collected by volunteers. NASA scientists study water in nearly all of its aspects on Earth: as precipitation, ice and snow, in groundwater reserves and in lakes and rivers, just to name a few. A few examples of the research focus NASA scientists take to studying water include ways to track water quality, determining water availability and predicting drought, measuring irrigation and water use for agriculture, and world-wide precipitation. The amount of precipitation falling on Earth at any given time varies greatly from place to place, so having a satellite-level view provides more uniform observations around the globe because it includes data over the world's oceans and is more complete than most on-the-ground measurements.

    "content": "8 min read By Tovar Cerulli and Amber Jenkins,NASA’s Western Water Applications Office The horses came from miles around. Seeking life, they found death. Last spring, the arid western edge of the Navajo Nation in Arizona was drier than it had been in many years. Feral and wild horses, dehydrated and malnourished, sought out a watering hole near Gray Mountain. Instead of finding relief, nearly 200 got stuck in muddy clay and perished. It’s a scene that comes to mind for Carlee McClellan when he thinks about drought. On the Navajo Nation, access to drinking water is limited, more than 40 percent of homes lack running water, and many people haul water over 50 miles by truck to replenish their storage cisterns. But if we want to understand what water, rain and drought mean there, we need to think beyond household use. Drought has a huge impact on agriculture, threatening the survival of plants and animals alike. McClellan grew up on the reservation with his grandmother, practicing traditional dry farming, which relies on rainfall instead of irrigation and involves a variety of techniques for conserving scarce moisture. So he knows how reliant his people are on crops and livestock like horses, cows and sheep. “Crops and livestock are an integral part of Navajo life,” said McClellan. “Water is important on many different levels beyond what you have coming into your home.” Those many levels explain why McClellan, senior hydrologist for the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources, is committed to developing the Drought Severity Evaluation Tool. The tool – a collaboration between NASA’s Western Water Applications Office (WWAO), the Navajo Nation and the Desert Research Institute – is geared to helping the Navajo improve its ability to monitor and report drought. It combines precipitation data from NASA satellites, drought indices and on-the-ground rain measurements within a user-friendly web application. Managing the water resources of the Navajo Nation is particularly difficult. With a population of over 200,000, it is the largest federally-recognized sovereign tribe in the U.S. in land area, located in the four corners region of the southwestern U.S. The Nation experiences frequent and pervasive droughts, with very variable precipitation patterns amid a backdrop of consistently rising temperatures.

    "content": "4 min read By Aries Keck,NASA's Earth Science Division NASA's long-term, global view of Earth from space includes data on sunlight, wind, temperature and precipitation, all key elements in understanding how our planet works. That same information is also being put to very practical use on Earth by improving the energy efficiency of buildings and siting renewable energy technology like wind turbines and solar panels. NASA's Prediction of the Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project puts NASA data into the hands of sustainability specialists for decision making. \"School districts, private companies, all types of people use it all over the world,\" said Paul Stackhouse, the project manager for POWER. Based at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and supported by NASA’s Earth Science Division in Washington, one example of POWER is its work with Hawaii school district to monitor energy use in all public school buildings in the state. \"We're able to provide details on their energy usage and their energy efficiency,\" said Stackhouse. \"It also provides estimates of greenhouse gas emissions.\" The program does this by incorporating NASA satellite data into an desktop software program called RETScreen Expert. RETScreen is a clean energy management software program developed by the Canadian government in collaboration with several international partners, including NASA. \"It's an engineering and financial analysis tool that professionals use to apply the data, with most of the resource data products coming from us,\" Stackhouse said. One application of that data was by the Pennsylvania school district of Palmyra. When they uploaded two years of energy bills into the RETScreen, they were able to confirm that the energy use from those buildings correlated with NASA's long-term Earth science data. That information then let them predict possible values of energy savings they would receive by making their buildings more sustainable. Most of the environmental parameters (like temperature, humidity and winds) that Stackhouse's team includes into the RETScreen project is developed by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). Based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., its computer model and data assimilation techniques enhance NASA Earth observations from more than 20 NASA satellites and missions. However, the key data parameter, solar irradiance, comes from a combination of NASA’s Surface Radiation Budget and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) FLASHFlux data products.

A new animation from NASA software engineers, based on finely tuned computer models, reveals how massive ice sheets that once sprawled across Canada, Greenland and Antarctica thickened and thinned over time. Their rise and fall keep time with the last great ice age. And they reveal a pattern that continues today: The land surface is still rebounding from the heavy weight of those long-vanished glaciers. This postglacial rebound – known as glacial isostatic adjustment, or GIA – is a critical factor in estimating sea-level rise over time. Of most concern to humanity are sea levels measured at the shoreline, or relative sea level. But to know how much of that rise is caused by a warming world, scientists must make comparisons with other sea-level drivers. Land areas along the coast can subside, for instance, raising relative sea levels. And rebounding land rises, pushing these sea levels lower. So high-precision ice-modeling allows not only a replay of the past, but a more accurate understanding of the present: It helps scientists interpret data from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites, which measure bumps and dips in gravity as they pass over land and water. These correspond to differences in the “weight,” or mass, of features on or near the surface. Think large water bodies. Think glaciers. “GRACE estimates of ice loss over the past 15 years depend strongly on the post-glacial rebound model,” said Donald F. Argus, co-author on recent papers detailing the latest GIA modeling effort – called the “ICE-6G_D” model. Without a clear understanding of postglacial rebound, scientists could potentially underestimate rates of sea-level rise caused by melting ice and warming, expanding ocean water. That could throw off estimates of future sea-level rise as well. The new model was developed by Richard Peltier and Rosemarie Drummond of the University of Toronto and by Argus, a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. They made a number of improvements over past versions. The new model fully accounts for the loss of “grounded” ice – ice anchored to land – in Antarctica’s Ross and Weddell seas, Peltier said. The difference between the two is critical to sea-level estimates. Melting of grounded ice contributes to sea-level rise, while floating ice does not (it’s why the melting of ice cubes doesn’t cause your ice-water glass to runneth over). The improved model also scores a few “firsts” – among them, capturing the multiple domes of the gigantic ice sheet that covered so much of North America during the most recent ice age. GIA data from the twin GRACE satellites, and their successors, GRACE Follow-on, helped test the idea of one big dome over the Laurentide ice sheet – that vast expanse of now-vanished ice. “Previous versions of the model were characterized as having a more mono-domal ice sheet over Canada,” Peltier wrote in an email. “But this possibility has been firmly ruled out by the GRACE observations.” And the new model also is the first to match up with multiple observation records: readings from GPS sensors on land movement, high-precision remote sensing of surface changes and ice loss, and the tracking of sea-level rise by satellite. These various measurements cover North America, Europe and Antarctica as well as oceans. Experts at JPL converted the complex new model into a simpler animation, showing the waxing of ice sheets, depressing the land surface, and their waning into the present day, allowing the land to spring back gradually over thousands of years.

    "content": "By Patrick Lynch, NASA Earth Science News Team NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt, from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, has become one of the oft-heard voices in the public discussion about climate change. With colleagues, he launched the blog RealClimate about six years ago. Its focus on the facts — and confronting the spin — about climate science have made it an online draw. But, Schmidt wouldn't mind seeing more scientists follow the RealClimate lead. He sat on a panel about communicating climate recently at the Washington, D.C., annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and afterward sat down to discuss the ins and outs of talking about climate change. 1. You've been doing RealClimate for six years. Has it made a difference? I think so. At the time we started there were no climate scientists who were blogging or interacting with the public in any significant way. And now there are a lot more. We set the stage for a lot of people — though not to the extent that we anticipated. One of the things that I think happens is people see, \"Oh, climate scientists we know are blogging. We're glad someone's doing it, and now I don't need to worry about it.\" And I worry about that a little bit. When there are only a few voices, those voices become imbued with more importance than they would otherwise merit. 2. Why do you say it's important to bring more diversity of scientific voices to the public debate? I can have disagreements with another colleague. We may know all the same stuff, and he or she just thinks something is more important than I do. That's not any kind of problem. That's how science progresses. When you've just got a Carl Sagan, and he's our spokesperson for all astrophysical things, it makes it seems as if Carl Sagan knows everything or he's always right. Any individual scientist is imperfect. And any individual person is not the perfect spokesperson. When you have \"spokespeople,\" it's really easy for people who have agendas and people who have axes to grind to spend all their time now focusing on the \"spokesperson's\" imperfections. All of which is a clear digression from what you're trying to focus on — which is science. If your critique of science is that scientists are not perfect human beings, then it's no critique at all. 3. Some of the talk on the [AAAS meeting] panel was that scientists need to step out of the scientific framework to communicate with the public, perhaps more like a politician would. I saw you shaking your head at that a bit. Why? The rules are different if you're going to advocate for a course of action. But what's happened over the last 10 or 15 years is not that a tremendous amount of scientists have all of a sudden decided to become political advocates. Instead, we've had hard-working scientists get yanked by the scruff of their necks into the political arena and get thrown to the wolves. That's a completely different kettle of fish. Ben Santer is one, Mike Mann is another, and Heidi Cullen another. They did not choose to become political actors and yet these things happened. I don't talk about policy preferences very much. But I can tell you what might happen if you're going to do something that's going to change the atmospheric composition. That's a very different role. 4. Do you pay attention to what the social science says about how people digest news and science? Some very valid insights have come from social science research. People don’t look at all the [climate] science and then come up with an opinion. Most of the time they come up with an opinion then find things to support that opinion. People will ask you, \"Isn't all the carbon dioxide coming from volcanoes?\" Well, it's not that they did independent research on volcanic activity and carbon dioxide emissions. They read it from one of their trusted sources. Why do they trust that source over other ones? Those are interesting questions. And in asking those questions you can often find out what is really bothering them. 5. What do you see as the role of a government agency like NASA? There are two roles. One is to facilitate access to agency results, to put agency results in a wider context, and allowing access to agency data, and NASA does that really well. And the second role is allowing scientists to speak, and NASA does pretty well with that, too. Historically we've had some issues. But right now NASA is very aware. It employs scientists to do work because it trusts those scientists to do their work. Part and parcel of that is trusting them to not say stupid things when they speak in public. You have to be able to trust them to talk about the science they're doing.

    "content": "5 min read Interview by Gretchen Cook-Anderson,NASA Earth Science News Team Permafrost is not your garden-variety soil. Beneath the frozen depths of the Arctic, the icy soil stores an estimated 1.5 trillion tons of carbon - methane and other hydrocarbons - twice as much as is found in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are locked up in permafrost, frozen ground that covers 24 percent of exposed land in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, as well as parts of Antarctica and the Patagonian region of Argentina and Chile in the Southern Hemisphere. Greenhouse gases are escaping the permafrost and entering the atmosphere at an increasing rate - up to 50 billion tons each year of methane, for example - due to a global thawing trend. This is particularly troublesome because methane heats the atmosphere with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide. The release of all this stored carbon could change climate in the Arctic in ways researchers have yet to fully understand. Researchers, such as Larry Hinzman of the University of Alaska, are digging deeper to find out more. Permafrost is soil, rock, or peat that has been frozen below zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) continuously for two or more years. This means it's not defined by geology or region. It can exist in high mountain areas such as the Rocky Mountains and Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro, in peak elevations in, say, North and South Dakota, and even in rare spots on the Hawaiian islands. Permafrost is like frozen chicken in that it thaws but it does not melt (in contrast to ice, which melts). Following a childhood in rural South Dakota, I pursued a degree in agronomy. Agronomy explores the impact of agriculture on the environment and melds the biology, chemistry and earth science associated with soil with meteorology and plant growth. After completing that master's degree, I came to Alaska on a vacation. I loved it so much up here that I got a job working for a gold prospector, but nearly starved that winter without finding much gold. A friend recommended a job at the university in Fairbanks as an agricultural field technician, which was more aligned with my education. Despite fighting off attacks to our experiments from buffalo and sand hill cranes, I enjoyed the work and decided to pursue a doctorate in soil physics. I leapt from agronomy to hydrology, but the two are linked. So much of the study of water in agriculture involves understanding how permafrost controls moisture in Alaskan soils, and therefore whether some crops grow and others don't when permafrost is present. In Alaska, we're living right on the knife's edge between frozen and thawed landscape. That's a huge difference between the lower 48 states and us. Temperature changes here affect the structural stability of entire ecosystems much more than in a more temperate state such as Arkansas. If permafrost changes -if it degrades even a foot - it will act like a big domino that knocks everything else over. When the sun's rays hit frozen soil, the soil moisture evaporates, making the surface cooler. Without permafrost, drier soil causes surface warming, and this changes the local climate. Thawing permafrost also releases methane into the atmosphere in amounts potentially far greater than human emissions. Permafrost below the Arctic Ocean has trapped huge quantities of methane (called gas hydrates), and as the permafrost degrades, the amount of methane escaping the frozen ground increases, with implications for climate change. Permafrost is very hard to see. But we can trace changes in surface conditions that sometimes occur when permafrost thaws with a technique called interferometry, which uses electromagnetic waves to point us to places where surface subsidence has occurred. Interferometry allows us to detect massive surface disturbances called \"thermokarsts,\" which are produced as permafrost thaws and ice wedges contained in it melt. We also use NASA's gravity-detecting GRACE satellites, which help us trace changes in groundwater reservoirs that may indicate thawing permafrost. We have an ongoing satellite project with NASA to look at Russian permafrost. Russia is experiencing rapid degradation of permafrost, and we want to learn more about how that thawing is affecting the levels of lakes and rivers and the amount of meltwater - released from melted snow or ice - pouring into the ocean. The Russians have been collecting runoff data for a century. Those data are telling us that runoff is increasing in the winter, but we're trying to figure out why. We believe that thawing permafrost plays a role in controlling infiltration of rain and snowmelt, which affects the timing of eventual runoff into rivers and to the ocean. We know for sure that the increased runoff is contributing to a freshening of the waters of the Arctic Ocean; lower-density freshwater tends to float on the saltier ocean water. Increases in freshwater near the Earth's poles could affect the circulation in the oceans, which influences everything from atmospheric temperatures to storm intensity.

Credit: NASA Goddard/Desiree Stover By Kathryn Cawdrey, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center A new NASA laser instrument set to launch to the International Space Station in December will help scientists create the first three-dimensional map of the world’s temperate and tropical forests. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, or GEDI, is scheduled to launch on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. From the station, GEDI’s advanced laser technology will reveal the three-dimensional structure of forest ecosystems around the globe. GEDI pronounced “Jedi,” will soar over both the dark side and the light side of Earth at 17,150 miles per hour. Measurements of the height of foliage, branches, trees and shrubs below its path will yield new insights into how forests are storing or releasing carbon. “We’d like to be able to understand what the role of forests are,” said Principal Investigator Ralph Dubayah of the University of Maryland, College Park. “We want to know how much carbon is being stored in trees because if we cut those trees down, that’s a potential source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.” The GEDI mission is designed to help researchers locate those sources and stores of carbon. Scientists know how much carbon is going into the atmosphere, but are much less certain about where and in what quantities carbon is being absorbed, explained Laura Duncanson, a research assistant professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. Earth’s oceans and forests take up atmospheric carbon, but scientists want to investigate which forests are taking in the most, or if those forests will continue to do so through time. GEDI will help unravel this mystery by providing the first highly detailed forest carbon stock map, pinpointing in fine detail where the Earth’s most carbon-rich forests are. “To effectively manage forests toward mitigating climate change, we need to know how much carbon they store and how that’s distributed spatially, and that’s what GEDI will give us,” Duncanson said. “We can’t know how much carbon is released to the atmosphere through deforestation and forest degradation until we know how much is already there; GEDI will collect new data and fill this big, critical carbon knowledge gap.” GEDI’s lidar instrument sends laser pulses down to Earth, where they penetrate forests below the station’s orbit at temperate and tropical latitudes. The laser beams ricochet off the first thing they hit, which can be a leaf atop a dense canopy, a protruding branch, or the ground from which the forest emerges. The energy returned to the GEDI telescope on the International Space Station will provide an intricate three-dimensional map of forest canopies. “We can send out a little pulse of light and it travels down, reflects off the surface, and comes back,” Bryan Blair, GEDI instrument scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and deputy principal investigator, said. “We can see and measure how tall the tree is and we can actually see how dense are the foliage and branches as we go down.” When looking at anything, such as a building or a tree, what you see is light reflecting off the surface. The GEDI team is replicating that function using a laser, which is also made of light. However, GEDI is a very specific wavelength that allows scientists to filter out any other type of light, Blair explained. “We just provide our own light source,” he said. “It reflects off all the leaves, then the branches, and eventually the ground.” A comprehensive 3D map of canopy height and structure helps scientists determine the height and the mass of trees. A tall, broad tree will store more carbon than a short one. Trees, when dried, are composed of approximately 50 percent carbon, which would be released into the atmosphere if a tree was cut down and burned. Mature forests are vital to maintaining stored carbon within their trunks, but young, rapidly-growing trees generally take in atmospheric carbon at a much higher rate. “We want to measure how much carbon is in the forest, which is related to how tall the trees are, how big around they are, how many branches there are, how many leaves there are, and how big the roots are,” Blair said. GEDI floods a dense canopy with laser light pulses that bounce back after making contact with an object. The end result is a comprehensive view of the density all the way down to the ground, Blair explained. The biggest challenge is having enough laser power and sensitivity to see through tropical forests, which is something GEDI does well. The instrument can work well even in the world’s densest forests, where less than 1 percent of the light that shines down makes it all the way to the ground. In addition to forest structure, GEDI will measure patterns of different environments within tropical and temperate forests. Limited data from field plots and airborne and space-based lidar have given scientists an idea of how habitat structure varies at specific locations, but GEDI’s advanced technology will fill in the missing pieces of information around the Earth, said Scott Goetz, deputy principal investigator and professor at Northern Arizona University. “We’ll be able to inform models of biodiversity, including patterns of species richness and specific habitat requirements of threatened and endangered species.” Goetz said. “If we’re better able to map where those habitats are using GEDI canopy structure data combined with other satellite data, it will help with the conservation of those species and forests harboring high biodiversity.” GEDI is slated to begin its two-year science mission aboard the station by the end of",

These creatures are best known for producing prodigious amounts of honey, the sweet amber substance they create by digesting and regurgitating sugar-rich nectar found within the petals of flowering plants. Then there's the dancing: they perform a range of complex \"waggle\" dances to communicate. But they also happen to be the workhorse of our agricultural system, pollinating crops ranging from almonds to watermelons to peaches. In the U.S., for example, they contribute more than $14 billion to agriculture each year. Now — thanks to an innovative project conceived by Wayne Esaias, a NASA oceanographer and keen beekeeper — bees have yet another role: that of climate data collectors. When honey bees search for nectar, colony scouts tend to scour far and wide and sample the area around a hive remarkably evenly, regardless of the size of the hive. And that means they excel at keeping tabs on flowering ecosystems in ways that even a small army of scientists could not. The key information that bees collect relates to the nectar flow, which in the mid-Atlantic region tends to come in a burst in the spring. Major nectar flows, typically caused by blooms of tulip-poplar and black locust trees, leave an unmistakable fingerprint on beehives — a rapid increase in hive weight sometimes exceeding 20 lbs per day. When a nectar flow finishes, the opposite is true: hives start to lose weight, sometimes by as much as 1 lb a day. Esaias, who works at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, has been studying this cycle of beehive yo yo dieting in the U.S., as he explains in the video above.

    "date": null,
    "content": "By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Earth Science News Team Illustration of NASA's OCO-3 mounted on the underside of the International Space Station. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech › Full image and caption NASA is ready to launch a new space instrument that will use the vantage point of the International Space Station to monitor Earth's carbon cycle. A follow-on to the still-active OCO-2 mission, OCO-3 will bring not only a new vantage point but new techniques and new technologies to NASA's carbon dioxide observations. Why are we launching a new carbon observatory? Read on. NASA's OCO-3 mission is ready for launch to the International Space Station. This follow-on to OCO-2 brings new techniques and new technologies to carbon dioxide observations of Earth from space. Carbon dioxide (CO2) naturally cycles into and out of the air from plants and animals, the ocean, and land, with the cycle staying in balance over the long term. CO2 added into the atmosphere by human activities over the last 250 years has increased the amount of the gas that stays in the atmosphere. This extra gas traps heat through the greenhouse effect, resulting in a warming of the climate. NASA and other scientific institutions keep a close eye on this and other atmospheric changes and the ways Earth is responding to them, continually seeking to improve our observations. OCO-3 is the latest addition to the global space-based fleet observing this critical greenhouse gas. OCO-3 was built by adapting a duplicate version of OCO-2, originally built as a \"flight spare\" - an exact copy that a mission builds in case there's a problem with the original instrument. Thus OCO-3 will extend and enhance a data set that has already proven its value. The space station circles Earth between 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south latitudes - about the latitudes of London and Patagonia. The vast majority of Earth's cities and agricultural lands, responsible for most of our planet's carbon absorption and emissions, fall within this zone. Where OCO-2's polar orbit takes it over each location at exactly the same time of day, the space station's orbit will put OCO-3 over each location at a slightly different time on every orbit. Mounted externally on the underside of the space station, OCO-3 will collect the first dawn-to-dusk observations of variations in carbon dioxidefrom space over tropical and mid-latitude regions, giving a better view of emission and absorption processes. For example, the vast carbon stores of the rapidly changing Amazon rainforest are a critical part of Earth's carbon cycle, but when OCO-2 flies over the forest at about 1:30 p.m., afternoon clouds have usually built up, hiding the region from the instrument's view. OCO-3 will pass the Amazon at all times of day, capturing far more cloud-free data. It's a spectrometer - in fact, three spectrometers sharing one telescope. Like radios tuned to different stations, the spectrometers are \"tuned\" to observe different sets of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Every atmospheric gas absorbs sunlight at a specific set of wavelengths, and carbon dioxide is no exception. Two of OCO-3's spectrometers record two sets of wavelengths where carbon dioxide absorption is strong; the third records wavelengths with strong absorption of oxygen, which researchers need in order to calculate the total number of molecules in the part of the atmosphere where the measurement was made. Combining the data from the three spectrometers allows researchers to obtain a measurement of CO2 so accurate that it records the difference between, for example, 405 and 406 molecules of the gas in every 1 million molecules of air. OCO-3 observes a very faint glow that plants emit during photosynthesis, called solar-induced fluorescence (SIF). This light is far too dim for humans to notice under normal circumstances, but it is the most accurate indicator of photosynthesis that can be measured from space. As Earth's climate changes, rainfall and temperature are changing plant growth around the globe in ways that may affect world food security. Understanding exactly when photosynthesis happens - how its seasonal startup and shutdown are changing in remote locations around the globe - can help us prepare for the challenges of the future. OCO-3's SIF measurement will have the same high resolution as OCO-2's, and the new instrument will add an ability to rapidly swivel and point its sensors at towers on the ground where SIF is monitored locally, collecting data on almost the same spatial scale as these towers so that its measurements can be validated. Because photosynthesis is an important part of the global carbon cycle, the SIF data complement OCO-3's carbon dioxide measurements. OCO-3 will demonstrate a new technique to measure urban carbon emissions, volcanic eruptions and other local carbon sources from space. The origins of carbon dioxide can be hard to discern by satellite because the gas mixes rapidly and uniformly into the air. For example, we know from global emissions data that more than 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities come from cities. OCO-2's orbit produces a long swath of measurements that slice through a few cities, but it is still a challenge to gather satellite data in enough detail to differentiate between a city's own output and CO2 that drifted into the city on air currents, which may have been released months ago on the other side of the globe. OCO-3's new feature is called \"snapshot mode.\" This scanning technique, enabled by the instrument's ability to swivel and point rapidly, produces a tightly woven blanket of measurements over an area of about 50 by 50 miles (80 by 80 kilometers) - about the size of the Los Angeles Basin.

Projects will assist communities in building resilience to complex stresses and making decisions that have long-term benefits for people and the environment. “This partnership enables NASA and Mercy Corps to amplify our collective capacities to reach communities in the most risk-prone regions of the world with the information they need the most,” said David Green, disasters program director in NASA’s Earth Science Division, Washington. “As NASA seeks to expand our understanding of the integrated Earth system from global to local scales, Mercy Corps’ extensive and practical knowledge of the human element – social, environmental, economic and political – is critical.” Through the partnership, Mercy Corps aims to integrate NASA’s data and tools into the organization’s analysis and program design processes, as well as make NASA’s data available to local decision makers. This would help national and municipal governments and local community groups better design and implement their own sustainable, data-driven policies and programs in response to the critical challenges they face. “NASA’s data and unparalleled expertise can help us better understand Earth’s resources in fragile areas where communities are increasingly vulnerable to existential threats like climate change and conflict,” said Eliot Levine, Mercy Corps director for energy, environment and climate. “Our response to these challenges must become more sophisticated, transcending typical development and humanitarian practices.” In an initial project in Niger (seen from orbit in",

I am here as part of the NASA component of the US delegation and my role is to represent NASA and inform the audience about how NASA satellites are a key component to studying and monitoring our changing planet. Since today was Sunday, most COP17 activities were on a break, but I did attend a side event called Forest Day 5. It is probably COP17’s largest side event and one of the most intense and influential annual global events on the state of the world’s forests. It’s an opportunity for stakeholders from different backgrounds and regions to share their experiences and debate the pressing issues that forests are facing worldwide. Now in its fifth year, Forest Day brings together world leaders, researchers, donors, policymakers, climate change negotiators, the media, non-government and intergovernmental organizations, indigenous people’s groups and other forest-dependent people. What do forests have to do with climate change? Well, as the UN explains, deforestation and forest degradation — through agricultural expansion, conversion to pastureland, infrastructure development, destructive logging and fires — account for nearly 20 percent of the world’s emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. This is more than the entire global transportation sector and second only to the energy sector. Constraining climate change to within “safe” levels, such as keeping the world’s temperature rise to within about two degrees Celsius, will therefore have to involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s forests. The main topic of discussion at Forest Day was the UN’s REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program, a collaborative effort between countries to reduce heat-trapping carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. One of the goals is to create a financial value for the carbon stored in forests, thus offering incentives for developing countries to conserve trees, sustainably manage forests and enhance forest carbon stocks. Talks focused on implementing a global business plan that not only reduces emissions, but also creates social and environmental benefits and improves quality of life. At this conference, the main thrust for REDD+ is to move from policy to implementation and action. Though great strides have been made towards this end, there is still much to achieve. The new REDD+ policy text emphasizes transparency, but fails to address how we will verify that countries are sticking to the plan. I think this issue of verification — that international policy and agreements are actually being adhered to — is an area that NASA could support, using the information it collects about our planet from space.

Credit: NASA From NASA Most planes use rigid wings with moving parts. But what if there was a wing that was not only completely flexible, but could be programmed to change on the go? A wing that could adapt to the most efficient shape for any flight, wind conditions or scientific mission? MADCAT is making that wing a reality. The Mission Adaptive Digital Composite Aerostructure Technologies, or MADCAT, team at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, uses carbon fiber composites – a strong and light material made of carbon atoms – to design and test efficient, ultra-light wings that can adapt on the fly. The advanced carbon fiber composite materials are used to create “blocks,” modular units that can be arranged in repeating lattice-based patterns. It includes the same crisscrossing patterns you might see in a garden fence, or even a cherry pie. This variation in patterns creates a structure that can precisely flex and adapt. Computers integrated into the wing use algorithms to help it morph and twist into the most efficient shape mid-flight. An initial, hand-assembled version of the MADCAT wing, illustrating the lattice pattern used in its design. Credit: NASA/Kenny Cheung These “blocks” fit into a space known as a voxel, shorthand for volumetric pixel. Those voxels come together to create the larger wing, in the same way a digital image is made up of smaller pixels. They work like lightweight Lego bricks, forming structures that are able to be deconstructed and reconstructed easily into new shapes. This makes the design scalable, easier to model and adaptive for different tasks and needs. Even repairs and replacements are simplified, since there are fewer unique pieces that make up the aircraft. Finding the right materials to make these components is just as essential as their design. By using a process known as injection molding – where unique materials like thermoplastic polymers are heated into a liquid state, injected into a mold, and then cooled to a solid state –the resulting lattice structures are as stiff and strong as more traditional metal structures. MADCAT also uses new sensory systems developed to give real-time feedback on airflow around a wing, for both testing and in-flight purposes. Each wing is equipped with a series of sensors taking in real-time data from the surroundings. Usually, this kind of network will have each sensor send back raw data, leaving significant lag and processing time. Instead, the system designed for MADCAT groups sensors in the skin of the wing around nodes— small data collection centers. Once the data is gathered, it is processed and passed along to a neighboring node. These work together like a funnel, with each set of sensors taking in data and combining it with its neighbors’, sending information – rather than unprocessed raw data – to the next stage. In other words, the sensors don’t just pass along recorded values – they say what those values actually mean, and can report and interpret airflow patterns in real time, adjusting the structure of the plane’s wing accordingly. The final testing phase for MADCAT has successfully completed, significantly increased from its original demonstration as an adaptive drone at the one-meter scale. Recent testing has proven the scalability of this model, using MADCAT to develop a mid-sized plane with a 14-foot wing span with even fewer types of parts than the original model. This combination of adaptive algorithms, lightweight materials and modular design all make the MADCAT wing a unique technology with the potential to revolutionize air vehicle designs. The project has proven modular ultralight wing design can work on a large scale. As this technology continues to develop and make its way into industry, our planes will become not only more cost effective in their design, construction, and repairs, but increasingly versatile, able to adapt to changing weather conditions or scientific objectives on the fly. MADCAT is forging the path to a smarter, greener and more efficient aviation future.

From lowest to highest, the major layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere. Troposphere. Earth’s troposphere extends from Earth’s surface to, on average, about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) in height, with its height lower at Earth’s poles and higher at the equator. Yet this very shallow layer is tasked with holding all the air plants need for photosynthesis and animals need to breathe, and also contains about 99 percent of all water vapor and aerosols (minute solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere). In the troposphere, temperatures typically go down the higher you go, since most of the heat found in the troposphere is generated by the transfer of energy from Earth’s surface. The troposphere is the densest atmospheric layer, compressed by the weight of the rest of the atmosphere above it. Most of Earth’s weather happens here, and almost all clouds that are generated by weather are found here, with the exception of cumulonimbus thunder clouds, whose tops can rise into the lowest parts of the neighboring stratosphere. Most aviation takes place here, including in the transition region between the troposphere and the stratosphere. Stratosphere. Located between approximately 12 and 50 kilometers (7.5 and 31 miles) above Earth’s surface, the stratosphere is perhaps best known as home to Earth’s ozone layer, which protects us from the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Because of that UV radiation, the higher up you go into the stratosphere, the warmer temperatures become. The stratosphere is nearly cloud- and weather-free, but polar stratospheric clouds are sometimes present in its lowest, coldest altitudes. It’s also the highest part of the atmosphere that jet planes can reach. Mesosphere. Located between about 50 and 80 kilometers (31 and 50 miles) above Earth’s surface, the mesosphere gets progressively colder with altitude. In fact, the top of this layer is the coldest place found within the Earth system, with an average temperature of about minus 85 degrees Celsius (minus 120 degrees Fahrenheit). The very scarce water vapor present at the top of the mesosphere forms noctilucent clouds, the highest clouds in Earth’s atmosphere, which can be seen by the naked eye under certain conditions and at certain times of day. Most meteors burn up in this atmospheric layer. Sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft can reach the mesosphere. Thermosphere. Located between about 80 and 700 kilometers (50 and 440 miles) above Earth’s surface is the thermosphere, whose lowest part contains the ionosphere. In this layer, temperatures increase with altitude due to the very low density of molecules found here. It is both cloud- and water vapor-free. The aurora borealis and aurora australis are sometimes seen here. The International Space Station orbits in the thermosphere. Exosphere. Located between about 700 and 10,000 kilometers (440 and 6,200 miles) above Earth’s surface, the exosphere is the highest layer of Earth’s atmosphere and, at its top, merges with the solar wind. Molecules found here are of extremely low density, so this layer doesn’t behave like a gas, and particles here escape into space. While there’s no weather at all in the exosphere, the aurora borealis and aurora australis are sometimes seen in its lowest part. Most Earth satellites orbit in the exosphere. The Edge of Outer Space. While there’s really no clear boundary between where Earth’s atmosphere ends and outer space begins, most scientists use a delineation known as the Karman line, located 100 kilometers (62 miles) above Earth’s surface, to denote the transition point, since 99.",

High-tide flooding, also known as “sunny day” or nuisance flooding, is an increasingly frequent occurrence in coastal areas around the United States. The Flooding Days Projection Tool is an online dashboard that projects the number of high tide flooding days per year for 97 U.S. cities, based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) impact thresholds. These thresholds provide a safety gap between regular high tide water levels and conditions that result in flooding. Coastal communities are built a certain elevation above sea level with these natural fluctuations in mind. The tool is based on projections of sea level rise and the height of the highest astronomical tides, which vary on a predictable 18.6-year cycle that’s determined by the Moon’s orbit around Earth. Over multiple decades, changes in the Moon’s orbit cause cyclical variations in the height of high and low tides in certain regions. These changes occur slowly.

So NASA does just that — using both unmanned aircraft (the Global Hawk) and manned ones, with pilots in the cockpit the old-fashioned way (the DC-8 and WB-57. But just what is it like to fly through a hurricane? Dryden Flight Research Center DC-8 pilot Dick Ewers flew through Hurricane Earl recently as part of NASA’s hurricane research campaign known as GRIP (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes). He gave the media some insights as he prepared for his final journey through Earl. 1. What’s it like flying through a hurricane? It’s pretty bumpy at times, but most of the time it’s a lot of clouds. Then, as we get closer, we’ll go into some bumps and turbulence. As we break out into the eye, hopefully we’ll be able to see the sky above and all the way down to the water below. That’s very nice. All of a sudden you’re out of the car wash and you’re looking down and can see what’s happening below. Normally it’s about 10 to 15 minutes of excitement per hour. 2. How strong did Hurricane Earl get when you flew through it? At our [altitude] it was about 100 mph, but the worst part is down below. We’re above [the area] where it’s very intense. And when you’re flying in an airplane and through an airmass, and the airmass is moving at 100 mph, you don’t really notice that. But what you do notice is when you come out, the winds drops off and the aircraft rises and falls based on what’s happening around it. So the plane isn’t able to be very level at times. 3. How risky is it? My job is to take the risk out of it. My job is to make sure what I do is safe and doesn’t put the scientists or the instruments at risk. My whole mission is to make sure that plane is back here tonight. Where the risk and danger is, I will take precautions and go around it and do something to avoid something where danger is involved. 4. How many flights did you make through Earl? This will be the fourth and final flight. We thought it was declining yesterday, but it's stronger this morning, so we're going back out. 5. How was the view of the eye? Rarely are storms very crystal clear. This one had a lot of strataform in there, so there were clouds around and above us, and it wasn’t a pristine, clear blue eye. But you were able to see daylight above us and the water below us. I want to say [the eye] was 20 to 25 miles [32 to 40 kilometers] wide inside. You wouldn’t want to be in a boat down there.

    "date": null,
    "content": "6 min read By Alan Buis,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory As a utilities planner for the City and County of San Francisco, David Behar knows that access to the latest information about sea level rise is crucial to his job -- and his city. Behar is climate program director for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. He tracks the latest climate science and leads the translation of that work for the agency and other city departments, working with a team of engineers and planners. His work includes assessing the vulnerability of the city’s water supply, a role for which his expertise as the founding chair for the Water Utility Climate Alliance has prepared him well. The Alliance provides leadership and collaboration on climate change issues to water agencies that supply drinking water to more than 50 million Americans throughout the United States. “My focus is on adaptation planning,” Behar said. “What is it we need to do to be ready for the effects of climate change? What uncertainties do we face?” Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » To understand and plan for current and future threats from sea level rise, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has traditionally relied heavily on global observations and projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the National Research Council (NRC), and the State of California. Because scientific projections typically have uncertainties that complicate decision making, Behar says he’s always interested in new research that helps them understand the short- to medium-term challenges they face. One area of research that’s caught his attention of late is the work Ben Hamlington and his team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California are conducting to understand the impact of ongoing changes in a natural ocean climate cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a key driver of sea level fluctuations along the West Coast. The PDO alternates between warm and cool phases about every five to 20 years, bringing warm or cool waters to the West Coast and raising or lowering sea levels in the process. Understanding these natural sea level variations is important, as they can lead to extended periods of elevated flood risk that compound the impacts of long-term global sea level rise due to global warming. Hamlington’s research shows that a shift in the PDO from a cool to a warm phase in the past decade has led to increasing sea level along the West Coast. Scientists have seen an increase of about 0.4 inches (10 millimeters) a year for the past five years. Based on comparisons to available past observations from tide gauges and satellite altimetry, they project the West Coast will continue to see similar increases for the next few years. Behar says the change in the PDO and its impact on sea level rise will garner a lot of attention among West Coast sea level rise planners because it provides a preview of longer-term, more permanent trends. “There’s not a single planner I know who’s actively using the term 'PDO' in their daily work,” Behar said. “I want our decision makers to know in advance what this trend will look like for our shorelines. From what I’ve seen, nobody is talking about 0.4 inches a year of sea level rise on the West Coast yet. We’ll need to accelerate our short- and medium-term planning a little bit.” Behar says most efforts by planners to adapt to sea level rise employ a step-by-step approach that allows them to be resilient not just to changes taking place today, but also to what they think they’ll see in the next 20 to 30 years, as well as longer-term, more dangerous trends. This approach helps them handle uncertainty. Because of this step-by-step process, Behar says it’s valuable to know what’s happening today on the ground and in the water. “It gives us clues about the short- to medium-term challenges we face,” he said. Now that the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is starting to understand San Francisco’s potential vulnerabilities to sea level rise, Behar says they’re planning adaptation measures. “We need to start thinking about investing in adaptation,” he said. “What’s happening today and over the next 10 years can be as important as projections (of sea level rise) on a century scale. But we see a lot more reporting about long-term projections than we do about observations.” Behar says research on the PDO can give the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission an understanding of short-term challenges that can inform their long-term planning. For example, their adaptation playbook includes investments in green infrastructure, such as establishing wetlands to reduce the effects of wave action. The life cycle of this green infrastructure solution depends almost entirely on the pace of short-term sea level rise. So, this information about the PDO is important for understanding how to design infrastructure for sea level rise solutions. “This new research on the PDO tells us that instead of 2.6 inches (66 millimeters) of sea level rise, we might see 4 inches (100 millimeters) over a decade and 8 inches (200 millimeters) over 20 years, which matches what we’ve seen over the previous century,” he said. “That will be noticeable. This acceleration of sea level rise will be felt most strongly by shorelines that today are at or near the mean high tide line.” Behar says accelerated sea level rise will lead to more frequent flooding, first during king tides but then during regular high tides. King tides, which are associated with the position of the Sun and Moon and are unrelated to climate change, bring an additional 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300 millimeters) of water to coastlines. “Some shorelines in South San Francisco Bay are low gradient (gently sloping) and will flood easily,” he said. “It will also create some vulnerability in the short term because a lot of places are sensitive to 4 inches of sea level rise. In addition to the PDO and El Niño, we’ve got king tides and storm surges, all of which will raise water levels and create a greater urgency for adaptation action. “It’s really important that this information be made available to people in local governments who are in charge of planning sea level adaptation response and that it be made understandable for them through collaboration with the academic community,” he added.

Credit: ©Craig P. Burrows › Larger view By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Earth Science News Team When plants take in too much energy, they don't get fat - they lighten up. They absorb more sunlight than they need to power photosynthesis, and they get rid of the excess solar energy by emitting it as a very faint glow. The light is far too dim for us to notice under normal circumstances, but it can be measured with a spectrometer. Called solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), it's the most accurate signal of photosynthesis that can be observed from space. That's important because, as Earth's climate changes, growing seasons worldwide are also changing in both timing and length. These changes may affect world food production and the pace of greenhouse warming. It's not possible to measure photosynthesis globally from ground level, and lab experiments can't easily replicate all of the environmental factors affecting plant growth, such as water availability, wildfires and competition from other plants - factors that also are changing with the climate. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3), set to launch to the International Space Station later this month, will join its older sibling, OCO-2, in measuring SIF along with its primary target of carbon dioxide concentrations around the globe. The two satellites will be in different orbits: OCO-2 circles Earth from pole to pole, whereas OCO-3 will be mounted on the exterior of the space station, which circles between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. The view from the space station will enable OCO-3 to collect a denser data set than OCO-2 does over the parts of Earth where the most carbon is emitted and stored. The space station orbit will also bring the instrument over any given Earth location at a different time on each orbit, permitting the first dawn-to-dusk observations of how SIF varies over the course of a day. Nicholas Parazoo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is the lead SIF scientist for OCO-3, and he's looking forward to the combined data set to gain insight into remote regions that are relatively little studied. \"The two high-carbon, highly uncertain regions on Earth are the Arctic, where there's a lot of carbon in the ground, and the tropics, where there's a lot of carbon in the plants,\" Parazoo said. \"With OCO-2 and OCO-3 combined, we're going to observe those regions in unprecedented detail.\" Parazoo and his colleagues will use previously developed algorithms to extract the SIF signal from the full set of data collected by OCO-3. The instrument consists of three spectrometers, each observing different bands of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Every kind of gas molecule in the atmosphere - oxygen, carbon dioxide and the others - absorbs sunlight in a unique set of wavelengths. A spectrometer looking at the right wavelengths will see this absorption as a distinctive series of dark lines, like the spectral bar code of a particular gas. OCO-3's three spectrometers are tuned to two wavelength bands covering different parts of carbon dioxide's bar code and one band with an oxygen bar code. As it happens, the oxygen spectrometer records not only wavelengths absorbed by oxygen, but also nearby wavelengths where SIF shines particularly strongly. \"So the SIF measurement wasn't by design but an extremely fortunate bonus,\" Parazoo said.

    "content": "6 min read If there were no need for massive batteries, electric propulsion could dramatically reduce aviation’s contribution to climate change from carbon dioxide emissions. But what if the plane, itself, were the battery? Suppose an aircraft’s skin or floor, for example, could serve double-duty by storing and dispensing electrical energy without adding substantially to the weight of the materials currently used. That could bring us a lot closer to practical electric flight on a meaningful scale. What’s wrong with batteries? For one thing, they’re very heavy. Today’s best batteries would increase a small plane’s weight by about a third. A large plane’s weight would go up by a similar fraction even with highly improved batteries, four times as efficient as today’s best. Lifting all that battery weight eats up a lot of the energy that would be better put toward moving people and cargo. Batteries take up a lot of space, too. And accommodating them, whether inside or outside the plane, increases drag—air resistance that wastes still more energy. The goal of eliminating—or at least reducing—the need for separate batteries drives a team of some 35 scientists and engineers, working at four NASA centers and led by Patricia Loyselle of NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Their project, called M-SHELLS (for Multifunctional Structures for High-Energy Lightweight Load-bearing Storage), falls under NASA’s Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program. TACP supports efforts that have a high risk of failure because of their ultra-challenging nature, but which will pay off big if they succeed. And in this case, the benefits could potentially go far beyond aeronautics. “We would love to see our developments incorporated in things like cars as well as aircraft,” Loyselle said. “You could use it for some of the structures that go up into space. It could be for buildings. It could be pretty much anywhere you need energy and a structure at the same time.” For the M-SHELLS project to succeed, it needs to create material that is as strong as today’s aircraft-construction materials, can store large amounts of energy and both charge and dispense that energy rapidly. “You don't want to sit around for four hours waiting for the battery to recharge,” Loyselle said. “And if somebody wants to change altitude, we want to be able to deliver the power quickly.” The team is trying to merge two kinds of energy technology. “We are developing what's called a hybrid supercapacitor that’s got the qualities of a battery as well as the qualities of a supercapacitor,” Loyselle said, noting that batteries are able to store a lot of energy whereas supercapacitors are speed demons for charging and discharging. Some newly available materials may provide the means. “Some of these new nano materials are very, very strong,” Loyselle said. “And if you have that real small particle size, reactions happen much faster.” Large all-electric planes will require the ability to pack much more energy into a given amount of battery—whether M-SHELLS or the standard kinds—than any developments currently visible on the horizon. So when it comes to commercial transport aircraft, M-SHELLS products in the near term are most likely to be used for hybrid planes that use a combination of electricity and jet fuel much as a Prius uses electricity and gasoline. Hybrid turbo-electric planes hold a lot of promise, according to Jim Felder, a NASA aerospace engineer specializing in aircraft propulsion. “If electrified propulsion really works out for large aircraft,” he said, “it could be as big a change as the transition from piston-engine propeller planes to jet engines.” Part of the electrical advantage goes back to the problem of drag. Air pushes back against objects moving through it, and fighting that resistance wastes energy, whether from electric batteries or jet fuel. Though engineers streamline planes as much as possible, a certain amount of drag is unavoidable. Ironically, standard jet engines are deliberately built to create drag in order to slow down the air rushing into them. They are too large to be positioned where they could take advantage of drag caused by the airplane’s body and, in any case, that airflow is too uneven for jet turbine engines to use efficiently. But fans driven by electric motors are tolerant of uneven airflow and small enough to place where they can use the aircraft’s unavoidable drag, eliminating the need to design additional drag into the system. “With electric motors, we can take advantage of a loss that's already on the vehicle to avoid another loss,” Felder said, “and we increase the overall efficiency.” Adding electricity to the mix also enables designers to solve a problem that afflicts all regular jet aircraft. Jet engines have to be designed for the maximum demand that will be placed on them, which occurs as the plane is taking off and climbing. But the large engines capable of lifting a plane are actually too big for the job of cruising at a constant altitude, which is how an aircraft spends most of its time. And oversized engines don’t operate at peak efficiency, which wastes fuel. Jet-fuel engines could be sized for cruising at maximum efficiency if electric motors were to supplement them at takeoff. That would reduce carbon dioxide emissions as well as contrails, those long, thin clouds that form in the wake of jet engines and may also have a planet-warming effect. In fact, any substitution of electricity for jet fuel helps to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions—assuming, of course, that the electricity is generated in a way that emits little or no carbon dioxide. If electric motors did no more than taxi the plane on the ground, Felder said, “that could be worth a 3 to 4 percent reduction in fuel burn. Just that.” So Felder and his aircraft-designing colleagues at NASA are pulling for Loyselle’s team to succeed. “If they can build every square inch of a plane out of M-SHELLS, I would be happy as a clam,” Felder said. “If they can do it without adding substantially to the mass of the vehicle, perfect!” NASA and Boeing are currently evaluating an updated approach to the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator… In the future, aircraft with long, thin wings supported by aerodynamic braces could help airlines… Shortly after dawn on March 27,",

Depending on atmospheric conditions, a contrail may evaporate quickly or it may last. The persistent ones, buffeted by wind, can spread out into diffuse cirrus clouds. As delicate as these clouds appear, they have a significant warming effect on the planet. Although cirrus clouds serve as cooling sunshades during the day, they also act as warming blankets both day and night, preventing the Earth from cooling off after the day’s sunbathing as much as it would without the clouds.

NASA researchers are using satellite and ground-based observations to track these impacts on our air, land, water, and climate. These datasets have been collected in a free and openly available online dashboard. The NASA COVID-19 Dashboard features data collected by Earth-observing satellites, instruments aboard the International Space Station, and sensitive ground-based networks.

For example, scientists at NASA’s Ames Research Center discovered that emptier parking lots near closed, non-essential businesses, in combination with cleaner air from less surface transportation, meant that heat from the sun radiating off dark asphalt and cement surfaces did not stay trapped near the ground as long.

    "content": "6 min read Imagine a rocket emerging from Earth’s atmosphere. Its nose cone opens and out comes a flying carpet. It had been folded and rolled into a cylinder just 3 feet in diameter and 5 feet long. But freed from the launch vehicle, it unfurls to its full expanse: two-thirds the size of a football field and 1 inch thick. Now imagine that this is one of 2,500 spaceborne magic carpets flying side-by-side in tight formation, covering an area of 3.5 square miles (9 square kilometers) in Earth orbit. That’s 1,670 football fields, still only an inch thick. What are they doing up there? Capturing the sun’s energy and beaming it down to Earth to make electricity. “What we’re proposing, somewhat audaciously, is to develop the technology that would enable one to build the largest-ever-built space structures,” said Harry Atwater, one of three Caltech professors leading the Space Solar Power Initiative, or SSPI. The other two are Ali Hajimiri and Sergio Pellegrino, who is also a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “The work I do at Caltech benefits enormously from the things I do at JPL,” Pellegrino said, “and from the people at JPL.” SSPI is a partnership between Caltech and Northrup Grumman, which is providing up to $17.5 million over three years to develop the key components. A quarter of Earth’s population lacks access to reliable electricity, according to the U.N. Development Programme. More than half of those people have no electricity at all. For many, orbiting solar panels could be a solution. The SSPI team draws a parallel with mobile phones. “In a lot of places like sub-Saharan Africa, you don’t have a landline (phone) network,” Hajimiri said. “It's easier and more economical to deploy a wireless network there.” Similarly, he said, in places without power plants or major transmission capabilities, it’s a lot easier to install ground stations that can receive power from spacecraft and transmit it to local communities. According to Atwater, the receiving antennas would not have to displace any productive land use. They could be installed like chicken wire over farm fields, for example. Or they could be embedded within ground-based solar panels, enabling them to deliver power day and night. The orbiting system would beam energy to Earth in the form of microwaves, to be converted to electricity on the ground. Would the streaming microwaves pose a safety hazard? “The energy density you are transmitting is no more than what you get by standing outside in the sun or using your cell phone,” Hajimiri said. In fact, he said, the microwaves would be safer than sunlight because, unlike the sun’s UV rays, they are not ionizing. “It can’t induce chemical change,” he said. “It can just generate slight heating.” In orbit, a solar panel can bathe in cloud-free, high-noon sunshine 24/7 with the potential of harnessing energy wavelengths that the atmosphere absorbs before they can reach ground-based panels. “You look at the seasons, day-night cycle and all of that versus having it in space at geostationary orbit (an orbit where a satellite appears to hover over one spot on Earth’s surface), and there is an advantage in space, factor of 9,” Pellegrino said. In other words, a receiving antenna on Earth’s surface will provide 9 times as much electricity as a ground-based solar panel of the same size. Harvesting energy in space has been discussed for decades. So why hasn’t it gotten off the ground? Because launching the necessary equipment has been prohibitively expensive. But with technological innovations underway, the amount of mass that has to be lifted is shrinking to cost-effective levels. A number of organizations, foreign and domestic, are tackling the problem, but the SSPI team thinks they may lead the pack. “Our approach uses ultra-lightweight integrated circuits, photovoltaics and structures,” Hajimiri said, “that make it about two orders of magnitude lighter than any competing effort I am aware of.” The SSPI system’s basic unit is what the team calls a “multifunctional tile,” which soaks up sunlight, converts it to radio waves and beams them to Earth. In its current design, each tile measures about 4 by 4 inches (10 by 10 cm) and is about 1 inch (3 cm) thick with the ability to flatten when packaged for launch. It’s projected to be incredibly lightweight: about 0.03 ounce (about 0.8 gram) per tile. “So this makes it possible to have it launched at a cost point that is better than or at most on parity with terrestrial solar power,” Hajimiri said. And according to Atwater, when the components are manufactured at high volume, power from SSPI systems is likely to fall below the cost of electricity from coal or natural gas. Each flying carpet—or, more accurately, each independent spacecraft—will consist of 360,000 tiles. As previously noted, it will cover an area two-thirds the size of a football field, yet it will weight only about 816 pounds (370 kg). Each spacecraft will be so large and lightweight that the pressure of sunlight beating on it is likely to nudge it off course, requiring periodic correction. Its operators on the ground may be able to steer it, at least in part, by using that pressure the way a sailboat uses the wind. “Just like a sailor on the high seas,” Atwater said. “You sail with the wind and against it” to steer your boat, though he acknowledges that small thrusters will also probably be needed to keep the system at its proper orientation to Earth and the sun. The fleet of 2,500 formation-flying spacecraft in each solar-energy system would comprise 900 million functionally independent tiles. The power generated by each tile would be transmitted to Earth by the same tile. This modular approach makes the system very robust. Lose a few tiles to solar flares or micrometeorites and the system laughs it off. Is manufacturing so many units doable? “Do you know how many cell-phone handsets there are in the world?” Atwater asked. “Several billion.” And cell phones, he pointed out, are much more complex than SSPI tiles. “So we already have manufacturing infrastructure for making lightweight electronics at the same scale. “We’re talking about building a new industry, to be sure,” he said. “But it's not a pipe dream.” On its record-breaking pass by the Sun late last year, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe captured… NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey have been mapping the planets since Apollo.

This rhetorical question, variously attributed to Benjamin Franklin, Michael Faraday and Thomas Edison, is meant to suggest that a novel discovery or invention whose ultimate utility is not yet known should be viewed as a bouncing bundle of potential. Along these lines, the eight-minute video Element 19 can be considered a sort of birth announcement. It heralds what Caltech’s Resnick Sustainability Institute, which produced the video and funded the work it describes, calls a breakthrough in sustainable chemistry. The baby in this metaphor is a catalyst that, unlike its cousins that pervade modern industry, is based not on precious metals like gold and platinum, but rather on something you can get out of a banana: potassium. The father (or perhaps more accurately if we ignore the gender problem, the mother) is a Caltech grad student named Anton Toutov, who reports that the delivery was long and difficult. This new technology is already capable of manufacturing chemicals used in pharmaceuticals, agriculture and cosmetics in a much more environmentally friendly way than traditional methods. The catalyst requires little or no processing with petrochemicals and operates at much lower temperatures than standard catalytic methods, both of which keep its carbon footprint tiny. It can reduce air pollution from certain kinds of transportation fuels and, unlike the precious-metal processes it replaces, it produces no toxic waste.

    "content": "By Bob Silberg, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory The view from space is helping solar panel users monitor the efficiency of their systems. You’ve gone solar! Thousands of dollars worth of photovoltaic panels sit atop your roof, harnessing the sun’s energy to power your lights and devices. But has your investment been paying off as richly as it should? A pair of satellites orbiting Earth at about a 10th of the distance to the moon can help you find out. “You just don’t know how efficiently the system was performing unless you know how much sunlight actually hit that location,” said Adrian De Luca, marketing head for Locus Energy. His company enables solar-panel users to evaluate the performance of their systems. The idea is simple: The amount of sunlight falling onto your solar panels multiplied by the amount of electricity they’re designed to produce per unit of sunlight equals the amount of electricity your system should produce. Compare that to what you’re actually getting and you know whether all is well or something needs to be fixed. But how can you measure the sunlight? “If you build a 20-megawatt plant in the middle of the Mohave Desert, that’s a huge investment and you will bear the cost of having high-grade sensors,” De Luca said. “But for light commercial and residential systems—say, 150 kilowatts and below—it’s not economically feasible to include a high-grade sensor.” For those customers, Locus Energy offers reports based on information from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system, a collaboration between NASA and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Virtual Irradiance “The satellite imagery comes out in at least 15-minute intervals at a resolution of roughly one square kilometer,” said Shawn Kerrigan, the company’s chief technology officer. “We capture whatever is made available and run it through our processing engine. We’ll distill out what the cloud cover is and, using our models, estimate how much sunlight is getting through.” This enables the company’s Virtual Irradiance software to calculate how much electricity each customer’s system should have produced over any given time period. De Luca points out that even a system producing as predicted might have a hidden problem. “If there was a lot more sunlight than was expected at that location for that given month,” he said, “then you might actually be underperforming.” Those multi-megawatt installations with costly high-grade sunlight sensors can benefit from satellite-based reports, too, Kerrigan said. “The ground irradiance sensor may have data outages that you’ll want to fill. Or it may accumulate dirt and debris at the same rate as the panels, so they mask soiling on the PV (photovoltaic) side.” (\"Soiling\" is the accumulation of the dust, animal excrement or other forms of dirt on solar panels, which can decrease the system's efficiency.) According to De Luca, Locus Energy’s software can provide reports tailored to any location within the continental U.S. or Hawaii, to a resolution of one square kilometer (less than half a square mile). “It makes good business sense,” said Nathan Morrill, national procurement manager for Extra Space Storage, Inc. (ESS), which is one of Locus Energy’s largest customers. ESS has installed solar panels at more than 150 of its buildings throughout the U.S., and uses GOES-based reports from Locus Energy to monitor their performance. “We can’t just slap them up there and think that everything’s going to be good,” Morrill said. “It’s a big investment on our part. We need to know what these systems are producing. Without the Locus system, we just wouldn’t be able to do that, not in a very easy way.” Learn how the GOES satellites are also helping to keep our major electrical grids in balance.

    "content": "4 min read By Bob Silberg,NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory What do lighthouses have in common with a groundbreaking spacecraft propulsion system? And how can the technology they share help us here on Earth to generate electricity more efficiently? All are applications of Fresnel lenses, which simulate the ability of regular lenses to refract and focus light, but with much less thickness and weight. Their first practical use is thought to have been enabling 19th-century lighthouses to project warning beacons many miles out over the ocean. In the latter part of the 20th century, an engineer named Mark O’Neill was among the first to see these lenses as a solution to the problem of costly photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. With Fresnel lenses to concentrate the light, a smaller cell area can generate the same amount of electricity as a larger cell area under unenhanced light. Further, by bending the lens to form an arch, the lens becomes able to focus the light satisfactorily even if it doesn’t precisely hold its shape—a big advantage over its flat counterpart and an even bigger advantage over mirrors. When NASA was preparing technology for its Deep Space 1 mission, which would need electricity to power not only its instruments but also the first ion engine to be used as a principal means of spacecraft propulsion, it looked to O’Neill’s lens. Focusing sunlight would maximize the output of the “multi-junction” photovoltaic cells it was going to use, which utilize more of sunlight’s wavelengths than standard silicon cells. But O’Neill’s panels, intended for use on the ground, were much too big and heavy for the job. “You’d look at that thing and say ‘no, this is not going to work for space,’” said Mike Piszczor of NASA’s Glenn Research Center, who worked with O’Neill’s team at Entech Solar Inc. and his own team at Glenn to adapt the device. They shrank the lens from 3 by 10 feet (about 1 by 3 meters) to only about 3 by 8 inches (4 by 20 cm) and reconfigured it to be more suitable for use on a spacecraft. Each lens focused light onto a series of five photovoltaic cells. With 720 of these miniaturized lens-cell modules packed into two arrays, dubbed the Solar Concentrator Arrays with Refractive Linear Element Technology (SCARLET), NASA’s Deep Space 1 drew the electricity it needed to fly by asteroid Braille and comet Borrelly, among other accomplishments. When O’Neill revisited his terrestrial solar panels, he found that the price of the traditional kind—silicon cells without concentrators—had dropped substantially, largely due to China’s involvement in the industry. So he went back to the drawing board. Just as the original terrestrial module had been adapted for use in space, O’Neill and his company, working together with Piszczor and others at NASA’s Glenn facility, drew from the space version to improve the module intended for use on the ground. “There's a lot of synergy back and forth because if you can save material, it saves weight in space and it saves costs terrestrially,” O’Neill said. “So we copied a lot of what we had developed for NASA and made the lenses very, very thin, like ten thousandths of an inch thick, where in the past we made them an eighth of an inch thick.” Similarly, they made the radiator that rejects the waste heat much thinner. The result was SolarVolt, a system that concentrated the sun’s rays 20-fold onto its solar cells. It won a prestigious R&D 100 Award in",

    "content": "We can expect more weird and wacky weather in the future, and it’s thanks to climate change, say scientists. According to Dr. Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), as the planet warms up, even if it’s by a relatively small amount, the result will be more extreme weather. “By itself, global warming doesn’t cause extreme conditions, but it makes naturally-occurring events even more extreme,” explained Meehl during a visit to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory earlier this month. And it’s those extremes — not the averages — that cause the most damage to humans, wildlife and ecosystems. By combining real-world observations with climate models, researchers at NCAR have come up with projections for future changes in weather extremes. Climate models, which are akin to weather forecasts, predict future climate change by taking into account the atmosphere, oceans, land, sea ice and the complicated interactions between them. They also include the effects of changes in greenhouse gas levels, the heat output of the sun and volcanic explosions here on Earth. Today’s climate models can resolve climate and weather effects down to a scale of 35 km (22 miles) — enough to be able to identify category 3 hurricanes. Meehl, who has been active in writing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change assessment reports, says that we can look forward to: More frequent and longer-lasting heatwaves. In the U.S., for example, there will be many more heatwaves in the Pacific northwest where at present there are few. More moisture from individual precipitation events (rainfall, snowfall, etc.), but longer dry spells in between those events. Ultimately, soils will get drier in the southwest U.S., where there will be more droughts, and wetter in the northwest. Interestingly, there will be fewer hurricanes and tropical cyclones, but the ones that form will be much more intense. As oceans warm up, they provide more energy that fuels storms and makes them more violent. But the number of storms is likely to drop as a result of changes in the vertical wind structure of the atmosphere. More record hot temperatures and less record cold temperatures. Right now, the ratio of the number of record high to record low temperatures is about 2:1. But a new paper from Meehl et al. published in Geophysical Research Letters (\"Relative increase of record high maximum temperatures compared to record low minimum temperatures in the U.S.\") says that ratio will become 20:1 by mid-century, and 50:1 by the end of the century. Note that even in a warming climate, we still get cold snaps — Meehl says it’s the relative proportions of cold and hot snaps that change. (Read this and this to learn more about why it is possible, and natural, to have cold spells in a warming world.) (For more on the difference between weather and climate, take a look here.)

Credit: Peshkova/Shutterstock.com By Bob Silberg NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Natural photosynthesis—the remarkable ability of plants to transform sunlight into useful energy­—powers virtually all life on Earth. But that’s not enough for some people. Caltech chemistry professor Nate Lewis and his colleagues aim to show Mother Nature how it really should be done. Their goal is to produce fuel as energy-dense as gasoline and as friendly to the environment as a daffodil. “Plants are the wrong color to be optimum energy-conversion machines,” Lewis said. “They should be black like solar cells, not green.” He also points out that plants max out their energy conversion at only 10 percent of the light intensity available on a bright, sunny day. The remaining 90 percent of the solar energy they receive goes unused. Nature presumably has good reasons for wasting so much sunlight. After all, a plant only has to harness enough energy to run its own metabolism, not to satisfy the needs of an energy-hungry civilization. But the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), of which Lewis is scientific director, has more ambitious goals. According to Lewis, artificial photosynthesis will compare to what plants do in much the same way that artificial flight compares to what birds do. We take our inspiration from nature and then strive to surpass it. JCAP, a U.S. Department of Energy “Energy Innovation Hub,” is America’s largest research program dedicated to turning sunshine into fuel. The artificial photosynthesis system it is developing promises to produce energy-packed liquid fuel at 10 times the efficiency of plants, using only sunlight, water and carbon dioxide as ingredients. Unlike fossil fuels, JCAP’s product will not contribute to the climate-changing greenhouse effect. And unlike some biofuels, such as those derived from corn, it will not compete with food crops for farmland, require fertilizer or consume large amounts of water. Just set it up in the sunshine and watch the fuel drip out. Added oomph Why work on converting sunlight to liquid fuel when we’ve already got photovoltaic solar panels that can convert sunlight to electricity? Because electricity can’t supply large vehicles with enough oomph. “Forty percent of global transportation—heavy-duty trucks, ships and aircraft—cannot be electrified,” Lewis said. “You’ve got to find a high-energy-density, carbon-neutral liquid fuel for global commerce.” Some 120 scientists and engineers are working on the task at JCAP’s headquarters at Caltech and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and other affiliated institutions.

Scientists rely on precise numerical models to answer questions like this one. As the models used in predicting long-term sea level rise improve, so too do the projections derived from them. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have discovered a way to make current models more accurate. In doing so, they have also gotten one step closer to understanding what Antarctica's ice sheet - and the sea level rise that occurs as it melts - will look like centuries from now. \"Unlike most current models, we included solid Earth processes - such as the elastic rebound of the bedrock under the ice, and the impact of changes in sea level very close to the ice sheet,\" said JPL's Eric Larour, first author of the study. \"We also examined these models at a much higher resolution than is typically used - we zoomed in on areas of bedrock that were about 1 kilometer instead of the usual 20 kilometers.\" The scientists found that projections for the next 100 years are within 1 percent of previous projections for that time period; however, further into the future, they observed some significant differences. \"We found that around the year",

By Bob Silberg NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Some primal termite knocked on wood And tasted it, and found it good, And that is why your Cousin May Fell through the parlor floor today. — Ogden Nash If you’ve had to deal with termites in your house, you probably hate their guts. But not Jared Leadbetter. He loves termites, especially their guts! \"It turns out termites do something we'd like to do,\" said Dr. Leadbetter, a microbiologist at Caltech. That something is turning wood into biofuel, and doing it at a nice, civilized temperature, pressure and acidity level. Jared Leadbetter, microbiologist at Caltech But what Leadbetter is after isn't really the biofuel termites use to power their daily functions, it's the substance they convert wood into on the way to forming what they ultimately use for energy -- an intermediate substance called \"pyruvate.\" He says pyruvate is to chemistry what a major airline hub is to travel. \"If you can get to Chicago O'Hare, you may not want to go to La Crosse, but it's a pretty short flight to get to Lansing and a pretty short flight to get to Fort Wayne and some of these other local airports,\" he said. \"Termites are basically getting us to Chicago. And then they go to La Crosse and we want to go somewhere else, but we actually know how to get to all those regional airports from Chicago.\" That is, we know how to make lots of useful products from pyruvate. But we don't know how to make pyruvate from wood, or from woody plant materials like rice hulls, corn cobs and switchgrass. So how do termites make that critical journey to pyruvate? They have friends in the right places. \"Termites don't digest wood by themselves,\" Leadbetter said. \"In fact, if you eliminate the microbes from their guts, they are unable to digest wood at all.\" It takes guts According to the microbiologist, there are hundreds of species of microbes in termite guts found nowhere else in nature. \"Every new generation of termite acquires its microbes from the previous generation,\" Leadbetter said. \"The insect and its microbes are a system that has been refined by 100 million years of evolution.\" They work together to dismantle wood into its components, extract the sugars, and ferment them into something the termite can use for energy. And they do it very efficiently, with little adverse effect on the environment -- unless you count your house collapsing, if that's what they happen to be using as raw material. \"A lot of termites are desert-adapted, so they are degrading wood when water is at a premium,\" Leadbetter said. \"Well, we live in a society where water is at a premium.\" Also, unlike some of our fellow creatures (I'm talking to you, cows), termites process their food into energy without producing copious amounts of methane, which is not only embarrassing in social situations, but also a potent greenhouse gas. \"Domestic animals and rice paddies are major sources of methane globally,\" Leadbetter said. \"A cow can lose up to about 20% of the electrons in each mouthful of food as methane and termites often lose less than 2%.\" He said that understanding why cows and rice paddies produce so much methane while termites produce so little may one day enable us to significantly reduce the amount of this gas that is released into the atmosphere and heats up the planet. But what really drives Dr. Leadbetter is an intense distaste for wasting resources. Take sugarcane, which is one of the crops currently processed into ethanol and used as a biofuel. \"Between 50 and 70 percent of the energy in every sugar cane is not in the sugar that you squeeze out of it,\" he said. He explained that most of that energy remains in a woody waste product called \"bagasse,\" much of which winds up in landfills. \"That's tremendous potential,\" Leadbetter said. \"Anytime you could improve your yield by two, that is a pretty interesting idea.\" Similar stories can be told about corncobs, rice hulls, and other agricultural waste. \"We have plant material, sometimes that we are already burning as an energy source, and maybe we could do something else with it that doesn't involve dirty combustion,\" he said. Stayin’ alive According to Leadbetter, the termite holds the key to unlocking all of this potential. But understanding how to do it won’t be easy. People have enlisted the help of microbes before, but never with this degree of complexity. \"For 6,000 years,\" he said, \"we've been making beer, wine and bread using yeast,\" which is a single-cell organism in the kingdom of fungi. \"But as we move into this next stage of wanting to turn more complex materials into something we might use, it's not going to be an organism. It's not going to be 10 organisms. It's going to be a microbial community involving hundreds of organisms and thousands of enzymes.\" He estimated that it could take from 10 to 25 years before we understand the process well enough to harness it. Currently, scientists are having a tough time just keeping the microbes alive outside of a termite. \"The major challenge remains being able to grow these organisms which only grow in a termite and say, well let's add one other place on Earth where they'll grow. Let's say in this test tube in the laboratory,\" Leadbetter said. He's had some success with a half-dozen or so of these microbes, but there are several hundred involved in the process. \"We have to ask, why is it we can't grow them?\" he said. \"It's because they are in some ways dependent on each other.\" Unraveling the intricate inner workings of the termite has occupied Dr. Leadbetter for years, and promises to do so for many years to come. But even his fascination with termites has its limits. \"I love them,\" he said. \"But they say you shouldn't bring your work home with you.\" \"I like to say that I work in a miniature Alice in Wonderland,\" Leadbetter said. \"It's this teeming, churning craziness -- this crazy zoo of all these different organisms. They come in all sorts of wild shapes and sizes and they're doing all sorts of different interesting things.\" And similar micro-worlds are everywhere. \"We can go for a walk in a rainforest in Costa Rica, and that's a fascinating place,\" Leadbetter said. \"But there are also these little miniature rainforests, if you will, all around us that we may not even notice. \"People will talk about what's in a gram of soil. Well, a gram has lots of microliter environments in it. So even one gram of soil might be a Manhattan of complexity. And to understand the little neighborhoods is going to be a very complex process.\" This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

So the tips of the blades generate most of the turbine's power—as much as 90 percent, according to David North, an engineer at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. \"What if I had a machine that was just the tip of the blade?\" North said. \"That's really the idea of airborne wind energy—get rid of 400 tons of tower and concrete, and just fly the blade tip.

Credit: NASA By Ruth Marlaire, Ames Research Center NASA’s astrobiologists study microbial life to understand how it transformed a rocky Earth into the thriving, diverse, life-sustaining planet we inhabit today. These studies of photosynthetic ‘green’ algae are creating sparks for new ‘green technologies’ on Earth and future human space exploration missions. “Once we understand these microbial recycling pathways, we can apply these processes in imaginative and innovative ways to solve problems on Earth, and in various space microgravity environments,” said Leslie Bebout, a research scientist in the Exobiology Branch at NASA’s Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. Exobiology scientists at NASA Ames are conducting astrobiology research into the origin and early evolution of life, the potential of life to adapt to different environments, and the implications for life elsewhere. Goals of this research are to determine the nature of the most primitive organisms and the environments in which they evolved, and how those microbes and environments have changed over time to produce the world we have today. These findings are helping scientists understand the transformations of Earth and its atmosphere throughout time. This requires an investigation of the evolution of genes, metabolic pathways, and microbial species, subject to long-term environmental change. Such an investigation will show the co-evolution of, and interactions within, microbial communities that drive the major recycling processes on Earth. These constantly flowing cycles of energy and elements are what make Earth unique, and are critical to the development of new technologies for sustainable energy, food and water processing. “It may surprise people to learn that NASA’s space science research has so many direct applications to the development of ‘greentech.’ Many of the organisms we study are important producers of hydrogen, methane and lipids that can be used as carbon neutral fuels, and other products,” said Orlando Santos, chief of the Exobiology Branch at Ames. Putting microbes to the test Microbial ecology links this research together. By studying microbes in a given environment, scientists can observe how they thrive and interact with each other. It is important to note that microbial communities are profoundly influenced by their environment. By looking at geographic location, or a shift to short- or long-term environmental perturbations, scientists can determine how microbial populations and processes differ in response to different environments. A few years ago, Ames Exobiology scientists formed the Algae for Exploration (ALEX) group, which studies various types of lipids produced by different algal species under specific conditions, and started applying this research to new technologies. They found that non-traditional species of algae can produce the lipids needed to produce low-cost fuels. To explore this notion and determine other NASA synergies, they met with many industry and research colleagues to discuss our country’s enormous energy-consumption demands and obstacles to produce algae for biofuel on a commercial scale. For the past 20 years, commercial algal growers have used traditional species to produce food supplements and nutraceuticals. According to these growers, large quantities of new type, non-traditional species of algae would have to be grown and harvested in rapid and constant succession to produce biofuel. Several hurdles currently hamper biofuel production from algae; two of the key challenges are a lack of automation and reduction of labor costs. Large algal producers need real-time information about the health, or stress, of the algae cells in ever-changing weather and laboratory culture conditions. Automation is the modern solution that can help provide timely decisions for rapid crop turnovers. As it happened, NASA also was interested in this technology to study similar microbial species in changing environments. For NASA’s purposes, water-filled bioreactors are used for these studies. “Imagine acres and acres of tomatoes growing from seed to harvest in just a few days,” said Bebout. “How could the health of all those plants be managed and harvested successfully, and at such a rapid rate?” To help them develop that automated technology, ALEX scientists collaborated with engineers from the Mission Development Division at Ames and students from Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, Calif. Together; they designed and constructed two prototypes of a device called RoboAlgae. These RoboAlgae sensors float in algae-growing systems, where they wirelessly transmit chemical and physical data to the grower. Future versions will assess the photosynthetic efficiency of the sensors, so other environmental parameters can be managed, such as irradiance, temperature, mixing, and response to changing weather conditions. As an added feature, Ames researchers are modeling this data to assess and predict changes in the health of algae crops. This tool will minimize, or prevent, algae-growth crop crashes. NASA‘s interest in microbial research also includes atmospheric studies. The greenhouse gas methane is a biomarker for life on other planets. To study this atmospheric gas, ALEX scientists collaborated with the Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant (SWPCP), Calif., to investigate microbial methane cycling and assess carbon flow through several California sewage treatment systems. The same sensitive techniques used to study Mars-relevant environments were applied to assess methane cycling in the SWPCP open ponds. The carbon footprint of current SWPCP operations was of particular interest to NASA scientists, and also was valuable data for the Sunnyvale operators and engineering team. Results showed that pond organisms oxidize dissolved methane extremely efficiently, up to 83 percent. Other non-dissolved gases escaped in bubbles too quickly for microbial decomposition. Project results also showed that these algal oxidation ponds are a very low-energy way to reduce greenhouse gas methane, and provide quantitative data for altering carbon use in the future. In addition, the data provide insights into microbial processing of human biological waste, information as valuable on Earth, as it is in space. “NASA’s future includes long-term human space flights,” said Bebout. \"As part of the human exploration studies, we are studying photosynthesis in space, which can consume carbon dioxide exhaled by astronauts, produce oxygen, and recycle nitrogen-containing wastes.\" A matter of gravity To understand the potential role photosynthesis could play in human exploration, ALEX researchers started developing laboratory models. They are using data from algae, which are ideal specimens because of their small size, metabolic flexibility, and robustness. Tapping into the commercial interest, NASA collaborated with Heinz Walz GmbH, a producer of photosynthesis measuring systems, and developed two prototype chlorophyll fluorometers, called Space PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) and Space PAM II. These devices rapidly measure the flow of electrons through algae’s photosynthetic (metabolic) processes. Space PAM fluorometers are already proving valuable to scientists. Scientists know that microbes perform differently in space than on Earth, but were never able to determine the cause. Was the difference due to gravity, or radiation? For the first time, scientists have the technology to determine these answers. Recently, Space PAM was integrated into a “gravity satellite” concept, called GraviSat, which was supported by NASA's Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development program. This new technology uses algae grown in tiny, thimble-like wells, and spins them on a plastic disk, the size of a mini-compact disk. The disk's rotation generates artificial gravity in the wells similar to Earth's gravity. A second, non-spinning disk grows algae in micro-gravity. The Space PAM technology then measures the photosynthetic efficiencies of the algae growing side-by-side in these two different gravity environments. When astronauts go into space, they must bring everything they need to survive. Living quarters on a spaceship require careful planning and management of limited resources. As part of that management for deep space exploration, ALEX researchers want to cultivate these microorganisms in space. For this, the ALEX scientists collaborated with the Solar Energy and Biofuels Laboratory at the University of Texas, Austin. They jointly designed the Surface Attached Bio-Reactor (SABR), a bioreactor that functions in the absence of gravity. SABR was inspired by a tree leaf model that pulls water through a biological system using evaporation and requires no electrical pump. Preliminary ground-based data have shown that SABR can cultivate algal cells using 20 times less water than conventional systems. Moreover, it can grow other types of microbes for biofuel, food, and pharmaceuticals production, which also has terrestrial applications. SABR is expected to have significant impact in space and terrestrial bioreactor technologies, enabling highly efficient and compact systems with reduced energy and water requirements. Scientists and engineers, in private and public sectors, are working together now more than ever to develop versatile microbial engineering platforms that use significantly less water and energy, and can optimize algal crop production and precious nutritional resources recycling.

Understanding its role in the atmosphere is critical for determining the lifetime of methane, a powerful contributor to climate change. The hydroxyl (OH) radical, a molecule made up of one hydrogen atom, one oxygen atom with a free (or unpaired) electron, is one of the most reactive gases in the atmosphere and regularly breaks down other gases, effectively ending their lifetimes. In this way, OH is the main check on the concentration of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is second only to carbon dioxide in contributing to increasing global temperatures. With the rise of methane emissions into the atmosphere, scientists historically thought that might cause the amount of hydroxyl radicals to be used up on the global scale and, as a result, extend methane's lifetime, currently estimated to be nine years. However, in addition to looking globally at primary sources of OH and the amount of methane and other gases it breaks down, this new research takes into account secondary OH sources, recycling that happens after OH breaks down methane and reforms in the presence of other gases, which has been observed on regional scales before. \"OH concentrations are pretty stable over time,\" said atmospheric chemist and lead author Julie Nicely at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"When OH reacts with methane, it doesn't necessarily go away in the presence of other gases, especially nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). The break down products of its reaction with methane react with NO or NO2 to reform OH. So OH can recycle back into the atmosphere.\" Nitrogen oxides are one set of several gases that contribute to recycling OH back into the atmosphere, according to Nicely's research, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.

Credit: Steven Sobieszczyk, U.S. Geological Survey, public domain By Esprit Smith, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Land ecosystems currently play a key role in mitigating climate change. The more carbon dioxide (CO2) plants and trees absorb during photosynthesis, the process they use to make food, the less CO2 remains trapped in the atmosphere, where it can cause temperatures to rise. But scientists have identified an unsettling trend – as levels of CO2 in the atmosphere increase, 86% of land ecosystems globally are becoming progressively less efficient at absorbing it. Because CO2 is a main \"ingredient\" that plants need to grow, elevated concentrations of it cause an increase in photosynthesis, and consequently, plant growth – a phenomenon aptly referred to as the CO2 fertilization effect, or CFE. CFE is considered a key factor in the response of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2 as well as an important mechanism for removing this potent greenhouse gas from our atmosphere – but that may be changing. For a new study published Dec. 10 in Science, researchers analyzed multiple field, satellite-derived and model-based datasets to better understand what effect increasing levels of CO2 may be having on CFE.

The rest is converted to heat, which is radiated uselessly off of your engine or blown out of your exhaust pipe. Researchers at JPL are helping automakers develop technology to capture and recover that wasted energy. By Bob Silberg,Jet Propulsion Laboratory Next time you’re pumping gasoline into your car or truck, think about this: Three-quarters of the energy in that pricey petroleum will be wasted. Only about 25 percent of the energy in every gallon of gasoline you buy actually helps your vehicle to run. The rest is converted to heat, which is radiated uselessly off of your engine or blown out of your exhaust pipe. What if you could recover some of that wasted energy? You’d need less gas, which would not only save money, but also reduce carbon emissions and the need for foreign sources of fuel. But is there a practical way to turn a car’s heat into useful energy? For a solution to this down-to-earth problem, automakers are looking to the space program. Two major brands so far have struck deals with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to help them develop devices that will turn some of that waste heat into electricity. The extra juice could power a car’s electrical equipment, from windshield wipers to music systems, thereby freeing up gasoline energy to drive the power train. In the case of an electric or hybrid vehicle, this newfound electricity could contribute directly to propulsion. NASA has been using heat-to-electricity technology for decades to power spacecraft touring the outer planets, where the distance from the sun makes solar panels inadequate. The technology relies on thermoelectric (TE) materials—special kinds of semiconductors that generate an electric current when one end is kept hotter than the other end. The greater the temperature difference, the more electricity is produced. The Cassini spacecraft currently exploring Saturn and its moons uses a thermoelectric generator. “Curiosity,” the new rover headed for Mars, will use one too, enabling it to continue its work even during the Martian nights and winters. Such devices have logged millions of hours of operation in space without a single thermoelectric-related failure, according to Thierry Caillat, a principal staff member of the JPL Thermal Energy Conversion Technologies group. “JPL has over 30 years of experience in high-temperature thermoelectric materials,” Caillat said. “We are expert in metallization and integrating thermoelectric materials into high-temperature TE devices.” Caillat’s team is adapting some of the new thermoelectric materials that were developed at JPL into generators that are specifically designed for automotive applications. Where space-based TE generators use plutonium as the heat source, their automotive counterparts use a vehicle’s engine or exhaust pipe. Caillat estimates that a generator using existing TE materials can improve a car’s gas mileage by about 5 percent. The goal is 10 percent. In some ways, designing for trips to the grocery store is even more challenging than designing for trips to infinity and beyond. Once activated, TE generators in space tend to remain at the same temperature throughout their lifespans. Cars, on the other hand, are repeatedly turned on and off. In winter, the hot end of an automotive TE device can go from subfreezing temperatures to 600 degrees C (about 1,100 degrees F) and back in a relatively short amount of time, day after day. This “thermal cycling” is very hard on the TE materials. “Some of these cycles can be pretty fast and pretty violent,” Caillat said. “That can induce mechanical stress and generate cracks in the thermoelectric materials.” In principle, the earthly arenas in which TE generators harness wasted energy could reach beyond the automotive industry. “Anything that has waste heat could be a potential field of application for thermoelectric generators,” Caillat said. “For example, the smelting industry—they have got furnaces at very high temperature. The big question in all of these applications is really the cost; can we drive down the cost?” If so, the cost of driving will drop as well—in terms of both money and impact on the environment. This technology is already being employed to cool the seats in some higher-end cars, and may lead to a very reliable solid-state air conditioning system that needs no refrigerant. It can also be used to keep batteries cooler, enabling them to work longer and more reliably. This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

This is the first study to assess the effects of microgravity on cells of a biofuel plant. \"As the search for alternate energy sources has become a top priority, the results from this study could add value for commercialization of a new product,” said Wagner Vendrame, principal investigator for the experiment at the University of Florida in Homestead. \"Our goal is to verify if microgravity will induce any significant changes in the cells that could affect plant growth and development back on Earth.\" Launched on space shuttle Endeavour’s STS-130 mission in February",

Plastic bags with semi-permeable membranes allow fresh water to flow out into the ocean, while retaining the algae and nutrients. Photo Credit: Penny Slinger Hills NASA scientists have proposed an ingenious and remarkably resourceful process to produce \"clean energy\" biofuels, that cleans waste water, removes carbon dioxide from the air, retains important nutrients, and does not compete with agriculture for land or freshwater. When astronauts go into space, they must bring everything they need to survive. Living quarters on a spaceship require careful planning and management of limited resources, which is what inspired the project called “Sustainable Energy for Spaceship Earth.” It is a process that produces \"clean energy\" biofuels very efficiently and very resourcefully. Oil producing algae Oil producing algae \"The reason why algae are so interesting is because some of them produce lots of oil,\" said Jonathan Trent, the lead research scientist on the Spaceship Earth project at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. “In fact, most of the oil we are now getting out of the ground comes from algae that lived millions of years ago. Algae are still the best source of oil we know.\" Algae are similar to other plants in that they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, and use phosphates, nitrogen, and trace elements to grow and flourish. Unlike many plants, they produce fatty, lipid cells loaded with oil that can be used as fuel. Land plants currently used to produce biodiesel and other fuels include soy, canola, and palm trees. For the sake of comparison, soy beans produce about 50 gallons of oil per acre per year; canola produces about 160 gallons per acre per year, and palms about 600 gallons per acre per year. But some types of algae can produce at least 2,000 gallons of oil per acre per year. The basic problem is growing enough algae to meet our country's enormous energy-consumption demands. Although algae live in water, land-based methods are used to grow algae. Two land-based methods used today are open ponds and closed bioreactors. Open ponds are shallow channels filled with freshwater or seawater, depending on the kind of algae that is grown. The water is circulated with paddle wheels to keep the algae suspended and the pond aerated. They are inexpensive to build and work well to grow algae, but have the inevitable problem of water evaporation. To prevent the ponds from drying out or becoming too salty, conditions that kill the algae, an endless supply of freshwater is needed to replenish the evaporating water. When closed bioreactors are used to grow algae, water evaporation is no longer the biggest problem for algae's mass-production. Bioreactors, enclosed hardware systems made of clear plastic or glass, present their own problems. They can be computer-controlled and monitored around the clock for a more bountiful supply of algae. However, storing water on land and controlling its temperature are the big problems, making them prohibitively expensive to build and operate. In addition, both systems require a lot of land. Plastic bags and waste water Plastic bags and waste water \"The inspiration I had was to use offshore membrane enclosures to grow algae. We're going to deploy a large plastic bag in the ocean, and fill it with sewage. The algae use sewage to grow, and in the process of growing they clean up the sewage,\" said Trent. Waste water produces biomass, oil, and oxygen. It is a simple, but elegant concept. The bag will be made of semi-permeable membranes that allow fresh water to flow out into the ocean, while retaining the algae and nutrients. The membranes are called “forward-osmosis membranes.” NASA is testing these membranes for recycling dirty water on future long-duration space missions. They are normal membranes that allow the water to run one way. With salt water on the outside and fresh water on the inside, the membrane prevents the salt from diluting the fresh water. It’s a natural process, where large amounts of fresh water flow into the sea. Floating on the ocean's surface, the inexpensive plastic bags will be collecting solar energy as the algae inside produce oxygen by photosynthesis. The algae will feed on the nutrients in the sewage, growing rich, fatty cells. Through osmosis, the bag will absorb carbon dioxide from the air, and release oxygen and fresh water. The temperature will be controlled by the heat capacity of the ocean, and the ocean's waves will keep the system mixed and active. When the process is completed, biofuels will be made and sewage will be processed. For the first time, harmful sewage will no longer be dumped into the ocean. The algae and nutrients will be contained and collected in a bag. Not only will oil be produced, but nutrients will no longer be lost to the sea. According to Trent, the system ideally is fail proof. Even if the bag leaks, it won’t contaminate the local environment. The enclosed fresh water algae will die in the ocean. The bags are expected to last two years, and will be recycled afterwards. The plastic material may be used as plastic mulch, or possibly as a solid amendment in fields to retain moisture. “We have to remember,” Trent said, quoting Marshall McLuhan: “we are not passengers on spaceship Earth, we are the crew.” This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "4 min read Our oceans and the complex \"conveyer belt\" system of currents that connects them play an important role in regulating global climate. The oceans store heat from the Sun, and ocean currents transport that heat from the tropics to the poles. They release the heat and moisture into the air, which moderates climate nearby. But what happens if part of that conveyer belt jams? It's not a theoretical question. Scientists have observed that a major ocean current called the Indonesia Throughflow, which provides the only tropical connection between the Pacific and Indian oceans, slows dramatically near the surface during the Northwest Asia monsoon season - usually December through March. And a team of scientists, led by Tong Lee of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has figured out why. \"We have found that this current, which is a very important element of the global ocean current system, is significantly affected by local precipitation,\" Lee said. \"It is fairly common knowledge that winds drive ocean currents. In this case, however, the precipitation is actually a dominant factor during the monsoon season.\" It's a discovery that will improve our understanding of complex Earth processes. During this season, about 10 feet (3 meters) of rain fall over the maritime continent, a region of Southeast Asia between the Indian and Pacific oceans through which the Indonesia Throughflow current travels. This influx of local rain reduces the pressure force that drives the current through the region. How does that work? Gravity causes water to travel \"downhill\" from areas of relatively higher sea level toward areas of lower sea level unless opposed by another force. In the tropical Pacific, trade winds also influence the flow of water. They blow from east to west, causing ocean currents to transport large amounts of water from the U.S. westward toward Asia. This raises the sea level on the Asian side of the Pacific Ocean and provides enough force to keep the Indonesia Throughflow moving, connecting the two oceans. However, the influx of rain during monsoon season temporarily but significantly raises the local sea level in the Indonesian seas that sit between the Pacific and Indian oceans enough to essentially eliminate the downhill flow. Think of it like a ball rolling freely downhill versus a ball on a flat surface, which has little momentum to move forward. Although the slowing of this current is primarily seasonal, it still affects the amount of heat transported from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean, which can change regional climate in Southeast Asia. \"The increase in local sea level due to the seasonal freshening of seawater pushes against the normally higher sea level from the Pacific Ocean,\" said Lee. \"It restricts the surface flow of this current during the monsoon season, which prevents a lot of the heat normally carried by the current from making its way to the Indian Ocean.\" Furthermore, since all of these currents are connected globally, less warm water is transported into the Indian Ocean, and in turn, less warm water is transported from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean over the long term. So the Indonesia Throughflow - one element of a much larger system - can have a significant effect thousands of miles away from where it flows. The results of this study will help to improve climate models by enabling scientists to factor in these effects and changes. Titled \"Maritime Continent water cycle regulates low-latitude chokepoint of global ocean circulation,\" the study was recently published in Nature. NASA satellite data, particularly ocean salinity measurements from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, were instrumental in these findings. Although SMAP was designed primarily to measure soil moisture, its radiometer is also able to measure sea surface salinity. The results of this paper demonstrate the utility of SMAP salinity data in exploring changes in the water cycle, sea level, ocean circulation and climate.

The rotor's rotational speed is increased through a gearbox, which drives a high-pressure fluid pump. The high-pressure fluid would be transported though flexible tubes to a larger pipe and then to an efficient, onshore hydroelectric power plant. NASA researchers who developed a new way to power robotic underwater vehicles believe a spin-off technology could help convert ocean energy into electrical energy on a much larger scale. The researchers hope that clean, renewable energy produced from the motion of the ocean and rivers could potentially meet an important part of the world's demand for electricity. A major advantage of this design is that it eliminates all submerged electrical components, which are subject to corrosion. - JPL Engineer Jack Jones Many different methods already exist for using moving water to create power. Hydroelectric plants, for example, are among the most established and least expensive sources of electricity. They benefit from the large hydrostatic pressure difference between the water surface behind the dam and the turbines that can be harnessed to produce power. But the power that can be produced in this manner is limited, because most of the suitable rivers already have hydroelectric dams. Other technologies have been designed -- and are being developed -- to turn the energy of ocean currents, tides, and flowing rivers into another kind of power, called hydrokinetic energy. Many of these hydrokinetic energy systems use underwater turbines, similar to those in wind farms. Ocean currents or tides turn the turbines, which generate electricity that can be transferred by cable to shore. Jack Jones, an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Yi Chao, a JPL scientist, have designed a new kind of underwater hydrokinetic energy system. It uses water motion to generate a high-pressure liquid rather than electricity. That liquid is then transported to shore and used to produce electricity on land. Caltech, which operates JPL for NASA, holds the patent on this innovative energy technology. The JPL/Caltech hydrokinetic energy system is a spin-off from a research project to find a new way to power robotic underwater vehicles. Most robotic underwater vehicles run on batteries and have to be recovered by ship to have their batteries recharged or replaced. In this project, initiated by Pat Beauchamp of JPL's Center for In Situ Exploration and Sample Return, Jones was asked to develop a way to use temperature differences in the ocean to power submersibles. He had previously developed thermally controlled balloons for Venus, Mars and Titan. Jones was teamed up with Chao, who uses underwater gliders in his oceanographic research. \"I saw we could extend the lives of these vehicles significantly by harvesting energy from the ocean environment,\" Chao says. Jones and Chao designed a system that takes advantages of changes in ocean temperature to create a high-pressure fluid that can be used to generate power. \"The trick was to find a special substance known as a phase change material that changes from a solid to a liquid as the temperature in the environment changes from cold to warm,\" Chao says. \"When the material melts, it expands, compressing a central tube in which another liquid is stored. This liquid, now under high pressure, is used to generate electricity to charge the battery underwater.\" Working with colleagues from JPL and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego, and funded by the Office of Naval Research, Jones and Chao are developing a prototype underwater vehicle powered by this new energy system. They will conduct field tests in the Pacific Ocean this fall. While they were working on this project, the researchers realized that they could employ the same concept -- using an environmental pump to generate a high-pressure liquid -- to produce electricity from the world's ocean. Going with the flow In the large-scale JPL/Caltech hydrokinetic energy transfer system Jones and Chao propose, ocean tides, currents and waves, as well as river flows, would provide the energy source to create the high-pressure liquid. As the water turns underwater turbine blades, the rotor's rotational speed would be increased through a gearbox, which drives a high-pressure fluid pump. The high-pressure fluid would be transported though flexible tubes to a larger pipe and then to an efficient, onshore hydroelectric power plant. \"If we use fresh water in a closed cycle and recycle the fluid, there would be no direct impact to the ocean or river's ecosystem,\" Chao adds. \"A major advantage of this design,\" says Jones, \"is that it eliminates all submerged electrical components, which are subject to corrosion.\" In addition, other tidal turbine energy systems, such as the one now in operation in Manhattan's East River, transfer the power generated by the turbines to the surface through buried electrical cables. These are expensive, hard to maintain, and can be dangerous, Jones says. Similar issues exist with two other types of hydrokinetic systems in use in the United Kingdom and planned for South Korea. \"The JPL/Caltech hydrokinetic energy transfer system combines a simple, corrosion-resistant subsurface design with the least expensive electrical energy generation system onshore,\" says Jones. \"Our proposed system has another advantage,\" he says. \"The pressurized hydraulic energy can be stored in an elevated onshore reservoir and can be used to generate electricity when it is needed to respond to energy-demand. Most environmentally friendly energy systems produce power intermittently.\" \"This type of hydraulic energy transfer system is potentially applicable to many types of hydrokinetic energy from rivers, ocean waves, tides and currents,\" Chao says. Scientists can use state-of-the-art computer models of winds, river flows, ocean currents and tides to determine any location's potential for energy production, he adds. They can also predict how much energy could be produced in the future to help in planning energy use and storage. \"As with all such technologies, the ultimate arbiter is the end result of systems-engineering studies, overall efficiency, and costs in terms of dollars per output watt capacity and cents per kilowatt-hour produced,\" says Paul Dimotakis, JPL's chief technologist. \"Such studies and preliminary development efforts also need to be performed for the JPL/Caltech hydrokinetic energy systems, and if these are promising, then the next phase in development can be undertaken.\" Jones and Chao will be presenting a paper on the JPL/Caltech hydrokinetic energy transfer system at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering this summer in Honolulu, Hawaii.

After all, it’s just there. Gazing into the sky during the day, it’s tough to get a handle on what’s happening up there. Our atmosphere seems tantalizingly close and yet mysteriously distant. The life-sustaining air we breathe envelops our planet like a pale-blue security blanket, clinging to us by the force of gravity. We see birds, planes, an ever-changing patchwork of clouds and, in some places, air pollution. Farther out, our Moon glows down on us and a blazing Sun hangs in the sky. From our Earth-bound perspective, it’s hard to tell where our atmosphere ends and space begins. (Our atmosphere is like a multi-layered cake.) Then darkness falls, and through the murky blackness, a portal opens to the heavens, punctuated only by the light of the Moon, stars and cosmos. The descent of night makes sizing up our atmosphere an even more baffling proposition. It’s only when we view Earth from the unique vantage point of space that the true nature of our atmosphere becomes apparent. From Earth orbit, we gain a new window into our planet. Beneath us, the very edge of the atmosphere — known as Earth’s “limb” — appears as a glowing halo of colors; a luminescent layer cake that gradually fades into the blackness of space. And suddenly our atmosphere, which seemed so vast and mysterious from the ground, appears shockingly thin, even fragile. So thought retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly.

The slow evolution of clean-energy solutions is about to kick into high gear, if Sossina M. Haile has anything to say about it. As a fuel cell researcher at the California Institute of Technology and a founding member of the company Superprotonic Inc., she hopes to make this “technology of the future” practical for today’s applications. Size comparison of a dime and a single fuel cell - the device pictured at the top of the page is a stack of these individual cells. Current fuel cell technology is hamstrung by impracticality. The most efficient and powerful fuel cells need large amounts of heat and space, whereas those suitable for smaller scale operation require lots of precious, expensive platinum. “If we converted every car in the U.S. to fuel cells, we’d need more platinum than there is in the proven reserves,” Haile says. Haile’s research, which initially began several years ago with fuel cell researchers at JPL, has led to breakthroughs in more “consumer-ready” fuel cell technology. She’s developed fuel cell systems that strike a balance between power and manageability –- perfect, she says, for standalone residential generators. Her team has worked hard to reduce the amount of platinum needed for each system. Haile's team has also taken on one of the biggest roadblocks to widespread fuel cell use -- their reliance on hydrogen as a primary fuel. Hydrogen requires lots of energy to extract and it’s difficult to store and distribute. Zongping Shao, who is now a professor at Nanjing College of Chemistry in China, listens to an MP3 player being powered by two fuel cells. In fact, Haile thinks that the verdict is still out on whether hydrogen “makes sense” as the fuel of the future. “When most people hear ‘fuel cells,’ they think hydrogen,” says Haile. “That’s a common misperception -- fuel cells aren’t necessarily restricted to hydrogen.” Haile's team has focused on developing fuel cells that can run on more traditional fuels, like ethanol or biomass, while also solving many of the problems of conventional hydrogen fuel cells. Fuel cells that use carbon-based fuels still produce carbon emissions, but at a much lower rate than their internal-combustion counterparts. Because fuel cells extract energy from electrochemical reactions instead of burning their fuel, they are much more efficient and environmentally friendly. “It’s a unique middle ground,” explains Haile -- one she believes will speed the integration of these new technologies into the current energy infrastructure. For Haile, the incentive to design practical, unconventional fuel cells is simple: “Science should be in the service of society.” She thinks that fuel cells that can use renewable energy resources like biomass will help end what she calls she calls “drawing from the bank” -- using fossil fuels as a source of energy. “There’s scientific proof that CO2 concentrations have been rising for decades to levels not felt on the Earth in millenia,” Haile says. “We need to have a diverse approach to solving the problem before it’s too late.” Written by Joshua Rodriguez/Global Climate Change Inside a fuel cell, the fuel is separated from oxygen by a thin membrane called an electrolyte. The electrolyte membrane only allows protons, or charged hydrogen atoms, to pass through it. In order for the fuel (hydrogen in this example) to get the oxygen, it has to drop off its electrons at the anode and become converted to protons. The protons travel through the membrane and react with oxygen and electrons at the cathode. To get to the cathode, the electrons have to travel through an exterior circuit, producing an electrical current. Haile's Innovation Haile’s research has resulted in a type of electrolyte that works with carbon-based fuels, uses less expensive platinum, and works at a manageable temperatures. The technology has application far beyond just automobiles -- power plants, portable generators, and even cell phones could eventually be powered by this technology.

    "content": "7 min read By Kate Ramsayer,NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Less than three months into its mission, NASA’s Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, or ICESat-2, is already exceeding scientists’ expectations. The satellite is measuring the height of sea ice to within an inch, tracing the terrain of previously unmapped Antarctic valleys, surveying remote ice sheets, and peering through forest canopies and shallow coastal waters. With each pass of the ICESat-2 satellite, the mission is adding to data sets tracking Earth’s rapidly changing ice. Researchers are ready to use the information to study sea level rise resulting from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and to improve sea ice and climate forecasts. “ICESat-2 is going to be a fantastic tool for research and discovery, both for cryospheric sciences and other disciplines,” said Tom Neumann, ICESat-2 project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Neumann and others with ICESat-2’s science team shared the first look at the satellite’s findings at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting on Tuesday in Washington, D.C. In topographic maps of Transantarctic Mountains, which divide East and West Antarctica, there are places where other satellites just can’t see. Some instruments don’t orbit that far south, while others pick up only large features or the highest points, and so miss minor peaks and valleys. With an early pass of ICESat-2, scientists started to fill in those details. “It’s spectacular terrain,” said Benjamin Smith, a glaciologist with the University of Washington, Seattle, and member of the ICESat-2 science team. “We’re able to measure slopes that are steeper than 45 degrees, and maybe even more, all through this mountain range.” As ICESat-2 orbits over the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the photon returns reflect from the surface and show high ice plateaus, crevasses in the ice 65 feet (20 meters) deep, and the sharp edges of ice shelves dropping into the ocean. These first measurements can help fill in the gaps of Antarctic maps, Smith said, but the key science of the ICESat-2 mission is yet to come. As researchers refine knowledge of where the instrument is pointing, they can start to measure the rise or fall of ice sheets and glaciers. “Very soon, we’ll have measurements that we can compare to older measurements of surface elevation,” Smith said. “And after the satellite’s been up for a year, we’ll start to be able to watch the ice sheets change over the seasons.” When sea ice first forms on polar oceans, before snow falls on it and wind smashes it into other floes, it is thin, flat and smooth. This makes it a good place to test out how precise ICESat-2 data are, since long stretches should all be nearly the same height, said Ron Kwok, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. So far? “The data’s spectacular,” Kwok said. “The fresh ice is totally flat to within a couple centimeters.” The first months of ICESat-2 data collected over Arctic and Antarctic sea ice reveal thin ice, thick ice, and features such as ice ridges. Areas of open water in the cracks between the ice floes, called leads, stand out in the data because of the difference in reflectivity between ice and water. By comparing the height of that water surface in the leads with the height of the ice, scientists are estimating ice freeboard and thickness. With the high precision of ICESat-2, plus the satellite’s six beams taking data simultaneously, researchers will have an unprecedented understanding of the thickness of sea ice, which will be used to help improve climate modeling and forecasts. Plus, the ability to identify newly formed, thin ice will help researchers track the seasonal changes in remote polar regions, and understand the processes that drive those processes. The ice-thickness data will also help scientists improve computer models of how sea ice responds to Arctic warming, as well as forecasts of sea ice cover. “We’ll have much higher resolution of where it’s ice and where it’s water in the marginal ice zones, where the compact ice cover meets the ocean, during melt and freeze-up,” Kwok said. “That’s going to be new science to think about. “ ICESat-2 is always on, taking measurements not only at the poles but also in the tropical and temperate latitudes, and what it can see has already surprised researchers. “We were all taken aback seeing the amazing detail from ICESat-2, thanks to its detection technology,” said Lori Magruder, a research scientist at the University of Texas and the ICESat-2 science team lead. “On every surface, there was some amazing feature that we weren’t used to seeing with the first ICESat.” For example, photons returning from over the ocean trace individual waves. In clear coastal areas, the bathymetry is visible, sometimes as deep as 80 feet (25 meters), which could help with research, including storm surge modeling, Magruder said. And as ICESat-2 orbits over forests, it can distinguish not only the tops of trees but also the inner canopies and the forest floor. While the team was unsure how clear the terrain would be under dense canopies like those found in tropical rainforests, the data turned out even better than expected. By measuring tree heights globally, the ICESat-2 mission will be able to improve estimates of how much carbon is stored in forests. As the ICESat-2 science team was analyzing the first sets of data, colleagues with NASA’s Operation IceBridge were collecting data in aircraft over Antarctica—flying over the same paths that the satellite was orbiting. Over vast plains of rippling ice, craggy peaks poking through the ice sheet, and lines of crevasses marching down glaciers, the airborne campaign measured surface elevation with the Airborne Topographic Mapper’s laser altimeters, snow and ice thickness with radars, and sub-ice-shelf bathymetry with a gravimeter. For a decade, IceBridge has been surveying the region, but this fall they were also gathering data to help check the accuracy of ICESat-2. In three separate flights, IceBridge surveyed the flat plateau along the 88-degree-south latitude line where all ICESat-2 orbits converge. Other flights tracked across glaciers, ice streams and mountains along individual satellite paths—at times right as the satellite passed overhead. To measure sea ice, the IceBridge team flew briefly at 500 feet to measure wind speed, calculated how far the ice had moved since ICESat-2 measured it, and then adjusted the flight path to survey the same patch of ice. “Almost every flight has ICESat-2 tracks incorporated into it,” said Joseph MacGregor, IceBridge project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. “We fly over fast-changing outlet glaciers, the slower-changing interior, and uncommon surfaces that are interesting to ICESat-2. The primary goal for IceBridge is to bridge the gap between ICESat and ICESat-2, so it’s very rewarding to know that we’re completing that process.” The first ICESat satellite operated between",

Through its Rapid Response and Novel Research in Earth Science (RRNES) initiative, the agency is providing funding for selected, rapid-turnaround projects that make innovative use of satellite data and other NASA resources to address the different environmental, economic and societal impacts of the pandemic. NASA announced last month the first RRNES projects and is continuing to evaluate new project proposals. The agency recently funded the following four RRNES projects: The drastic reduction of passenger vehicles on the roads has resulted in a drop in air pollution, particularly nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in many urban areas. However, according to Susan Anenberg and Dan Goldberg from George Washington University, initial analysis of satellite data indicates that the decrease in NO2 concentrations across cities globally during their lockdown periods has been inconsistent. Cities in China and Italy, for example, seem to show a much greater and more abrupt decline in this type of pollution than many cities in the U.S. \"Our project will link satellite remote sensing with weather, traffic counts, and other data to shed light on why we are seeing these inconsistent effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality in different cities around the world,\" said Goldberg. Data like this can greatly benefit public health both as we navigate the current pandemic and in the future. \"Since air pollution may be a risk factor for increased severity of COVID-19 outcomes, accurate information about air pollution levels during the COVID-19 crisis is critical to protect public health,\" Anenberg said. \"Our project will also improve public health in the long-term by advancing our understanding of how transportation policies can be designed to improve air quality most effectively and efficiently.\" Although satellites have observed a global decrease in some types of air pollution, including nitrogen dioxide, it remains to be seen how long the reduction in harmful emissions will last and what effects these changes will have on the chemistry of the atmosphere in the future. University at Buffalo scientist Kang Sun is developing a process that will give scientists and stakeholders a way to efficiently monitor both. \"Using a new data-driven framework that combines satellite and meteorological data, we will take NASA satellite assets one step further to quantify the reduction in emissions and its impact on air quality chemistry,\" said Sun. For now, he plans to focus his research on three regions, each at different phases of the pandemic and that have adhered to different regulations and policies in an effort to control it. \"We will focus on nitrogen oxides in the polluted regions of Jianghan Plain (which includes Wuhan) in China, Po Valley in Italy, and southern California in the U.S.,\" he said. \"However, the established framework can be quickly applied to other regions, time periods, and trace gases with rapid sharing of the results, algorithm, and data generated by this project.” What goes into our air can also impact other parts of the Earth system, like water quality. City University of New York scientists Maria Tzortziou and Brice Grunert are researching this connection to determine what impact the COVID-19-related declines in air pollution may have on coastal water quality in Long Island Sound, near New York City. \"Socioeconomic policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a dramatic decline in atmospheric nitrogen pollution across the globe. Yet, the impacts on atmospherically deposited nitrogen and resulting changes in coastal aquatic ecology remain unknown,\" said Tzortziou. In general, an overabundance of nitrogen and other chemicals and nutrients in the water can cause excessive algae growth. When the algae decompose, a process that consumes oxygen, the water is often left without enough oxygen to sustain life. In other words, these processes have a negative effect on water quality. The reduction of atmospheric nitrogen pollution due to society’s response to the pandemic provides scientists with a unique opportunity to investigate air pollution's influence on water quality. \"Using new measurements from ground-based and satellite platforms to capture changes in both atmospheric and water quality conditions, this project will help address a gap in our fundamental understanding of air-water exchange of nutrients and pollutants, and how this impacts and is impacted by environmental regulations, socioeconomic policy responses and decision making,\" said Tzortziou. In addition to environmental changes, measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 have led to a substantial shift in human activity and movement around the globe. A team of researchers led by Miguel Román, program director at Universities Space Research Association and a principal investigator of NASA's Black Marble science team, is using satellite nighttime light data to help assess the social and economic impacts of this crisis locally to globally, and the effectiveness of containment actions, such as stay-at-home orders, taken to control the spread of the virus. \"Our research team has been analyzing images of Earth at night to decipher patterns of energy use, transportation, migration, and other economic and social activities,\" Román said. \"Currently, there are minimal data about how different containment strategies have affected local businesses and neighborhoods, and how companies and residents are responding to preventative measures aimed at containment.\" The research team will use NASA's Black Marble – a product suite that provides daily satellite-derived nighttime light data – along with population, urban infrastructure, and local pandemic response information to develop COVID-19-specific maps and data products capable of tracking these responses from the street level to the global level in near-real-time. \"By tracking responses at fine spatial scales – at the sub-neighborhood level, for example – using NASA’s Black Marble product, we seek to improve understanding of how responses to containment strategies have varied within cities and across metropolitan areas with different levels of urbanization and regulation,\" said Román. This information can inform stakeholders responsible for monitoring the extent, duration, and recovery from this and future outbreaks and disasters.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Photo of the Rink glacier between rocky cliffs where it meets the sea. Credit: NASA By Lara Streiff, NASA's Earth Science News Team As glaciers flow outward from the Greenland Ice Sheet, what lies beneath them offers clues to their role in future ice thinning and sea-level rise contribution. Outlet glaciers are rivers of ice flowing within the cracks of the bedrock and draining into the surrounding sea. They retreat and start to thin as climate warms, and this thinning works its way toward the center of the ice sheet. Now, by looking at the bed topography beneath the ice, scientists have a better understanding of which glaciers could have a significant impact on the Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to sea-level rise in coming years. They found that some glaciers flowing over gentler slopes could have a greater impact than previously thought. The gentle slopes allow thinning to spread from the edge of the ice sheet far into the interior, whereas glaciers with steep drops in their bed topographies limit how far into the interior thinning can spread. The research, which was published December 11th in Geophysical Research Letters, analyzed 141 outlet glaciers on the Greenland Ice Sheet to predict how far into the interior thinning may spread along their flow lines, starting from the ocean edge. “What we discovered is some glaciers flow over these steep drops in the bed, and some don’t,” said lead author Denis Felikson with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA). “For the glaciers that do have that steep drop in the bed, thinning can’t make its way past those drops.” Borrowing a term from geomorphology – the study of Earth’s physical features – they coined these steep drop features “knickpoints.” When a river flows over a knickpoint, it often results in a waterfall or a lake. But for glaciers, steep is a relative term which in reality translates to just about three degrees of incline. “It’s not like the ice is going over a cliff,” said Felikson. “But in terms of glacier dynamics, they are very steep – an order of magnitude more steep than a typical bed that the ice flows over.” The researchers were able to identify these “steep” changes in topography using digital elevation models of the ice sheet bed and surface topography. Surface topography came from the Greenland Ice Mapping Project, created using NASA’s Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument that flies aboard NASA’s Terra satellite, in conjunction with data from NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission. The bed topography digital elevation model, known as the BedMachine data set, is a high-resolution model of the bed beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet, created using data from NASA’s Operation IceBridge airborne surveys of polar ice. “This bed topography data set was critical to us doing our work,” Felikson said. “And it is thanks to NASA remote sensing, namely the Operation IceBridge surveys, that we were able to do this.” Using the remote sensing data, scientists were able to compare topography measures to produce a single metric along a glacier’s flow line. This helped them identify a break point between the upstream and downstream parts of the glacial ice. Ice below the knickpoint is susceptible to thinning from the glacier’s edge. But the thinning does not extend beyond this point upstream, so the interior of the ice sheet is not impacted. Of all the glaciers observed, a majority (65%) had discernable knickpoints. Especially steep knickpoints are prevalent in the more mountainous regions of Greenland, where several of the biggest and fastest moving glaciers also show knickpoints that are relatively close to the coast. By sheer size alone these glaciers could contribute significantly to ice sheet thinning and melt, but because their knickpoints are near the coast, thinning is not expected to spread far inland. However, glaciers that flow through gentle topography are found to either have gradual knickpoints, or no knickpoint at all. Such glaciers are of interest, and concern, because even those that are smaller in size have the potential to let thinning expand hundreds of kilometers inland, eroding the heart of the ice sheet. “They could be impactful in terms of sea level rise, not because they are big and deep, but because they have access to more ice that they can eat away,” said Felikson. “It will take them a lot longer to respond, but over the long term they could end up contributing just as much to sea level rise, maybe, as the big glaciers.” Over the gentle topography of the northwest coast of Greenland, nine of twelve neighboring glaciers are predicted to thin more than 250 km (155.3 miles) into the interior of the ice sheet, over a ∼140-km (86.9 mile) wide region. The northwest sector of the ice sheet is also the only region experiencing an ongoing increase in ice discharge over the last couple decades, and Felikson predicts that it will continue to do so given the characteristics of these glaciers. This work was started at the University of Texas as part of Felikson’s dissertation and has continued throughout his time at NASA Goddard. The origins of knickpoints and their implications for long-term thinning, as well as Greenland’s overall contribution to sea level rise, remain the basis for future research.

    "content": "4 min read Using satellite observations of Antarctica to search for penguin guano (poo) may not sound like the most exciting research, but it’s providing scientists with unique insights on the Adélie penguin’s diet and the effect that changes in that diet might have on the Adélie’s future. Adélie penguin populations have declined significantly in some areas even as the global population increases. Scientists want to understand why these changes have occurred since they may indicate a change in the Southern Ocean environment or the availability of penguin prey. A NASA-funded team recently unlocked some long-standing secrets about the Adélie penguin—a species that can provide an early-warning of threats to Antarctica’s delicate ecosystem. Casey Youngflesh, a graduate student from Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, along with Stony Brook associate professor Heather Lynch, are part of the team that has been tapping into Landsat satellite imagery to see if the Adélie’s diet has been changing in response to Antarctica’s changing climate. Over the last few years, Lynch and other scientists have been using satellite data to track the distribution and abundance of penguins across the barren landscape of Antarctica. An initial global survey for Adélie penguins turned up 3.8 million breeding pairs. Landsat imagery has since uncovered several previously unknown massive penguin populations. The satellite images can’t see the penguins individually, but it can detect their presence by the stain left on the ice by their excrement—called guano. “Male and female penguins take turns incubating the nest. The guano left behind builds up in the same areas occupied by the nests themselves,” Lynch explained. “We can use the area of the colony, as defined by the guano stain, to work back to the number of pairs that must have been inside the colony.” Recently, Youngflesh and Lynch have been taking advantage of Landsat’s four decades of consistent imagery of penguin guano to determine what the Adélie are eating, and if that diet has changed over the years. The team presented their new findings today at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington. “First and foremost, I find it incredible that we are now able to determine what penguins are eating from space,” remarked Youngflesh. “Dietary research has been conducted on these penguins in the past, though it was typically limited in scale due to the labor-intensive nature of the work.” Landsat data can detect the color of the penguin guano, which the team used to determine what was on the Adélie’s menu. “Penguin guano ranges from white to pink to dark red,” Lynch said. “White guano is from eating mostly fish; pink and red would be from eating mostly krill.” As part of its research, the team has taken these Landsat views and compared them to the chemical analysis of penguin guano from ground samples. “The team found that Landsat’s views had a surprisingly good relationship between what we can measure spectrally with color and what we can measure in a lab,” Lynch added. After poring over years of Landsat images, the team found—to its surprise—that while Adélie penguin diet did show changes from year to year, no consistent pattern was apparent. “It is interesting that no obvious trend in diet was seen over time, despite changes in the physical environment,” Youngflesh said. “This was a big surprise, since the abundance and distribution of Adélie penguins has changed dramatically over the last 40 years and scientists had hypothesized that a shift in diet may have played a role.” “These findings are important for our understanding of how the Antarctic ecosystem functions and how this system might change in the future,” Youngflesh emphasized. “Given continued changes in the physical environment and a growing krill fishery in the region, changes are likely to be seen both in the availability of penguin prey and penguin populations themselves. Tools such as these will be important for the management of the Antarctic ecosystem, which is often considered among the most pristine areas in the world.” Lynch’s project was funded by NASA’s Applied Sciences Program. Youngflesh’s efforts were funded through a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship award.

Since the temperature of the beach sand that female sea turtles nest in influences the gender of their offspring during incubation, our warming climate may be driving sea turtles into extinction by creating a shortage of males, according to several studies.1 A few degrees make a huge difference. At sand temperatures of 31.1 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit), only female green sea turtles hatch, while at 27.8 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) and below, only males hatch. While the plight of sea turtles is illustrative, it’s a fact that all natural and human systems are sensitive to climate warming in varying degrees.

Credit: NASA/John Sonntag Seven of the regions that dominate global ice mass losses are melting at an accelerated rate, a new study shows, and the quickened melt rate is depleting freshwater resources that millions of people depend on. The impact of melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica on the world's ocean is well documented. But the largest contributors to sea level rise in the 20th century were melting ice caps and glaciers located in seven other regions: Alaska, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Southern Andes, High Mountain Asia, the Russian Arctic, Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard. The five Arctic regions accounted for the greatest share of ice loss. And this ice melt is accelerating, potentially affecting not just coastlines but agriculture and drinking water supplies in communities around the world, according to the study by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory; the University of California, Irvine; and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The study was led by Enrico Ciraci, a UCI graduate student researcher in Earth system science. \"In the Andes Mountains in South America and in High Mountain Asia, glacier melt is a major source of drinking water and irrigation for several hundred million people,\" said study coauthor Isabella Velicogna, a senior scientist at JPL and professor of Earth system science at UCI. \"Stress on this resource could have far-reaching effects on economic activity and political stability.\" The researchers based their work on data from the recently decommissioned U.S.-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) pair of satellites that operated from",

    "content": "5 min read By Maria-José Viñas,NASA’s Earth Science News Team A new NASA-led study has determined that an increase in snowfall accumulation over Antarctica during the 20th century mitigated sea level rise by 0.4 inches. However, Antarctica’s additional ice mass gained from snowfall makes up for just about a third of its current ice loss. “Our findings don’t mean that Antarctica is growing; it’s still losing mass, even with the extra snowfall,” said Brooke Medley, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published in Nature Climate Change on Dec. 10. “What it means, however, is that without these gains, we would have experienced even more sea level rise in the 20th century.” The polar ice sheets grow via snow accumulation and shrink through melting and the production of icebergs. Presently, both ice sheets are imbalanced –losing more ice annually than they are gaining– and their ice loss is estimated to be currently causing about a half of the observed sea level rise. Sea level adjusts to changes in snowfall, which modulates how much water is locked into the ice sheets. Snowfall is very difficult to measure over Antarctica. For starters, there are very few weather stations in the frozen continent, and most of them are installed along the coastline. Secondly, satellites have a hard time measuring snow from space – they basically confuse the snow that’s falling down with the snow that’s already on the ground. Climate models struggle to replicate the total amount of snow that falls over Antarctica each year. So scientists often have to rely on ice cores, cylinders of ice drilled from the ice sheet whose layers store a trove of information; amongst it, how much snow fell in a certain year or decade. But drilling ice cores is logistically challenging, so they are sparse and do not cover the entire continent. Medley and her colleague, British Antarctic Survey’s Elizabeth Thomas, reconstructed how much snow fell over the entire Antarctic continent and nearby islands from",

    "content": "By Elizabeth Goldbaum, NASA's Earth Science Technology Office The yellow-billed cuckoo has soft brown wings, a white belly, a long tail with black and white spots, and is running out of places to live. The cuckoo’s population in its native breeding range in the eastern United States has declined in recent decades due to urbanization, heat waves and other factors. Climate change will likely further reduce its suitable habitat. Although the cuckoo is only one species in a vast world of flora and fauna, its story is not unique. To study and monitor changes in Earth’s biodiversity, or the immense volume of organisms in the world, scientists and citizen scientists record their sightings in the field. At the same time, sensors on the ground and on board satellites and aircraft monitor flora and fauna on a regional to global scale. NASA has funded four projects to create new virtual portals that bring into focus this wealth of biodiversity information to help inform scientists, land managers and decision makers around the world regarding the status and health of terrestrial ecosystems. Each of these projects highlights a different aspect of biodiversity and lets users create easy-to-use maps and other information products to track healthy and vulnerable species as they compete for resources, migrate to safer habitats and adapt to climate change. “Healthy ecosystems and rich biodiversity are fundamental to life on Earth,” said Laura Rogers, a project manager overseeing these efforts at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. “These projects provide critical information to conservationists and policymakers to protect our planet,” Rogers said. If you’ve ever spotted a bright green frog with tiger stripes and wondered, what is that and how can I find more of them, you’re in luck. Tiger-striped leaf frogs are one of many species included in the Map of Life, an interactive virtual database that tracks mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish, insect and plant species around the world. The database can also forecast where species will live in the future and help you determine if their habitats will be protected by laws and regulations. “As the world around us changes rapidly, society, policymakers, businesses and individuals need to make decisions about how we engage with the environment,” said Walter Jetz, a professor at Yale University leading the Map of Life effort. “The data is rapidly increasing,” Jetz said. The Map of Life tool integrates satellite images, museum records, modeling outputs and ground- and water-based information from citizen scientists. For example, the Map of Life gathers information from NASA’s satellites, like Landsat, which is jointly run with the U.S. Geological Survey, and instruments like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. “These satellites are offering global data that we can use and put together with raw data about species occurrences,” Jetz said. The tool aims to help government and nongovernment agencies make informed decisions as they work to conserve and protect our planet’s most vulnerable species. Jennifer McGowan, the Spatial Planning Technical Coordinator for The Nature Conservancy, is responsible for helping her organization prioritize conservation actions. “The Map of Life project provides species-level information,” McGowan said, which is useful for prioritizing which conservation actions to take to protect specific species. “The Map of Life’s species range maps, in particular, are invaluable” to help efforts that balance conservation opportunities across land and ocean habitats in cost-efficient and pragmatic ways, McGowan said. The team also created a mobile app of Map of Life that lets the user explore their surroundings and record their own sightings. It contains information on over 30,000 species around the world. If someone in Houston, Texas wanted to discover local dragonflies, for example, they would open the app, search their location and see a photo and description of Powdered Dancers, or Argia moesta, marble sized insects with long, translucent wings. Both the app and online portal reveal how land use changes, like growing food, cutting trees and building cities, are the primary drivers to shaping biodiversity, Jetz said. If there’s a change in the environment, like a new building over a wetland, there will likely be an impact to biodiversity, like a decrease in dragonflies in a particular area. Researchers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, are also creating a tool to help identify biodiversity changes in North America. In particular, the team, led by Jennifer Swenson and Jim Clark, both professors at Duke, want to know how one species could impact another as it relocates and competes for suitable habitats in a warming world. The team created an interactive web portal that pulls together satellite, airborne and ground-based information, as well as climate projections and ecological forecasts, to track how climate change will impact species and wildlife communities. For instance, the Predicting Biodiversity with a Generalized Joint Attribution Model, or PBGJAM, used information gathered by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and NASA’s remotely sensed Earth data and climate data, among other sources, to reveal where pileated woodpeckers, desert pocket mice and white fir trees, among many species, could migrate under future climate scenarios. “We need to consider who’s living with whom in order to understand larger impacts,” said Swenson. For instance, if the desert pocket mice don’t survive a drought, will their predators find other sources of food, change locations or also perish? The PBGJAM portal aims to explore how a biodiverse community responds to climate change as a whole to more accurately predict the impact on both the individual species and the entire ecosystem. To tackle this, the PBGJAM team built on its powerful Generalized Joint Attribution Model, or the latter part of the acronym, which can pull in different kinds of data for multiple species. For instance, the desert pocket mouse and other mice species are currently concentrated in the southwestern region of the U.S. As they start losing viable habitats with climate change and development, they’ll be forced to move north or east, all the while competing with each other for resources and scurrying from new and old predators. The model considers how many species live in a specific region and how many suitable habitats exist for specific species. The model can also predict how all this could change in the future and how one species’ movements could affect another’s as communities shift. PBGJAM provides a web interface that lowers the barrier of entry for decisionmakers, scientists and any interested individual to get involved. They only need to choose an ecosystem type and then see how it’s shifted, said Adam Wilson, a professor at the University at Buffalo. While PBGJAM takes a broad approach to studying climate change impacts on communities of species, the Advanced Phenological Information System (APIS) focuses on the seasonal dynamics of plant species. More specifically, APIS provides a framework to explore how climate change and other factors can impact phenology, or the study of seasonal life-cycle events such as leafing, flowering, reproduction and migration. APIS includes a constellation of software that relies on millions of field-based observations, near surface cameras and satellite data to explore and synthesize phenology observations from different times and on various spatial scales. The effort was co-led by Jeff Morisette, Chief Scientist for the National Invasive Species Council and Tom Maiersperger, Project Scientist for the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center. The center is part of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System and is located at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earth Resources Observation and Science Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. APIS includes information from MODIS, PhenoCam (a digital camera set up at fixed locations to capture time-lapse images and led by researchers at Northern Arizona University), the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), and NEON. The project also includes Conservation Science Partners who led the development of software to develop near-term phenological forecasts. “When you see a lilac tree blooming, you can say, that’s spring for that one lilac tree,” Morisette said. But what does that mean for the start of the season, as detected by a satellite observation? “APIS provides more comprehensive information over a wider area, across several monitoring networks, and at a range of scales,” Morisette said. “In the context of invasive plants and animals, it is important to understand how species compete with each other and how broader ecosystem dynamics and climate are impacting those species,” Morisette said. “If you only observe at limited temporal and spatial scales, you’re likely to miss something,” he said “Our goal for APIS was to develop technology to make data more accessible and easier to integrate with the data from other observational sources,” Kathy Gerst, a scientist with the USA-NPN, said. Gerst worked with Morisette and others to create APIS. “APIS allows people to bring data together seamlessly,” Gerst said. Ecologists, natural resource managers and climatologists can use APIS to look at the relationship between phenology and climate to see how threatened, endangered and invasive species respond to temperature and rainfall changes, Gerst said. APIS can also help researchers create maps to determine if spring is early in a particular year and study the long-term patterns to see how trends change over time. For example, Gerst and others published a paper that ties spring indices, or models that show the onset of spring, to actual phenological activity, like flowering, in 19 species of trees and shrubs. Other groups using APIS include the U.S. Geological Survey’s Southwest and North Central Climate Adaptation Science Centers. Both centers are examining phenology ties to drought. The U.S. National Park Service is using APIS to better understand vegetation and soils in its Inventory and Monitoring Division, and the Denver Zoo and Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia are using APIS to inform their rangeland management strategy. To help supply APIS, PBGJAM and the Map of Life with robust plant data, a team led by Phil Townsend created the Ecological Spectral Information System (EcoSIS). Townsend is a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Fresh leaves and lush tree tops appear vibrantly green to our eyes because of spectra, or the way they reflect sunlight. Since they absorb every wavelength except for green, we see green. When they begin to change to yellow and red, the leaves are reflecting those colors’ wavelengths. These telltale signs, or changes in spectra, help researchers understand vegetation health. Although there is more spectral data than ever before from airborne, satellite and ground sensors, the data are not always easy to use. The EcoSIS database is a one-stop portal to add, discover and use spectral data. “Spectral information is an indicator for biodiversity,” Natasha Stavros, an engineer working with Townsend at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said. Spectral data can help us understand genetic diversity, Stavros said. Now that EcoSIS is up and operating, the team is developing the Geospatial Spectroscopy Processing Environment on the Cloud (GEOSpec), which is a prototype for a user-focused data system that makes it easier to access and use spectral information. As we send more instruments into space and collect data from aircraft and ground sensors, we end up with a tremendous amount of data. To make that data accessible, GEOSpec operates in a cloud environment so that researchers can access, work and play with data without having to overwhelm their computers’ hardware capabilities. “GEOSpec is not about accessing data; it’s about enabling access to information,” Stavros said. While GEOSpec builds on EcoSIS, the PBGJAM team plans to create tools that incorporate remotely sensed imagery to reveal canopy three-dimensional structure, composition and function. Many birds, mammals and insects make their homes in the vegetation canopy. The Map of Life team plans to create an online database that includes analysis products and visualizations from remotely sensed biodiversity data. These recently-funded tools will continue to lower the barrier of entry for users to interact with biodiversity data The projects were all funded under NASA’s Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) program, which is part of the Earth Science Technology Office at NASA Headquarters. The AIST program funds evolutionary and disruptive projects that meet NASA’s goals to effectively monitor and understand our planet. The program aims to increase access to science data and enable new observation measurements and information products. “AIST projects are defined and driven by science,” said Jacqueline LeMoigne, the AIST program manager. And in return, LeMoigne looks to the projects to help define new science goals and requirements to collect future science measurements from space. “As climate changes, species and communities of species must either adapt or migrate to areas with more favorable conditions,” Rogers said. These AIST projects help predict and track these adaptions and migrations. “In the long run, the program also aims to enable future NASA Earth science missions by discovering and maturing breakthrough computer science, software, and information system technologies,” LeMoigne said.

Researchers analyzed almost 2 million satellite images of the glaciers and found that 94 percent of the differences in flow rates could be explained by changes in ice thickness. For more than a decade, satellite data have documented that the glaciers were thinning as the melt rates on their top surfaces increased. However, \"It has not been entirely clear how these glaciers are responding to this ice loss,\" said the lead author of the new study, Amaury Dehecq of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"The rate at which they will disappear in the future depends on how they adjust to a warming climate.\" Asia's mountain glaciers flow from the cold heights of the world's tallest mountains down to warmer climate zones, where they melt much faster, feeding major rivers such as the Indus and Yangtze. Scientists need to understand what is regulating the glaciers' flow speeds to project how glacial meltwater will contribute to the region's water resources and to sea level rise. Observing the glaciers from ground level is difficult because of their huge geographic expanse and inaccessibility, so the researchers turned to satellite images.

Siegelman is using data from a single tagged southern elephant seal to study small-scale ocean features in a little-known part of the ocean around Antarctica. She is a visiting research student from the University of Western Brittany in Brest, France, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Weighing as much as a midsize pickup truck, southern elephant seals may look sluggish on land, but in the water they're endurance athletes. They spend 9-10 months of each year at sea, swimming thousands of miles and continually diving to depths as great as 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). \"Even when they sleep, they dive - they float down like a leaf,\" Siegelman said. They average about 80 dives a day, spaced less than half a mile apart (700 meters), returning to the surface briefly for air but staying underwater up to two hours at a time. With all this diving, a tagged elephant seal collects data from the entire top layer of the Southern Ocean. Some seals even forage under Antarctic sea ice, where conventional ocean instruments can't go. As global warming changes important ocean currents in ways that affect Antarctic melt rates, any additional data from these dangerous, remote seas is likely to be valuable. That's why Siegelman and her colleagues explore using seal data to better understand the ocean environment. For more than two decades, scientists have been tagging seals on the Kerguelen Islands, a French territory in the Antarctic, to study the animals' behavior. In",

    "content": "10 min read By Alan Buis,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory The twin magnitude 6.4 and 7.1 earthquakes that struck the Ridgecrest area in California’s Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles on July 4 and 5, respectively, were felt by up to 30 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Baja California, resulting in loss of life, injuries, billions in damage and lots of frazzled nerves. While the remote location undoubtedly minimized impacts, the quakes did serve as a wake-up call for complacent Californians that they live in Earthquake Country and need to prepare for the inevitable “Big One” that scientists say is sure to come. They also got people talking about all aspects of earthquakes. There are lots of myths about earthquakes. A common one is that there’s such a thing as “earthquake weather” — certain types of weather conditions that typically precede earthquakes, such as hot and dry, or dry and cloudy. The myth stems from the Greek philosopher Aristotle, who proposed in the 4th century B.C. that earthquakes were caused by trapped winds escaping from subterranean caves. He believed the large amounts of air trapped underground would make weather on Earth’s surface before a quake hot and calm. With the advent of seismology — the study of earthquakes — we now know that most quakes are caused by tectonic processes — forces within the solid Earth that drive changes in the structure of Earth’s crust, primarily the rupture of underground rock masses along faults (linear zones of weakness). We also know that most earthquakes occur far beneath Earth’s surface, well beyond the influence of surface temperatures and conditions. Finally, we know the statistical distribution of earthquakes is approximately equal across all types of weather conditions. Myth busted. In fact, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the only correlation that’s been noted between earthquakes and weather is that large changes in atmospheric pressure caused by major storms like hurricanes have been shown to occasionally trigger what are known as “slow earthquakes,” which release energy over comparatively long periods of time and don’t result in ground shaking like traditional earthquakes do. They note that while such large low-pressure changes could potentially be a contributor to triggering a damaging earthquake, “the numbers are small and are not statistically significant.” But what about climate? Are there any connections between climate phenomena and earthquakes? We asked geophysicist Paul Lundgren of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to do a scientific shakedown on the matter. In order to make any connection between climate and earthquakes, says Lundgren, you first have to determine what kinds of tectonic processes might be related to climate phenomena. Scientists know earthquakes can be triggered or inhibited by changes in the amount of stress on a fault. The largest climate variable that could change fault stress loads is surface water in the form of rain and snow. Lundgren says several studies have supported such correlations. But there’s a catch. “Typically, where we’ve seen these types of correlations is in microseismicity -- tiny earthquakes with magnitudes less than zero, far smaller than humans can feel,” he said. “Those occur quite frequently.” Lundgren cited work by his colleague Jean-Philippe Avouac at Caltech and others, who’ve found a correlation between the amount of microseismicity in the Himalaya and the annual monsoon season. During the summer months, large amounts of precipitation fall on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which encompasses the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. This increases stress loads on Earth’s crust there and decreases levels of microseismicity in the adjacent Himalaya. During the winter dry season, when there’s less water weight on Earth’s crust in the plain, Himalayan microseismicity peaks. Lundgren says it gets much more difficult, however, to make such inferences about larger earthquakes. “We’ve seen that relatively small stress changes due to climate-like forcings can effect microseismicity,” he said. “A lot of small fractures in Earth’s crust are unstable. We see also that tides can cause faint Earth tremors known as microseisms. But the real problem is taking our knowledge of microseismicity and scaling it up to apply it to a big quake, or a quake of any size that people could feel, really.” Climate-related stress changes might or might not promote an earthquake to occur, but we have no way of knowing by how much. “We don’t know when a fault may be at the critical point where a non-tectonic forcing related to a climate process could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, resulting in a sizeable earthquake, and why then and not earlier?” he said. “We’re simply not in a position at this point to say that climate processes could trigger a large quake.” We know seasonal effects can cause changes on faults, but what about less periodic climate phenomena, like a long-term drought? Might they cause changes too? As it turns out, changes in stress loads on Earth’s crust from periods of drought can, in fact, be significant. Research by JPL scientist Donald Argus and others in",

Credit: U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In recent decades, extreme weather events have contributed to increasing loss of lives, human and natural infrastructure and other things of value. Climate change has already begun to exacerbate such losses through more frequent and intense floods, high winds, heat waves, droughts, wildfires and the like, locally and regionally. University of Colorado policy scientist Ron Brunner studies how U.S. communities deal with environmental threats and climate change, from floods in the Midwest to melting permafrost in Alaska. His books include Adaptive Governance and Climate Change and Finding Common Ground: Governance and Natural Resources in the American West. 1. How do local initiatives against climate change compare to international efforts? More than twenty-five years ago, scientists and policy makers framed climate change as a global problem requiring global solutions. We created the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other international institutions to address the problem. Scientists believed that if they reached consensus on the global impacts of climate change, politicians would act to prevent dangerous concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But despite the progress that’s been made in climate science, a lack of political will among national governments has led to policy gridlock. International institutions have made very little difference in reducing net losses and vulnerability to climate change, on both global and national scales. Meanwhile, with little publicity, many local communities have focused independently on their own climate-related problems. Some have significantly reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. Others have decreased their losses and vulnerability to extreme weather events and climate change. In doing so, they have grown their economies and nurtured civic pride, among other community values. Not every community has succeeded, of course. But successful communities serve as working models of how we can reduce or adapt to climate change, which other communities can build upon. 2.

    "content": "4 min read Icy barriers began melting away at the close of the last ice age, easing human passage into North America. Now scientists are piecing together some chilling details: how one corner of Arctic ice retreated over 12,000 years in response to a changing climate. A new set of computer simulations seeks to capture the demise of the ice on the margins of southwestern Greenland. They include a public version that allows you to take control, change environmental conditions and watch the effect on the ice. It’s an early step toward a big idea. Like workers tinkering together mechanical parts, these scientists hope eventually to create a detailed reconstruction of a vanished climate. That could shed new light on ice loss today and in decades to come. Using computer modeling to make predictions of how ice will melt over the coming century “is like going down a dark hallway with a candle,” said Joshua Cuzzone, an ice researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We kind of know where we’re going, but we don’t know the specifics.” Part of the answer involves better understanding of the past. So Cuzzone is lead author of a new paper that seeks to illuminate ice melt since the early Holocene. The coastal terrain of southwestern Greenland offered a nearly ideal platform for Cuzzone and his team to build and test their simulation. The coast is craggy enough, but not too craggy; and the geologic history can be seen clearly in the lines of rubble, called moraines, left behind as glaciers dwindled. These geological details provided the scaffolding for a powerful simulator called the Ice Sheet System Model, or ISSM. ISSM embodies, in a computer, the equations describing the thermal and mechanical physics of ice flowing on bedrock. Such computer models face a tradeoff: if they reproduce small features well – ice streams, marine-terminating glaciers, small bumps in bedrock – they cannot be run for long periods because of the excessive computer load they impose. Earlier models had to choose between detail and long simulations. The amount of small-scale detail a model is able to reproduce is called “model resolution,” and that’s where ISSM departs from previous models. It is designed with resolution that varies spatially: more detail in areas of sharp topography, and less detail (coarser resolution) in others. Imagine draping a flexible mesh over the landscape. It settles and conforms itself to the hills, valleys, ocean inlets and flats. Now imagine this flexible mesh having variable resolution, with threads that are closer together in some regions than in others. The closer threads better adapt to small-scale details of bedrock and ice flow – in other words, the mesh is finer for the craggy, complex parts of the landscape, including fjords, and much coarser for flatter, more featureless sections. The model works in a similar fashion. The “mesh” defines the model’s variable resolution. Start the clock 12,000 years ago and the tiny, gridded spaces formed by the mesh begin to sink at varying rates, tracking contours as the ancient ice melts away. While the main driver of climate change is very different today – human emission of heat-trapping gases versus slow-working, natural processes – the mechanics of ice melt are quite similar. “If we are able to model the retreat history locked within the geological record, it might provide us with a better understanding of how sensitive these ice sheets are,” Cuzzone said. “We’ll be able to infer how anomalous our present-day ice-mass loss is compared to the past 12,000 years.” That, in turn, could help create more precise forecasts of ice melt in the future, and corresponding rates of sea level rise. Adapting the meshes, with high resolution for complex terrain and low resolution for the flats, yielded the best of both worlds: accurate modeling without a heavy burden on computer time. This approach allowed Cuzzone and his team to reproduce the large-scale, well-known retreat of the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet during the Holocene, the geologic period that began some 11,650 years ago. The next step will involve using state-of-the-art reconstructions of past climate, derived from work by paleoclimatologists at the University of Washington, as the environmental setting for the ice model to see how it responds through time. “This will be the constraining model for past ice history across southwestern Greenland,” Cuzzone said. “We’re seeing how well it does. Using the fact that it actually does pretty well, we’ll be able to have confidence in making the claim of comparing past ice-mass loss to current ice-mass loss.” A Q&A with the lead U.S. scientist of the mission, which will track changes in… Climate change is rapidly reshaping a region of the world that’s home to millions of… Explore Earth Science NASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.

    "content": "15 min read By Alan Buis,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory It’s an intriguing premise: what if we could reduce the severity of global climate change by planting hundreds of billions of trees to remove excess carbon from our atmosphere? A recent study published in the journal Science sought to provide answers by estimating the global potential of restoring forested lands as a possible strategy for mitigating climate change. The international research team, led by Jean-Francois Bastin of ETH-Zurich in Switzerland, used direct measurements of forest cover around the world to create a model for estimating Earth’s forest restoration potential. They found Earth’s ecosystems could support another 900 million hectares (2.2 billion acres) of forests, 25 percent more forested area than we have now. By planting more than a half trillion trees, the authors say, we could capture about 205 gigatons of carbon (a gigaton is 1 billion metric tons), reducing atmospheric carbon by about 25 percent. That’s enough to negate about 20 years of human-produced carbon emissions at the current rate, or about half of all carbon emitted by humans since",

    "content": "8 min read By Ellen Gray,NASA's Earth Science News Team Water is so commonplace that we often take it for granted. But too much – or too little of it – makes headlines. Catastrophic flooding in the U.S. Midwest this spring has caused billions of dollars in damage and wreaked havoc with crops, after rain tipped off a mass melting of snow. Seven years of California drought so debilitating that it led to water rationing came to a close after a wet and snowy winter capped off several years of slow rebound and replenished the vital mountain snowpack. Half a world away, drought in eastern Australia so depleted the wheat crop that it had to be imported for the first time in 12 years. In eastern Africa and the Middle East, some of the most severe drought conditions on Earth are contributing to stressed crops across Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Whether concerned with floods, droughts, or the status and quality of water supplies, addressing the water-related needs of humans on Earth starts with knowing where the water is. With unique views from space, NASA is at the forefront of studying and monitoring this most precious resource that is constantly on the move. Researchers use data from satellites, aircraft, and other efforts, to find out where and when water is available around the globe, how much, and how are those patterns changing. They then figure out how to best use that data and get it into the hands of the people who need it most. Over the next few weeks, we'll be exploring areas of NASA research into Earth's fresh water and surveying how those advances help people solve real world problems. NASA and its partners are using satellites to revolutionize our ability to track and understand the flow of fresh water around Earth – whether it is in the atmosphere, at the Earth’s surface, or underground. In the last two decades, freely available NASA datasets have been used for extensive research into the movement, distribution, and interaction of each part of the water cycle worldwide. It’s a complex cycle: Evaporating from warm tropical oceans, fresh water condenses into clouds, circulating on the winds where a portion of it falls as rain or snow. On the ground, fresh water is stored in ice, snow, rivers and lakes. Or, it soaks into the ground, disappearing from view to infiltrate into soils and aquifers. Or, before it disappears from view, it can evaporate back to the atmosphere, where moisture is tightly related to Earth's energy flow, which in turn influences weather patterns that govern fresh water's distribution. “Fresh water is critically important to humans, both in obvious ways and in unseen ways such as moving heat around Earth’s entire climate system,” said Jared Entin, terrestrial hydrology program manager in the Earth Science Division at NASA Headquarters, Washington. “With our current satellites, we are now making great progress in pinning down both the detail needed for local water decisions and the global view essential to better understanding our changing climate.” Researchers funded by NASA have used satellite and airborne data to better inform existing tools for flooding, drought forecasts and famine relief efforts, and for planning and monitoring regional water supplies. These efforts are tackling some of the most pressing needs of people around the world. These efforts are shaped by local geography and specific user needs to ensure they address freshwater data that are most valuable to communities. For this reason, NASA supports a number of water-management applications that are customized to support different regions. For example, NASA's Western Water Applications Office works with various entities in the western U.S., including state governments, tribal nations, and private industries to track the impacts of drought on agriculture and general water supplies. Abroad, NASA partners with the U.S. Agency for International Development through the SERVIR program to provide satellite data, computing tools, and training to local partners that improve local flood forecasting in Africa and assess climate impacts on mountain snow packs in the Himalayas, among other efforts. These programs are but a few examples of many NASA-supported projects. Hundreds of other researchers, government agencies, and non-profits develop their own water-management tools and applications using NASA's free and open datasets. NASA is improving on existing and developing new remote sensing methods that can reveal how much water is stored in mountain and seasonal snowpack – one of the world's most vital sources of fresh water. More than a billion people, spanning multiple continents, rely on water from mountain snow for their water supplies that support drinking water, farming, and even hydroelectric power. Snowfall patterns shift over time, however, both year-to-year from natural variability and due to long-term climate effects. With persistent human demands, the ability to accurately measure how much water is in mountain snowpack becomes an even more critical capability. Through the Airborne Snow Observatory program, NASA and California's Department of Water Resources use instruments mounted on airplanes to create high resolution estimates of snow water content for priority watersheds in the Western U.S. The collected data helps determine the timing of the spring melt, which has downstream effects on hydroelectric power generation and planning for how much water can be held in reservoirs. NASA is also focused on the long-term development of tools to measure water in snow through an airborne field campaign called SnowEx. This type of field campaign connects detailed measurements of snow in the Colorado Rocky Mountains taken by researchers on the ground to remote sensing observations made by aircraft flying over the ground sites. The connections made from these highly detailed datasets will help scientists design future satellite missions that will make similar measurements from space. Airborne snow measurements, as well as other programs, complement long-term regional observations from NASA satellites that create estimates for entire mountain ranges in the Western U.S. and around the world. When we think of water on Earth we may think of the ocean, rivers and lakes. But as water cycles around the planet, the atmosphere holds moisture, creating a reservoir in the sky that periodically condenses into rain and snow. NASA is part of a team from more than a dozen countries whose satellites are working together to deliver global rainfall data every half hour. Over land, rain has immediate impact as it soaks into the ground, which supports crops. Rainfall data is one of the most essential for monitoring fresh water's movement around the planet, and goes into applications that touch people's everyday lives, including weather forecasting, crop monitoring, and flood prediction. For many parts of the world, especially developing countries and hard-to-reach terrain where ground measurements are sparse to non-existent, these global NASA datasets are sometimes the only consistent source of information on rainfall and soil moisture. NASA satellites monitoring Earth's gravity field have given scientists insight into the movement of large masses such as ice and water – including water hidden underground. This global look at changes to the amount of water storied in aquifers, massive underground freshwater reservoirs, has revealed some concerning trends. Of the 37 largest aquifers on Earth, a third of them are being depleted by communities pumping the water faster than it recharges from rainfall. These water declines occur primarily where agriculture and aquifers coincide, and where human water demands can easily exacerbate conditions of periodic drought. Among those most stressed in the past decade are the Central Valley of California, the Indus Basin in northwestern India and Pakistan, and the Arabian Aquifer System in Saudi Arabia. About 70 percent of all fresh water on Earth is used for irrigated agriculture. Underground aquifers are water sources that act like waiting bank savings accounts, providing a dependable supply and making agriculture possible in arid areas where significant rain events may only occur once a year and during droughts when surface water is scarce. We do not know the full extent of these underground water aquifers or when they may run dry, but understanding the change in available water that occurs both seasonally and throughout the satellite record helps decision-makers manage their resources. In addition to witnessing the effects of agriculture, the satellite data show the effects of climate change, most notably in the decline of sea ice and ice sheets at the poles. They also observe the ups and downs of more natural variability that reflects a region's span of wet or dry years. As the global satellite record extends into the future, researchers and water managers will continue to monitor fresh water hidden below as climate patterns shift and human demands grow.

    "content": "By Esprit Smith, NASA's Earth Science News Team The Amazon rainforest. Credit: Marcio Isensee e Sa / Adobe Stock › Larger view A new NASA study shows that over the last 20 years, the atmosphere above the Amazon rainforest has been drying out, increasing the demand for water and leaving ecosystems vulnerable to fires and drought. It also shows that this increase in dryness is primarily the result of human activities. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, analyzed decades of ground and satellite data over the Amazon rainforest to track both how much moisture was in the atmosphere and how much moisture was needed to maintain the rainforest system. \"We observed that in the last two decades, there has been a significant increase in dryness in the atmosphere as well as in the atmospheric demand for water above the rainforest,\" said JPL's Armineh Barkhordarian, lead author of the study. \"In comparing this trend to data from models that estimate climate variability over thousands of years, we determined that the change in atmospheric aridity is well beyond what would be expected from natural climate variability.\" So if it's not natural, what's causing it? Barkhordarian said that elevated greenhouse gas levels are responsible for approximately half of the increased aridity. The rest is the result of ongoing human activity, most significantly, the burning of forests to clear land for agriculture and grazing. The combination of these activities is causing the Amazon's climate to warm. When a forest burns, it releases particles called aerosols into the atmosphere - among them, black carbon, commonly referred to as soot. While bright-colored or translucent aerosols reflect radiation, darker aerosols absorb it. When the black carbon absorbs heat from the sun, it causes the atmosphere to warm; it can also interfere with cloud formation and, consequently, rainfall. The Amazon is the largest rainforest on Earth. When healthy, it absorbs billions of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) a year through photosynthesis - the process plants use to convert CO2, energy and water into food. By removing CO2 from the atmosphere, the Amazon helps to keep temperatures down and regulate climate. But it's a delicate system that's highly sensitive to drying and warming trends. Trees and plants need water for photosynthesis and to cool themselves down when they get too warm. They pull in water from the soil through their roots and release water vapor through pores on their leaves into the atmosphere, where it cools the air and eventually rises to form clouds. The clouds produce rain that replenishes the water in the soil, allowing the cycle to continue. Rainforests generate as much as 80 percent of their own rain, especially during the dry season. But when this cycle is disrupted by an increase in dry air, for instance, a new cycle is set into motion - one with significant implications, particularly in the southeastern Amazon, where trees can experience more than four to five months of dry season. \"It's a matter of supply and demand. With the increase in temperature and drying of the air above the trees, the trees need to transpire to cool themselves and to add more water vapor into the atmosphere. But the soil doesn't have extra water for the trees to pull in,\" said JPL's Sassan Saatchi, co-author of the study. \"Our study shows that the demand is increasing, the supply is decreasing and if this continues, the forest may no longer be able to sustain itself.\" Scientists observed that the most significant and systematic drying of the atmosphere is in the southeast region, where the bulk of deforestation and agricultural expansion is happening. But they also found episodic drying in the northwest Amazon, an area that typically has no dry season. Normally always wet, the northwest has suffered severe droughts over the past two decades, a further indication of the entire forest's vulnerability to increasing temperatures and dry air. If this trend continues over the long term and the rainforest reaches the point where it can no longer function properly, many of the trees and the species that live within the rainforest ecosystem may not be able to survive. As the trees die, particularly the larger and older ones, they release CO2 into the atmosphere; and the fewer trees there are, the less CO2 the Amazon region would be able to absorb - meaning we'd essentially lose an important element of climate regulation. The study, \"A Recent Systematic Increase in Vapor Pressure Deficit Over Tropical South America,\" was published in October in Scientific Reports. The science team used data from NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite.

Learn more. NASA satellites are a prominent tool for accounting for water, as it constantly cycles from water vapor to rain and snow falling onto soils, and across and beneath the landscape. As Earth’s atmosphere warms due to greenhouse gases and the satellite data record continues to get longer and more detailed, scientists are studying how climate change is affecting the distribution of water. Trends are beginning to emerge, especially at the extremes in the frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts. These trends affect everything from local weather to where crops can grow, and have consequences that will ripple through communities today and in the coming century. When thinking about changes to the distribution of water around the planet, it's not just knowing where it rains or doesn't, but also how much, and how frequently heavy rain falls versus light rain. Rainfall amount impacts soils saturation and how high streams and rivers rise, which then changes their capacity to hold more in the event of another storm. Lack of rain stresses vegetation and supplemental water reserves, and when their frequency increases, those reserves are less likely to recover before the next dry spell. NASA satellite data and ground measurements support research into long-term changes to water distribution. One of those efforts is the U.S. National Climate Assessment, which studies climate change and its potential impacts in each region of the country. Among those changes, for example, is an observed increase in very heavy precipitation events across the United States. From",

    "date": null,
    "content": "A new satellite-based map of a section of the Amazon Basin reveals that at least some of the massive fires burning there this past summer were concentrated in water-stressed areas of the rainforest. The stressed plants released measurably less water vapor into the air than unstressed plants; in other words, they were struggling to stay cool and conserve water, leaving them more vulnerable to the fires. The fires in the Amazon Basin, which continue to burn into November, are mainly the result of such human activities as land clearing and deforestation. The pattern — spotted from space by NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) — points to how water-stressed plants can impact the spread of fires. The data may one day help NASA's Earth-observing missions predict the path of future forest or brush fires like those currently raging in California. The primary mission of ECOSTRESS, an instrument that measures thermal infrared energy emitted from the land surface, is to provide insight into plants' health by taking their temperature. To keep cool, plants \"sweat\" by releasing water vapor through their pores, a process called evapotranspiration. After multiple orbits, ECOSTRESS is able to measure how much plants transpire and track their response to climate change. In August, fires spread over large swaths of the Amazon Basin. ECOSTRESS captured the first image of the Amazon rainforest in Peru before the fires began, on Aug. 7. It shows a surface temperature map revealing water-stressed and non-stressed forest (shown in brown and blue, respectively). The fire icons represent fires imaged by NASA's Terra satellite between Aug. 19 and 26. The fires are limited primarily to areas of water-stressed plants that transpired the least. The second image, taken by the Terra satellite on Aug. 18, shows the ECOSTRESS study area and smoke from active fires in the rainforest. The image also reveals how certain parts of the forest were more resilient, seeming to protect themselves from burning. Plants in these areas were cooler — in other words, they released more water vapor from their leaves — than plants in the burn zones, though mission scientists don't know whether that's a coincidence or a direct causal relationship. The water-stressed areas of the forest look as green and healthy as these cooler areas, making them invisible except to a radiometer that can measure thermal infrared energy from the surface. \"To the naked eye, the fires appear randomly distributed throughout the forest,\" said Josh Fisher, ECOSTRESS science lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"But, if you overlay the ECOSTRESS data, you can see that the fires are mainly confined within the highly water-stressed areas. The fires avoided the low-stress areas where the forest appears to have access to more water.\" It's still a mystery why some plants become stressed while other plants don't, though scientists believe it's dependent on factors like the species of plant or amount of water in the soil. The data from ECOSTRESS will help answer questions about which plants will thrive in their changing environments and could also be used to help with decisions related to water management and agricultural irrigation. JPL built and manages the ECOSTRESS mission for the Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. ECOSTRESS is an Earth Venture Instrument mission; this program is managed by NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder program at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

The data are derived from airborne remote-sensing, surface-monitoring networks and satellites and are presented on an interactive map alongside infrastructure information. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech › Larger view NASA scientists are helping California create a detailed, statewide inventory of methane point sources — highly concentrated methane releases from single sources — using a specialized airborne sensor. The new data, published this week in the journal Nature, can be used to target actions to reduce emissions of this potent greenhouse gas. Like carbon dioxide, methane traps heat in the atmosphere, but it does so more efficiently and for a shorter period of time. Scientists estimate that most methane emissions in California are driven by industrial facilities, such as oil and gas fields, large dairies and landfills. To help reduce methane's impact on climate, the state has made cutting human-caused emissions a priority. But in order to cut these hard-to-detect emissions, they have to be measured and the sources identified. NASA, through partnerships with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the California Energy Commission, set out to do just that. Over a two-year period, a research team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, flew a plane equipped with the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) instrument over nearly 300,000 facilities and infrastructure components in those sectors. The instrument can detect plumes of methane in great detail. Each pixel covers an area of about 10 feet (3 meters) across, which allows scientists to see even small plumes that often go undetected. The team identified more than 550 individual point sources emitting plumes of highly concentrated methane. Ten percent of these sources, considered super-emitters, contributed the majority of the emissions detected. The team estimates that statewide, super-emitters are responsible for about a third of California's total methane budget. Emissions data like this can help facility operators identify and correct problems — and in turn, bring California closer to its emissions goals. For example, of the 270 surveyed landfills, only 30 were observed to emit large plumes of methane. However, those 30 were responsible for 40 percent of the total point-source emissions detected during the survey. This type of data could help these facilities to identify possible leaks or malfunctions in their gas-capture systems. \"These findings illustrate the importance of monitoring point sources across multiple sectors [of the economy] and broad regions, both for improved understanding of methane budgets and to support emission mitigation efforts,\" said the lead scientist on the study, Riley Duren, who conducted the work for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Initial results have been shared with facility operators in California to make them aware of the need to improve their methane-leak detection processes and to institute better controls on methane emissions. Results will also be used to help state and local agencies and businesses prioritize investments in methane-emission mitigation. Although the survey provides a detailed map of methane emissions for the areas observed in the state, researchers caution that this was the first attempt to estimate emissions for individual methane sources from a large population distributed across such an extensive area over multiple years. Additionally, this survey was designed to detect highly concentrated releases of methane from a single component or piece of industrial equipment, such as an oil well. The survey excluded non-point sources, such as small natural gas leaks from millions of homes, because even though they may have a collective impact on atmospheric methane levels, their individual emissions are below the detection levels of this method. The survey builds on a decade of cooperation between NASA, CARB and the California Energy Commission to support the state's ambitious climate change mitigation program, specifically on the study of air pollution impacts from the oil and gas sector. \"This new remote-sensing technology addresses the continuing need for detailed, high-quality data about methane,\" said California Air Resources Board Chair Mary D. Nichols. \"It will help us and the Energy Commission develop the best strategies for capturing this highly potent greenhouse gas.\" The final report of the California Methane Survey will be available in the fall.

The study team, led by Hartmut Aumann of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, combed through 15 years of data acquired by NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument over the tropical oceans to determine the relationship between the average sea surface temperature and the onset of severe storms. They found that extreme storms - those producing at least 0.12 inches (3 millimeters) of rain per hour over a 16-mile (25-kilometer) area - formed when the sea surface temperature was higher than about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius). They also found that, based on the data, 21 percent more storms form for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) that ocean surface temperatures rise. \"It is somewhat common sense that severe storms will increase in a warmer environment. Thunderstorms typically occur in the warmest season of the year,\" Aumann explained. \"But our data provide the first quantitative estimate of how much they are likely to increase, at least for the tropical oceans.\" Currently accepted climate models project that with a steady increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (1 percent per year), tropical ocean surface temperatures may rise by as much as 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.7 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. The study team concludes that if this were to happen, we could expect the frequency of extreme storms to increase by as much as 60 percent by that time. Although climate models aren't perfect, results like these can serve as a guideline for those looking to prepare for the potential effects a changing climate may have. \"Our results quantify and give a more visual meaning to the consequences of the predicted warming of the oceans,\" Aumann said. \"More storms mean more flooding, more structure damage, more crop damage and so on, unless mitigating measures are implemented.\" The peer-reviewed study was published in the December",

    "content": "4 min read By Pat Brennan,NASA's Sea Level Change Portal Planet Earth is losing the battle of the bulge. Rotation makes it slightly fatter in the middle and flatter at the poles; though still quite round, it is not a perfect sphere. This flattening is called “oblateness,” and measuring its changes is a key part of tracking ice loss from polar regions. A recent paper combines measurements of gravity by different methods to more accurately capture how this oblateness changes with time, and improve calculations of ice loss. This new method reveals more ice loss and larger increases in ocean water than previously estimated: an increase of 0.08 millimeters per year for sea level rise, along with an additional 15.4 gigatons of ice loss each year for the Antarctic Ice Sheet and 3.5 for the Greenland Ice Sheet. “The ice sheets are losing more mass, and the ocean is gaining more, than we previously thought,” said Bryant D. Loomis of Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the paper’s lead author. One way scientists measure the loss of melting ice and the resulting shifting of mass, from ice sheets to the ocean, is by NASA’s GRACE satellites (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) — both the now-ended original mission and its sequel, GRACE-FO (Follow-On). For both missions, a pair of satellites was designed to keep sharp track of each other’s movements as they pass over Earth’s surface. Large masses on or near the surface below — mountains, glaciers or hidden expanses of subsurface groundwater — give a gravitational tug on the first of the passing spacecraft. That causes a slight increase in speed; the microwave link with the second satellite is stretched a bit, changing again as the second satellite passes over. The size of these changes in distance between the satellites reveals the mass of the objects below. When it comes to measuring changes in the oblateness, however, GRACE and GRACE-FO are not as accurate as another method. “That’s the only part of the gravity field GRACE doesn’t observe well,” Loomis said. Fortunately, changes in the oblateness are well-observed by the other method, called satellite laser ranging or SLR. This technology, which dates back to the",

This image shows San Francisco Bay. Credit: NASA In response to the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) have joined forces to use the collective scientific power of their Earth-observing satellite data to document planet-wide changes in the environment and human society. The wealth of these agencies’ collective information now is available at the touch of a finger. In an unprecedented collaboration, the three space agencies have created the joint COVID-19 Earth Observation Dashboard, which integrates multiple satellite data records with analytical tools to allow user-friendly tracking of changes in air and water quality, climate change, economic activity, and agriculture. This tri-agency data resource gives the public and policymakers a unique tool to probe the short-term and long-term impacts of pandemic-related restrictions implemented around the world. The dashboard will continue to grow with new observations added over the coming months as the global economy gradually reopens. “Together NASA, ESA, and JAXA represent a great human asset: advanced Earth-observing instruments in space that are used every day to benefit society and advance knowledge about our home planet,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science. “When we began to see from space how changing patterns of human activity caused by the pandemic were having a visible impact on the planet, we knew that if we combined resources, we could bring a powerful new analytical tool to bear on this fast-moving crisis.” In April, the three agencies formed a task force to take on the challenge. The group identified the most relevant satellite data streams and adapted existing computing infrastructure to share data from across the agencies and produce relevant indicators. The dashboard presents users with seamless access to data indicating changes in air and water quality, economic and agricultural activity on a global scale and in select areas of interest. Air quality changes around the world were among the first noticeable impacts of pandemic-related stay-at-home orders and reductions in industrial activity that emerged from satellite observations. One air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is primarily the result of burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation, shows up clearly in satellite data. NO2 has a lifetime of a few hours and is a precursor of ground-level ozone, which makes it a useful indicator of short-term air quality changes. The dashboard brings together current NO2 data from two NASA and ESA satellites, along with historical data for comparison. In additional to the global view of NO2, targeted regional areas include Los Angeles, Tokyo, Beijing, Paris, and Madrid. Changes in another critical component of our atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2), are highlighted in the dashboard to probe how global and local reactions to the pandemic have changed concentrations of this climate-warming greenhouse gas. Because of CO2’s high background concentration in the atmosphere and its long atmospheric lifetime of more than 100 years, short-term changes in atmospheric CO2 resulting from changes in anthropogenic emissions are very small relative to expected variations in abundances from the natural carbon cycle. A recent study in the journal Nature estimated that a three-month economic slowdown such as the world has just experienced would temporarily reduce the expected increase in CO2 concentrations from emissions into the atmosphere by a fraction of a percent. The dashboard presents data from a NASA satellite to look for global-scale, long-term changes in CO2. Carbon dioxide observations from a JAXA satellite zooms in on changes in select urban areas such as New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Delhi. Analysis from both NASA and JAXA data sets are consistent with the estimates of emission reductions in the Nature study. Recent water quality changes have been reported in a few locations that typically have intense human activities, such as industry and tourism, which have decreased during the pandemic. The dashboard presents targeted satellite observations from all three agencies of total suspended matter and chlorophyll concentrations in select coastal areas, harbors, and semi-enclosed bays to assess what has produced these changes in water quality, how widespread they may be, and how long they last. Long Island Sound, the North Adriatic Sea, and Tokyo Bay are among the areas examined. Widespread declines in global economic activity are a well-known impact of the pandemic. Observations from space over time of shipping activity in ports, cars parked at shopping centers, and nighttime lights in urban areas can be used as indicators of how specific sectors of the economy have been affected. Satellite data from each agency and commercial data purchased by NASA and ESA are presented in the dashboard to quantify these changes in Los Angeles; the Port of Dunkirk, France; Ghent, Belgium; Beijing, and other locations. The dashboard will also present tri-agency satellite data looking for signs of changes in agricultural production around the world, such as harvesting and planting due to disruptions in the food supply chain or the availability of labor. Understanding the extent of any such changes would be important in maintaining global and local markets and food security as the world recovers from the pandemic.

An unusually cold Arctic air mass, called a polar vortex, is responsible for the severe temperatures, which in many areas have plunged well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius). NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite captured the polar vortex as it moved southward from central Canada into the U.S. Midwest from Jan. 20 through Jan. 29. The illustration shows temperatures at an altitude of about 10,000 to 15,000 feet (600 millibars atmospheric pressure) above the ground. The lowest temperatures are shown in purple and blue and range from -40 degrees Fahrenheit (also -40 degrees Celsius) to -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius). As the data series progresses, you can see how the coldest purple areas of the air mass scoop down into the U.S. The polar vortex is responsible for a number of deaths, disruptions to services, and energy outages in the affected areas. AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface.

NASA-NOAA’s Suomi NPP satellite showed the blanket of dust had moved over the Gulf of Mexico and extended into Central America and over part of the eastern Pacific Ocean. NASA uses satellites and other resources to track aerosol particles made of desert dust, smoke, and volcanic ash. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard Suomi NPP provided a visible image, while the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) Nadir-Mapper (NM) instrument aboard the Suomi-NPP satellite provided absorbing aerosol index values. The OMPS index indicates the presence of light absorbing aerosol particles (ultraviolet-absorbing, or UV-absorbing, particles in the air) such as desert dust. The absorbing aerosol index is related to both the thickness and height of the aerosol layer. The Absorbing Aerosol Index is useful for identifying and tracking the long-range transport of volcanic ash from volcanic eruptions, smoke from wildfires or biomass burning events and dust from desert dust storms. These aerosol particals can even be tracked over clouds and areas covered by snow and ice. Colin Seftor, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., created imagery from the Suomi NPP OMPS absorbing aerosol index and visible imagery from the VIIRS instrument. He said that on June 23 and 24 the dust plume had moved completely over Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, up through the Gulf of Mexico and into southern Texas. “At that point, the situation becomes more complicated because the absorbing aerosol index signal seen farther north into Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, etc., is probably a mix of dust and smoke from the numerous fires burning in the southwest U.S. You can also see that the dust traveled over Central America and out into the Eastern Pacific Ocean.” On June 25, an animation that combined OMPS aerosol index and VIIRS visible imagery from NASA/NOAA’s Suomi NPP satellite was created at NASA Goddard showing the movement the Saharan dust cloud from June 15 to 25,",

    "content": "5 min read By Elizabeth Goldbaum,NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center This article is part of a series that explores NASA research into Earth's fresh water and surveys how those advances help people solve real world problems. Learn more. Snowflakes that cover mountains or linger under tree canopies are a vital freshwater resource for over a billion people around the world. To help determine how much fresh water is stored in snow, a team of NASA-funded researchers is creating a computer-based tool that simulates the best way to detect snow and measure its water content from space. Snow’s water content, or snow water equivalent (SWE) is a “holy grail for many hydrologists,” said Bart Forman, the project’s principal investigator and a professor with the University of Maryland, College Park. When snow melts, the ensuing puddle of water is its SWE. In western U.S. states, snow is the main source of drinking water and water from snow is a major contributor to hydroelectric power generation and agriculture. Some changes in snowfall patterns are indicators of climate change. For instance, warmer temperatures cause water to fall as rain instead of snow. As a result, some mountains are not able to hold water in the form of snowpack like they used to, which means rain inundates rivers and floods are more intense. When flood season is over, droughts can be more severe. Forman’s new approach follows efforts by NASA to study SWE from satellites, airplanes and the field. The Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an instrument aboard two satellites that captures daily images of Earth. MODIS can identify snow-covered land and ice on lakes and large rivers. The Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM), an international constellation of satellites, can observe rain and falling snow over the entire globe every two to three hours. In addition to space-based observations, NASA runs a campaign closer to home called SnowEX. The campaign is a five-year program that includes airborne observations and then field work to reveal what satellite efforts do not. SnowEX allows researchers to examine complex terrains that can be difficult to characterize from space. Next winter’s campaign will collaborate with the Airborne Snow Observatory, which measures snow depth and snow characteristics. “We would love to have a global map of SWE,” said Edward Kim, a research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. However, there is no single technique that can measure SWE globally because snow properties vary depending on where it lands, Kim said. It often forms a deeper layer in forests, where it is sheltered from the Sun, but keeps a shallower profile in the tundra and prairie, where it is exposed to wind and higher temperatures. Snow changes its shape as it falls to the surface and then continues to change in its resting place. Its shape can determine which sensor is able to observe it, Kim said, adding another complexity to estimated SWE. Forman and his team’s new tool will determine the most effective combination of satellite-based sensors to produce the most data. “The tool will show us how to make intelligent choices about how to combine sensors,” Kim said. The tool evaluates three different types of Earth-orbiting sensors: radar, radiometer and lidar. The team looked at radar and radiometer information from existing sensors, such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) radiometer. The sensor launched as a partnership led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to capture microwave emissions from Earth’s surface and atmosphere. It aims to identify snow cover, sea surface temperatures, soil moisture and other factors critical to understanding Earth’s climate. For radar observations, the team included data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel 1A and 1B satellites, which monitor land and ocean surfaces. In addition to including radar and radiometer sensors, which are currently monitoring snow from space, the new tool’s simulation includes lidar; lidar has flown aboard airplanes to measure snow over specified areas. For instance, the SnowEx campaign and NASA’s Airborne Snow Observatory use lidar to determine snow depth and SWE. “We can help explore the question, what if we had a snow-centric observing satellite mission in space?” Forman said. “In order to do all this, you have to use supercomputers,” Forman said. Specifically, the Discover Supercomputer at Goddard and Deepthought2 High-Performance Computing cluster at the University of Maryland. Once the data from the different sensors are in the simulation tool, the team is able to run experiments that include different scenarios, such as putting a satellite into one orbit versus another, or having a satellite look at a wide swath versus narrow swath of Earth. With this suite of experiments, they can compare how well a certain combination performs compared to a benchmark scenario, Forman said. As a general rule, with more satellites in orbit, scientists would have higher quality data, Forman said. However, “We can ask, what is the marginal gain if we had one more radiometer?” Forman said. The new snow-sensing simulation tool will help create a space-based snow observation strategy to better understand this vital freshwater resource. The simulator will be used to “continue to ask questions of what should be next and how we should be planning in 20 years or more,” Forman said. This new snow simulation tool is funded by NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office. NASA satellite data and citizen science observations combine for new findings on bird populations.

    "content": "6 min read By Bob Silberg,NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ◆ Understanding how greenhouse gases will affect clouds is crucial to forecasting climate change. But current computer climate models can’t handle the high resolution needed to simulate cloud dynamics worldwide. ◆ A recent study suggests that if greenhouse gases raise the atmosphere’s temperature enough, stratocumulus clouds could disappear, causing a large spike in global temperature. ◆ JPL is partnering with Caltech, MIT and the Naval Postgraduate School to build a new climate model that can take full advantage of Earth-observing satellites, with thousands of sub-models capable of simulating the dynamics of clouds and other small-scale phenomena. Crocodile bones, 50 million years old, have shown up on the Arctic island of Ellesmere, and that’s a problem. Scientists have been unable to explain how the Arctic could have warmed up enough to host those tropical creatures. Tapio Schneider, a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and professor at Caltech, thinks the answer may lie in the clouds. Given that they are so insubstantial—all the moisture that constitutes clouds planetwide at any given moment would amount to no more than a micro-thin film of water if spread out over Earth’s surface—clouds have an outsized impact on our climate. They cool Earth's surface by reflecting much of the Sun’s energy back into space. They warm like blankets by preventing the planet from radiating away all of the heat it absorbs each day. And of course, they are key components of the water cycle, storing water that has evaporated from the oceans and other bodies and then returning it as rain and snow. It stands to reason that any computer model that hopes to explain past climates or forecast how ours will change would have to take clouds into account. And that’s primarily where climate models fall short. Climate models are digital simulations of Earth’s climate that run on supercomputers. Each model works by dividing the atmosphere into a three-dimensional grid and calculating what goes on within each box of that grid. You input things like temperature, humidity and pressure, and the model uses physics to compute how weather will develop within each box, what effects those developments will have on neighboring boxes, what effects those neighboring boxes will have on their neighbors, and on and on all over the planet and into the future. The problem that climate models have with clouds is that cloud behavior operates on a much finer scale than the grid boxes that the models employ. You would need to divide the atmosphere into boxes a thousand times smaller to capture those physics. And you would need a supercomputer vastly more powerful than today’s best in order to run the calculations for the entire planet in a useful amount of time. But today’s supercomputers can handle that kind of resolution for a much more limited region, and the cloud dynamics observed there can help us understand what happens over much larger regions. So Schneider led a study at Caltech, using a little more than 12 cubic miles (52 cubic kilometers) of simulated atmosphere, divided into 2 million grid boxes that were small enough to capture cloud dynamics. The goal was to see how increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is likely to affect the development of stratocumulus clouds over tropical oceans, and how global temperature could change as a result. Low-lying stratocumulus clouds are the most common type on Earth, and they’re the heavyweight champs among clouds at cooling the planet. If the buildup of greenhouse gases were to increase even slightly how much of Earth’s surface these clouds cover, global warming would slow down significantly. But if cloud coverage were to decrease, the world would heat up faster. In Schneider’s high-resolution simulation, global temperature rose and stratocumulus clouds thinned at a fairly steady pace as CO2 concentration increased—until the concentration reached roughly triple today’s level. At that point, the clouds broke up. And without their cooling effect, global temperature jumped by 8°C (about 14°F). If this is what happened 50 million years ago, Schneider said, the surge of heat from the loss of the clouds, on top of the warming from the increase in greenhouse gases, could have raised temperatures enough to make the Arctic suitable for crocodiles. If we continue releasing greenhouse gases at our current rate, he added, we could reach that point again somewhere around the beginning of the next century. Further, returning to our current “normal” might not be easy. In Schneider’s model, once the stratocumulus clouds were lost, greenhouse-gas concentration had to fall to about half of today’s level before the clouds returned to their present state. This small-scale simulation might or might not show what really could happen all over the world. But incorporating thousands of such simulations, representing key spots throughout the planet, into a global model could dramatically improve the model's ability to calculate cloud behavior worldwide and the future of Earth's climate. Schneider hopes to make such a global climate model a reality through the work of the Climate Modeling Alliance, a coalition of scientists, engineers and mathematicians from JPL, Caltech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Naval Postgraduate School­. And the new model promises other important improvements as well. “We live in a golden age of Earth observations from space,” Schneider said, and the new model is being designed to automatically incorporate the flood of data continually pouring down from our Earth-observing satellites, as well as from ocean buoys and other sources. That, Schneider said, means the new model will be able to take advantage of much more observational data than current models can employ. The new model also aims to automate and improve the current process of tweaking a model to bring it into closer agreement with actual measurements. “Right now, there’s manual calibration of just a few points, a few parameters, relative to very few pieces of data,” Schneider said. “We want to do the same thing, but with all imprecisely known parameters of the model rather than just a few, and using data much more massively.” This level of accuracy stands to benefit everyone who needs to plan for the challenges ahead, from the leaders of governments and businesses to individuals. “Just as you now have weather-forecasting apps on the phone in your pocket, helping you make decisions about the future, we want to make sure that in a few years, you can have climate-prediction apps on your phone,” Schneider said. “So, for example, when you buy a house, you can know how likely it is that the forest behind the house will burn or that the neighborhood will be flooded. I would say within 5 years, we’ll have it.” NASA uses satellite lidar technology to study Earth’s forests, key carbon sinks.

    "content": "4 min read Warm the Antarctic, and southern Florida drowns. And as West Antarctica melts, its famous peninsula becomes an island. These calamities are, for now, safely contained in a web-based simulation just released to the public. You can take charge of the controls – ice melt caused by a warming ocean, snowfall, temperature, friction – and get a feel for how a warming world could diminish the frozen continent and raise sea levels over the coming century. But the newest simulation from scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory isn’t just an entertaining toy. It’s fed by real data from the powerful Ice Sheet System Model, or ISSM – the same computer model scientists use to try to predict how quickly polar ice will melt, as well as where, and when, rising seas will inundate shorelines. The sliding control features of the simulation – more or less ice melt, higher or lower snowfall – track some of the same changes researchers must grapple with as they try to project real-world effects into the future. It’s meant, in part, to give all of us a more detailed picture not only of the possible changes to come, but of just where the uncertainties lie. “There are pretty large uncertainties in specific, key parameters needed to even run an ice sheet model,” said JPL Earth scientist Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, lead author of a recent paper that tries to better define these areas of uncertainty. At the same time, the paper attempts to show both the worst-case scenarios and less extreme but more likely outcomes – which still would have profound effects on Antarctica and distant shorelines. Both Arctic and Antarctic ice is melting in response to warming temperatures, amounting to net losses in the hundreds of gigatons per year. Along with warming, expanding ocean water, ice melt is driving sea levels higher, and the rate of rise is accelerating. But projecting these changes into the future requires a deep understanding of key variables: snowfall, ice melt caused by warming ocean waters, how easily glaciers slide along their bedrock base and the temperature of the ice itself. Modelers also must provide a range of estimates for factors that cannot be determined precisely. Whether human emissions of climate-warming, greenhouse gases will rise, fall or remain about the same is one of these big unknowns. After multiple computer modeling runs under several scenarios – in other words, putting the model through its paces as it simulates Antarctic ice melt and resulting sea-level rise over the next century – one factor loomed large, Schlegel said. “One of the major results was that ocean forcing (warming ocean water melting ice from below) really dominates over all the others,” she said. “It causes the largest spread of uncertainty.” Knowing which factors cause the greatest uncertainty will help sharpen modeling projections. The study also revealed that under the most extreme warming scenario over the next 100 years, the Amundsen Sea sector in the western portion of the continent has the largest potential sea level contribution – 297 millimeters, or nearly a foot of global sea level rise. But oddly, under a less extreme but more scientifically likely scenario, Antarctica’s Ronne basin, in the northwest, moves into first place. Melting ice streams in this basin could cause about half a foot (161 millimeters) of sea level rise. And these are only two of the modeled contributions. Combine all the other sources of expected ice melt and ocean expansion, and scientists estimate that we could see several feet of sea level rise in the century ahead. The new study continues a critical, long-term effort of sea level scientists: narrow uncertainty and improve the accuracy of ice-melt simulations. “It ends up being a very important future endeavor for us, model-wise,” Schlegel said. “It’s very important to know how ocean temperature progresses as ice changes.” Proof-of-concept results from the mouth of the Tijuana River in San Diego County show how… The international mission collects two-dimensional views of smaller waves and currents that are bringing into… Explore Earth Science NASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.

Learn more. Himalaya. Karakoram. Hindu Kush. The names of Asia's high mountain ranges conjure up adventure to those living far away, but for more than a billion people, these are the names of their most reliable water source. Snow and glaciers in these mountains contain the largest volume of fresh water outside of Earth's polar ice sheets, leading hydrologists to nickname this region the Third Pole. One-seventh of the world's population depends on rivers flowing from these mountains for water to drink and to irrigate crops. Rapid changes in the region's climate, however, are affecting glacier melt and snowmelt. People in the region are already modifying their land-use practices in response to the changing water supply, and the region's ecology is transforming. Future changes are likely to influence food and water security in India, Pakistan, China and other nations. NASA is keeping a space-based eye on changes like these worldwide to better understand the future of our planet's water cycle. In this region where there are extreme challenges in collecting observations on the ground, NASA's satellite and other resources can produce substantial benefits to climate science and local decision makers tasked with managing an already-scarce resource. The most comprehensive survey ever made of snow, ice and water in these mountains and how they are changing is now underway. NASA's High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT), led by Anthony Arendt of the University of Washington in Seattle, is in its third year. The project consists of 13 coordinated research groups studying three decades of data on this region in three broad areas: weather and climate; ice and snow; and downstream hazards and impacts. All three of these subject areas are changing, starting with climate. Warming air and alterations in monsoon patterns affect the regional water cycle – how much snow and rain falls, and how and when the snowpack and glaciers melt. Changes in the water cycle raise or lower the risk of local hazards such as landslides and flooding, and have broad impacts on water allocation and crops that can be grown. For most of human history, a detailed scientific study of these mountains was impossible. The mountains are too high and steep, and the weather too dangerous. The satellite era has given us the first opportunity to observe and measure snow and ice cover safely in places where no human has ever set foot. \"The explosive growth of satellite technology has been incredible for this region,\" said Jeffrey Kargel, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and leader of a HiMAT team studying glacial lakes. \"We can do things now that we couldn't do ten years ago – and ten years ago we did things we couldn't do before that.\" Kargel also credited advances in computer technology that have enabled far more researchers to undertake large data-processing efforts, which are required to improve weather forecasting over such complex topography. Arendt's HiMAT team is charged with integrating the many, varied types of satellite observations and existing numerical models to create an authoritative estimate of the water budget of this region and a set of products local policy makers can use in planning for a changing water supply. A number of data sets by HiMAT teams have already been uploaded to NASA's Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Collectively, the suite of new products is called the Glacier and Snow Melt (GMELT) Toolbox. There's some urgency in completing the toolbox, because changes in melt patterns appear to be increasing the region's hazards – some of which are found only in this kind of terrain, such as debris dam \"failures\" on glacial lakes and surging glaciers blocking access to mountain villages and pastures. In the last few decades, towns and infrastructure such as roads and bridges have been wiped out by these events. Kargel's team is studying catastrophic flooding from glacial lakes. These lakes start as melt pools on the surfaces of glaciers, but under the right conditions they may continue to melt all the way to ground level, pooling behind a precarious pile of ice and debris that was originally the front end of the glacier. An earthquake, rockfall or simply the increasing weight of water may breach the debris dam and create a flash flood. Lakes like this were almost unknown 50 or 60 years ago, but as most high mountain Asian glaciers have been shrinking and retreating, glacial lakes have been proliferating and growing. The largest one Kargel has measured, Lower Barun in Nepal, is 673 feet (205 meters) deep with a volume of almost 30 billion gallons (112 million cubic meters), or about 45,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools full. The HiMAT team has mapped every glacial lake larger than about 1,100 feet (330 meters) in diameter for three different time periods – about",

In recent months, NASA has initiated research projects focused on how the human response to the pandemic has affected our environment, like how air quality has improved in the wake of reduced vehicular traffic in many places. But the tentacles of the pandemic extend well beyond that. How have production disruptions affected agriculture and food supply? What about our ability to forecast water availability in coming months? How do changes in activity levels affect environmental conditions? NASA's Earth Science Division recently selected three new projects that aim to answer these and other pandemic-related questions for Rapid Response and Novel Research (RRNES) awards. RRNES is funding quick-turnaround projects that make innovative use of the agency's resources and data to better understand regional-to-global environmental, economic, and societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new projects join a growing list of RRNES research now underway. Shutdowns in response to COVID-19 left many farmers facing two distinct problems: labor shortages brought on by travel restrictions, and falling demand resulting from the closures of restaurants and schools. Realizing that their labor costs would exceed the value of their crops, some farmers decided to forgo harvesting them. The impacts don't stop there. The economic downturn and related unemployment put food security at risk for many people, especially in developing countries. Import and export restrictions, COVID-19 outbreaks in and around port cities, and other supply-chain disruptions have all added to uncertainty in agricultural markets. In order to monitor the development of crop conditions globally, these factors and others need to be taken into consideration. University of Maryland scientist and NASA Harvest data lead Michael Humber and his colleagues are working on a project that brings all of the relevant Earth science data together in one easy-to-access place. In line with the mission of NASA's food-security-focused program, NASA Harvest is striving to expand open access to agricultural data that can help inform food policy decisions. The information available through the tool will provide policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and others with vital information needed to respond to supply disruptions and other challenges proactively and to make the best decisions for their respective communities. In the semiarid western U.S., farmers and water resource managers rely on water supply forecasts both to ensure there is enough water to meet demand and to make the most efficient use of the water available. The primary variable in these forecasts is what's called snow water equivalent, which is the amount of water contained in the snow that accumulates and compacts over the winter. In spring and summer, snowmelt becomes a significant freshwater source. Each month, surveyors take manual measurements of snow water equivalent at hundreds of monitoring stations across the region. But what happens when a global pandemic limits the surveyors' ability to travel and take these measurements? \"As the pandemic evolved, we quickly discovered that the ground-based data that water resource managers have historically relied on for their decision making is potentially not going to be as readily available as it was in the past, because it requires people in trucks or in helicopters going out into the field to make these measurements,\" said University of Colorado scientist Noah Molotch. \"Our project will leverage remotely-sensed snow data to fill these data gaps.\" In doing so, Molotch and his colleagues hope to minimize disruptions to the water supply forecasts on which so many water and agricultural professionals rely. This preliminary map shows the slowdown of activity at Disneyland in California. Areas in blue indicate a reduction in vehicle concentration or movement as a result of COVID-19 pandemic response efforts. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/EOS at Nanyang Technological University Most governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing some form of shutdown; however, shutdown orders and their enforcement have varied extensively at local, national, and global levels. To determine what effects these reductions in activity have had on virus control and on the environment, we need to look at the global picture. Luckily, satellites make that possible. Scientist Sang-Ho Yun and his team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, along with researchers from the Earth Observatory of Singapore, are using satellite-derived synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to map changes in activity levels in cities around the world. SAR data can show changes to Earth's surface over time. In this case, the scientists are looking at things like how the concentration and arrangement of cars in parking lots and on highways has changed from pre-pandemic patterns as well as changes to construction sites. \"Using the SAR data, we'll be able to provide citywide maps that quantify the changes in activity, both the slowing down due to lockdowns and the gradual increase as governments decide to reopen,\" said Yun. \"These maps will help us to better understand how activity reductions correspond to different cities' levels of success in controlling virus outbreaks, and how those reductions correspond to observed improvements in environmental conditions like air quality.\" Research from this project will also be incorporated into NASA's COVID-19 dashboard.

Elephant seals are tagged as part of a French research program called SO-MEMO (Observing System - Mammals as Samplers of the Ocean Environment), operated by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). The tags - actually, sensors with antennas - are glued to the seals' heads in accordance with established ethical standards when the animals come ashore either to breed or to molt. The researchers remove the tags to retrieve their data when the seals return to land. If they miss a tag, it drops off with the dead skin in the next molting season. Credit: Sorbonne University/Etienne Pauthenet › Larger view The Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows in a loop around Antarctica, connecting the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. It is one of the most significant ocean currents in our climate system because it facilitates the exchange of heat and other properties among the oceans it links. But how the current transfers heat, particularly vertically from the top layer of the ocean to the bottom layers and vice versa, is still not fully understood. This current is very turbulent, producing eddies — swirling vortices of water similar to storms in the atmosphere — between 30 to 125 miles (50 to 200 kilometers) in diameter. It also spans some 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) through an especially remote and inhospitable part of the world, making it one of the most difficult currents for scientists — as least those of the human variety — to observe and measure. Luckily for Lia Siegelman, a visiting scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the rough seas posed no challenge for her scientific sidekick: a tagged southern elephant seal. Equipped with a specialized sensor reminiscent of a small hat, the seal swam more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) on a three-month voyage, much of it through the turbulent, eddy-rich waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The seal made around 80 dives at depths ranging from 550 to 1,090 yards (500 to 1,000 meters) per day during this time. All the while, it collected a continuous stream of data that has provided new insight into how heat moves vertically between ocean layers in this volatile region — insight that brings us one step closer to understanding how much heat from the Sun the ocean there is able to absorb. For a new paper published recently in Nature Geoscience, Siegelman and her co-authors combined the seal's data with satellite altimetry data. The satellite data of the ocean surface showed where the swirling eddies were within the current and which eddies the seal was swimming through. Analyzing the combined dataset, the scientists paid particular attention to the role smaller ocean features played in vertical heat transport. Siegelman was surprised by the results. \"These medium-sized eddies are known to drive the production of small-scale fronts — sudden changes in water density similar to cold and warm fronts in the atmosphere,\" she said. \"We found that these fronts were evident some 500 meters [550 yards] into the ocean interior, not just in the surface layer like many studies suggest, and that they played an active role in vertical heat transport.\" According to Siegelman, their analysis showed that these fronts act like ducts that carry a lot of heat from the ocean interior back to the surface. \"Most current modeling studies indicate that the heat would move from the surface to the ocean interior in these cases, but with the new observational data provided by the seal, we found that that's not the case,\" she said. The ocean surface layer can absorb only a finite amount of heat before natural processes, like evaporation and precipitation, kick in to cool it down. When deep ocean fronts send heat to the surface, that heat warms the surface layer and pushes it closer to its heat threshold. So essentially, in the areas where this dynamic is present, the ocean isn't able to absorb as much heat from the Sun as it otherwise could. Current climate models and those used to estimate Earth's heat budget don't factor in the effects of these small-scale ocean fronts, but the paper's authors argue that they should. \"Inaccurate representation of these small-scale fronts could considerably underestimate the amount of heat transferred from the ocean interior back to the surface and, as a consequence, potentially overestimate the amount of heat the ocean can absorb,\" Siegelman said. \"This could be an important implication for our climate and the ocean's role in offsetting the effects of global warming by absorbing most of the heat.\" The scientists say this phenomenon is also likely present in other turbulent areas of the ocean where eddies are common, including the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio Extension in the North Pacific Ocean. Although their results are significant, Siegelman says more research is needed to fully understand and quantify the long-term effects these fronts may have on the global ocean and our climate system. For example, the study is based on observations in the late spring and early summer. Results may be more pronounced during winter months, when these small-scale fronts tend to be stronger. This body of research will also benefit from additional studies in other locations. For more information on how the elephant seal data were acquired, see: https://climate.nasa.gov/news/",

    "content": "Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio By Ellen Gray, NASA's Earth Science News Team NASA’s new 3-dimensional portrait of methane concentrations shows the world’s second largest contributor to greenhouse warming, the diversity of sources on the ground, and the behavior of the gas as it moves through the atmosphere. Combining multiple data sets from emissions inventories, including fossil fuel, agricultural, biomass burning and biofuels, and simulations of wetland sources into a high-resolution computer model, researchers now have an additional tool for understanding this complex gas and its role in Earth’s carbon cycle, atmospheric composition, and climate system. Since the Industrial Revolution, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled. After carbon dioxide, methane is the second most influential greenhouse gas, responsible for 20 to 30% of Earth’s rising temperatures to date. “There’s an urgency in understanding where the sources are coming from so that we can be better prepared to mitigate methane emissions where there are opportunities to do so,” said research scientist Ben Poulter at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. A single molecule of methane is more efficient at trapping heat than a molecule of carbon dioxide, but because the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere is shorter and carbon dioxide concentrations are much higher, carbon dioxide still remains the main contributor to climate change. Methane also has many more sources than carbon dioxide, which include the energy and agricultural sectors, as well as natural sources from various types of wetlands and water bodies. “Methane is a gas that’s produced under anaerobic conditions, so that means when there’s no oxygen available, you’ll likely find methane being produced,” said Poulter. In addition to fossil fuel activities, primarily from the coal, oil and gas sectors, sources of methane also include the ocean, flooded soils in vegetated wetlands along rivers and lakes, agriculture, such as rice cultivation, and the stomachs of ruminant livestock, including cattle. “It is estimated that up to 60% of the current methane flux from land to the atmosphere is the result of human activities,” said Abhishek Chatterjee, a carbon cycle scientist with Universities Space Research Association based at Goddard. “Similar to carbon dioxide, human activity over long time periods is increasing atmospheric methane concentrations faster than the removal from natural ‘sinks’ can offset it. As human populations continue to grow, changes in energy use, agriculture and rice cultivation, livestock raising will influence methane emissions. However, it’s difficult to predict future trends due to both lack of measurements and incomplete understanding of the carbon-climate feedbacks.” Researchers are using computer models to try to build a more complete picture of methane, said research meteorologist Lesley Ott with the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at Goddard. “We have pieces that tell us about the emissions, we have pieces that tell us something about the atmospheric concentrations, and the models are basically the missing piece tying all that together and helping us understand where the methane is coming from and where it’s going.” To create a global picture of methane, Ott, Chatterjee, Poulter and their colleagues used methane data from emissions inventories reported by countries, NASA field campaigns, like the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) and observations from the Japanese Space Agency’s Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT Ibuki) and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument aboard the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite. They combined the data sets with a computer model that estimates methane emissions based on known processes for certain land-cover types, such as wetlands. The model also simulates the atmospheric chemistry that breaks down methane and removes it from the air. Then they used a weather model to see how methane traveled and behaved over time while in the atmosphere. The data visualization of their results shows methane’s ethereal movements and illuminates its complexities both in space over various landscapes and with the seasons. Once methane emissions are lofted up into the atmosphere, high-altitude winds can transport it far beyond their sources. When they first saw the data visualized, several locations stood out. In South America, the Amazon River basin and its adjacent wetlands flood seasonally, creating an oxygen-deprived environment that is a significant source of methane. Globally, about 60% of methane emissions come from the tropics, so it’s important to understand the various human and natural sources, said Poulter. Over Europe, the methane signal is not as strong as over the Amazon. European methane sources are influenced by the human population and the exploration and transport of oil, gas and coal from the energy sector. In India, rice cultivation and livestock are the two driving sources of methane. “Agriculture is responsible for about 20% of global methane emissions and includes enteric fermentation, which is the processing of food in the guts of cattle, mainly, but also includes how we manage the waste products that come from livestock and other agricultural activities,” said Poulter. China’s economic expansion and large population drive the high demand for oil, gas and coal exploration for industry as well as agriculture production, which are its underlying sources of methane. The Arctic and high-latitude regions are responsible for about 20% of global methane emissions. “What happens in the Arctic, doesn’t always stay in the Arctic,” Ott said. “There’s a massive amount of carbon that’s stored in the northern high latitudes. One of the things scientists are really concerned about is whether or not, as the soils warm, more of that carbon could be released to the atmosphere. Right now, what you’re seeing in this visualization is not very strong pulses of methane, but we’re watching that very closely because we know that’s a place that is changing rapidly and that could change dramatically over time.” “One of the challenges with understanding the global methane budget has been to reconcile the atmospheric perspective on where we think methane is being produced versus the bottom-up perspective, or how we use country-level reporting or land surface models to estimate methane emissions,” said Poulter. “The visualization that we have here can help us understand this top-down and bottom-up discrepancy and help us also reduce the uncertainties in our understanding of the global methane budget by giving us visual cues and a qualitative understanding of how methane moves around the atmosphere and where it’s produced.” The model data of methane sources and transport will also help in the planning of both future field and satellite missions.

    "content": "10 min read By Samson Reiny,NASA's Earth Science News Team Follow the space agency this summer to learn how NASA investigates fires to improve lives and safeguard the future. NASA satellites reveal a world marked by fire: a global patchwork of flame and smoke driven by the seasons and people. Summer wildfires rage across the western United States and Canada, Australia and Europe. In early spring, agricultural fires blanket the breadbasket regions of Southeast Asia as they do throughout the dry season in central and southern Africa and Brazil. For years, NASA has used the vantage point of space, combined with airborne and ground-based field campaigns, to decipher the impact of fires—from first spark to final puff of smoldering smoke— and help other agencies protect life and property. But the effects of fires linger long after they’re extinguished: They can upend ecosystems, influence climate and disrupt communities. While NASA keeps an eye on today’s fires, it also tackles the big-picture questions that help fire managers plan for the future. This summer, NASA is embarking on several field campaigns across the world to investigate longstanding questions surrounding fire and smoke. Aircraft will fly through smoke and clouds to improve air quality, weather and climate forecasting, and investigate fire-burned forests to capture ecosystem changes that have global impact. Last year’s U.S. wildfire season was the most deadly and costly in California history. It’s become a trend: Longer, hotter dry seasons brought on by climate change combined with superabundant vegetation due to aggressive fire suppression practices over the last century have resulted in 16 of the 20 largest fires in the state’s history occurring in the last 20 years. Under these conditions, early detection is key for disaster responders to formulate strategies for managing wildfires of increasing size and severity and for carrying out evacuations. Instruments on NASA Earth-orbiting satellites often provide the initial snapshot of a fire’s location and progression. “We are, in essence, the tallest fire towers,” said Doug Morton, chief of the biospheric sciences laboratory at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Real-time transfer of those satellite data into the hands of forest managers, protected area managers and firefighters about the locations of new blazes—that’s where NASA’s initial role is critically important.” Ground and airborne observations track daytime fire activity. To track fires at night, the U.S. Forest Service uses two aircraft fitted with NASA-developed thermal sensors and onboard automated data processing systems that deliver fire detection maps via cellular signal to the incident command center (the nerve center for fire operations across responding government agencies) in a matter of a few minutes. “We’re talking about incident command getting crucial information in 5 to 20 minutes versus several hours with older technology,” said Vince Ambrosia, a wildfires remote-sensing scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. “Those numbers speak for themselves on the value of critical, timely information.” In addition to monitoring active fires, NASA is also working to improve fire forecasting. Anticipating a fire’s next move relies on reconciling the complex exchange between topography, vegetation and weather. One area of focus is the development of models that account for moisture content in fuel sources such as desiccated, fallen trees that are more prone to catching fire and spreading it. Another is remote detection of ladder fuels—tall grasses, bushes and tree branches that can carry flames from the ground into higher tree branches to create fast-spreading crown fires. NASA scientists are working to develop maps of ladder fuel for both active fire forecasting and fire mitigation using data from space. Anyone living downwind from a wildfire knows that communities don’t have to be in the direct path of a fire to feel its effects. Smoke can travel thousands of miles, blanketing towns and cities with noxious chemicals and fine particles that cause respiratory distress and other health issues. Regular smoke forecasts for the United States using satellite data are produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather Service. Smoke forecasts are critical to local health managers for planning school and other closures, and for giving communities time to acquire face masks and find suitable shelter. This month, NOAA and NASA begin a major field campaign to improve its ground- and satellite-based forecasting models by taking a closer look at the smoke. The joint Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign will employ a fleet of science aircraft packed with instrumentation for analyzing smoke chemistry at varying altitudes from the point of combustion to hundreds and possibly thousands of miles downwind. The first leg of the mission, which begins in late July, will focus on wildfires in the western United States; the second, in August, will cater to agricultural fires in the U.S southeast. “Not all smoke is the same,” said Barry Lefer, tropospheric composition program manager at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Pine, grasses, deciduous trees, shrubs—their chemistries are different, so when they burn each of those smoke species reacts differently with the weather and atmosphere. We want to observe those interactions and how they change as they travel downwind. This will give more nuance to our models and improve forecasts.” Smoke and cloud interactions have a profound impact on weather and climate. Like other aerosols, smoke particles can act as cloud seeds; water vapor can coalesce around them to form cloud water droplets. Smoke also affects how much sunlight clouds reflect back into the atmosphere. Quantifying these mechanisms is crucial for improving global climate forecast models. Yet aerosol-cloud interactions are notoriously difficult to observe in the field, said Hal Maring, radiation sciences program manager at NASA Headquarters. “Some clouds have very short lifetimes while others have very long ones, and they’re all located in radically different parts of the skies. Getting a quantitative look at these processes is a tall order.” Another major NASA-sponsored field campaign this summer and fall, this time in the Philippines, will tackle this scientific challenge. In August NASA, the Manila Observatory and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), in partnership with the Philippine government, will converge on the skies surrounding the country with several instrumented aircraft, along with the ocean research vessel Sally Ride, to take more than a month’s detailed account of aerosol-cloud interactions. A decade in the making, the Cloud, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) mission will take measurements to help improve monitoring and long-range weather and climate forecasting. The Maritime Continent—Indonesia, Borneo, New Guinea, the Philippine Islands, the Malay Peninsula and the surrounding seas—has long been an area of scientific inquiry. Agricultural and other fires from the region, along with air pollution from cities, provide a ready supply of aerosols that influence major weather processes; besides the torrential monsoons over the Asian archipelago, the region also produces moisture that provides rainfall over the Pacific Ocean and can even influence weather in the continental United States. “The region is the perfect natural laboratory,” said NRL research meteorologist Jeff Reid, who, along with Maring, is co-leading CAMP2Ex. “The region has just the right mixture of meteorological and aerosol variability. Numerous satellite remote sensing and modeling studies have linked the presence of pollution and biomass-burning smoke to changes in cloud and storm properties, but we lack the observations of the actual mechanisms taking place. CAMP2Ex provides a much-needed crucible for satellite observing systems and model predictions to monitor and understand how atmospheric composition and weather interact.” Carbon is a building block for all life on Earth; it’s also a key factor in climate change. Starting from the Industrial Age, the burning of carbon-containing fossil fuels for energy needs has released an excess of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. Forest fires also contribute as they release carbon dioxide. In the northern latitudes there’s another source of carbon emissions that scientists are studying, in the form of thawing soil. In",

    "content": "By Rosemary Sullivant, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory A little extra carbon dioxide in the air may, unfortunately, go further towards warming Earth than previously thought. A team of British and U.S. researchers have uncovered evidence [1] that Earth’s climate may be up to 50 percent more sensitive to long-term increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide than current climate models predict. The reason for the underestimation, they say, may be due to long-term changes in ice sheets and vegetation that are not well represented in today’s global climate models. Just how much will global temperature rise in response to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide? This is one of the key questions that climate scientists need to answer. According to the climate models used in the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels is expected to warm Earth by about 3 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit), once the atmosphere and oceans spend a few years or decades adjusting and reaching a balance. But according to a recent study by a team of researchers that includes Gavin Schmidt of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Earth’s climate is also influenced by other, much slower processes. These include changes in ice sheets, vegetation and aerosols, for example, that take place over hundreds and thousands of years. Because of their complexity and long timescales, these processes are almost impossible to integrate into today’s climate computer models. As a result, it has been difficult to know just what their effect on Earth’s climate sensitivity would be. To learn more about this sensitivity, Schmidt and his co-authors looked back 3 million years into Earth’s past. They used a computer model that describes the oceans and atmosphere to predict, retroactively, the climate of the mid-Pliocene — a period when both global temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were higher than today. The model substantially underestimated just how high temperatures would go. When the researchers adapted the model to include the effects of long-term climate changes in vegetation and ice sheets, they were able to get a much closer representation of the warming in the Pliocene Epoch. The team found that it took much lower concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide to recreate the Pliocene’s warm climate than current models — which consider only the relatively fast-adjusting components of the climate — predict. Pliocene carbon dioxide levels are estimated to have been around 400 parts per million by volume (ppmv), while according to current simulations it would take 500 to 600 ppmv of carbon dioxide to bring about the warm temperatures of the Pliocene. As a result, the researchers estimate that Earth’s response to elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide is 30 to 50 percent greater than previously calculated. In other words, the climate is more sensitive to carbon dioxide than we thought. This higher sensitivity of the climate should be taken into account, the team concludes, when targets are set for limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

High Mountain Asia stores more fresh water in its snow and glaciers than any place on Earth outside the poles, and more than a billion people rely on it for drinking and irrigation. The study team used satellite estimates and modeled precipitation data to project how changing rainfall patterns in the region might affect landslide frequency. The study team found that warming temperatures will cause more intense rainfall in some areas, and this could lead to increased landslide activity in the border region of China and Nepal. More landslides in this region, especially in areas currently covered by glaciers and glacial lakes, could cause cascading disasters like landslide dams and floods that affect areas downstream, sometimes hundreds of miles away, according to the study. The study was a collaboration between scientists from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Washington; and Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

    "content": "7 min read By Samson Reiny,NASA's Earth Science News Team NASA’s DC-8 flying laboratory took to the skies on Monday to kick off a two-month investigation into the life cycles of smoke from fires in the United States. The goal is to better understand smoke impact on weather and climate and provide information that will lead to improved air quality forecasting. A joint campaign led by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) is targeting broad questions about the chemical and physical properties of fire smoke, how it is measured and how it changes from the moment of combustion to its final fate hundreds or thousands of miles downwind. All of these have implications for public health. “Ultimately, our goal is to better understand complex smoke-atmosphere interactions to improve the models for air quality forecasts, leading to increased accuracy and earlier notification, which are critical for communities downwind of fires,” said FIREX-AQ co-investigator Barry Lefer, tropospheric composition program manager at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “That common purpose is what brought our agencies together several years ago when we started planning for this major effort.” “We’ve pulled together an outstanding team of scientists who will be using the most sophisticated suite of instruments and models ever assembled to examine the nature of fires and smoke,” said David Fahey, director of NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Division. “Our long partnership with NASA has taken us literally around the planet and produced too many major scientific discoveries to count. I expect this will be no different.” The first phase of the campaign centers on observing smoke from wildfires in the western United States. Equipped with state-of-the-art remote sensing and in situ instruments, several aircraft based in Boise, Idaho, will work in unison to sample smoke plumes and their changing chemistry along with weather dynamics, tracking the plumes from combustion to destinations often several states away. NASA’s DC-8 flying laboratory—a long-distance-traveling scientific workhorse—will be joined by two NOAA Twin Otters. NASA’s stratosphere-reaching ER-2 aircraft will also be flying out of Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California. In mid-August, the base of operations will move to Salina, Kansas, with flights directed at smoke from agricultural fires in the U.S. southeast. There are hundreds of these fires every year and they are closely situated to population centers, but their small size relative to satellite observational capability means they often go undetected by the satellites that provide the basis for many estimates of smoke emission amounts. The aircraft observations also are critical for understanding small-scale plume dynamics and their scientific impacts. Smoke forecasts are based on several different forecast models that use as inputs satellite and other data, such as the amount of area burned in agricultural fires. NASA and NOAA satellites provide information, such as fuel type, fire intensity and burn scar area, along with wind, temperature and other weather variables, that feed into models that predict smoke amount, direction and speed. Smoke chemistry starts with the fuel type, whether pine forests, oak forests or sage brush. In addition to gases such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, burning will release different types and amounts of short-lived gases called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which combine with other gases and sunlight to produce ground-level ozone—a gas that is harmful to humans and damages crops. Besides fuel type, the temperature of the burn also affects the resulting chemistry; in general, cooler, smoldering fires produce more VOCs, carbon monoxide and particulate matter, all of which are harmful to human health. Hotter, flaming fires produce less VOCs, carbon monoxide and total particulates but more black carbon—an aerosol material with negative health consequences and additional climate warming potential. “What’s burning matters, but how it’s burning matters maybe even more,” said Carsten Warneke, University of Colorado and NOAA mission scientist for FIREX-AQ.

    "content": "5 min read By Joe Atkinson,NASA's Langley Research Center Sea salt, soot, sulfate — probably not the first words that come to mind when you think of clouds. But as these and many other microscopic aerosol particles rise through the atmosphere, they act as nuclei on which water vapor can condense to form cloud droplets. Because different kinds of aerosol particles affect the formation and evolution of clouds in ways that aren't entirely understood, and because more data on that process will help researchers refine climate and weather models, it's a phenomenon ripe for an intensive field study. A new NASA airborne science mission will pick up that gauntlet by taking researchers on coordinated flights above, through and below the clouds over the western North Atlantic Ocean. The Aerosol Cloud Meteorology Interactions Over the Western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) is scheduled to begin the first of six flight campaigns this week at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Using two aircraft, a King Air and an HU-25 Falcon, ACTIVATE scientists will amass nearly 1,200 hours of coordinated flight data over the course of those campaigns. ACTIVATE data will help climate and weather modelers better understand how aerosol particles and meteorological processes affect cloud properties. In addition, modelers will use these data to better characterize how the clouds themselves, in turn, affect aerosol particle properties and atmospheric lifetime as well as the meteorological environment. Two-month-long flight campaigns will be spread out over the next three years, across different seasons and covering a slew of atmospheric conditions. ACTIVATE will focus on marine boundary layer clouds — meaning clouds in the layer of the atmosphere closest to the ocean's surface. Those could range from thin stratiform clouds to thicker, deeper and more convective cumulus clouds. \"One big advantage of the western North Atlantic Ocean is its meteorological set up,\" said Armin Sorooshian, ACTIVATE principal investigator and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona. \"That's one of the important reasons we picked this region. It's got a wide range of weather conditions, which leads to different cloud types.\" Equally important is that it's a region with a rich array of aerosol particles on which cloud droplets can form. Some of the possible aerosol sources include smoke from agricultural fires and wildfires in the U.S. and Canada; biogenic emissions from plants, trees and ocean-dwelling microorganisms; urban outflow from cities on the East Coast; and even dust blown over from the Sahara Desert. The coordinated flights will measure these aerosol particles and cloud processes from just about every imaginable angle. The Falcon will fly under and through the clouds, where a suite of instruments will take samples directly from the surrounding air to measure everything from aerosol properties to droplet composition to gas concentrations. Up above the clouds, researchers on the King Air will employ two remote sensors — an active sensor that fires a pulsed laser and measures a vertical profile of the atmosphere, and a passive sensor that measures light scattering from the sun at many different angles and wavelengths. These complementary measurements provide properties of cloud droplets and aerosol particles, such as the size and number concentration. In addition, researchers will use dropsondes to measure atmospheric conditions such as humidity, temperature, air pressure and winds. Dropsondes are small instruments that are ejected from a tube in the aircraft and take readings as they parachute through the atmosphere. \"Although it is more challenging to coordinate and execute, using a two-aircraft approach offers a unique opportunity to sample both the horizontal and vertical changes in the aerosol-cloud system simultaneously,\" said John Hair, ACTIVATE project scientist at Langley. \"In addition, with this approach, we expect the abundance of planned flights to sample a range of atmospheric conditions and aerosol types that will reveal how weather processes and aerosol particles impact the formation, size and lifetime of cloud droplets.\" Through this coordinated flight approach laser focused on one particular region of the planet that offers a rich variety of meteorological and aerosol conditions, ACTIVATE scientists plan to build an unprecedented catalog of data that will fill an important gap in the knowledge of climate and weather forecasters. \"To my knowledge there's never been a campaign or a mission of this magnitude that has focused so much on just building statistics in one region,\" said Sorooshian. \"The data we collect will be a treasure trove for modelers, who need this kind of information to better evaluate the effects of differing atmospheric conditions on model outcomes.\" The ACTIVATE science team includes researchers from NASA, the National Institute of Aerospace, universities, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the German Aerospace Center.

Credit: NASA To make better predictions about the future impacts of sea level rise, new techniques are being developed to fill gaps in the historic record of sea level measurements. We know the factors that play a role in sea level rise: Melting glaciers and ice sheets add water to the seas, and warmer temperatures cause water to expand. Other factors are known to slow the rise, such as dams impounding water on the land, stymying its flow into the sea. When each factor is added together, this estimate should match the sea level that scientists observe. Until now, however, the sea level \"budget\" has fallen short of the observed sea level rise, leading scientists to question why the budget wouldn't balance. A new study published on Aug. 19 seeks to balance this budget. By gaining new insights to historic measurements, scientists can better forecast how each of these factors will affect sea level rise and how this rise will impact us in the future. For example, in its recent flooding report, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) noted a rapid increase in sea level rise-related flooding events along U.S. coasts over the last 20 years, and they are expected to grow in extent, frequency, and depth as sea levels continue to rise.

Previous maps only focused on the size of a forest. These maps show forest quality as a single measurement, taking into account information like the height of trees, thickness of the forest canopy, and if logging, fire or a similar disturbance occurred. \"Now we have maps that show not just where the forests are located, but the ecological quality of those forests,\" said lead author Andrew Hansen of Montana State University. \"That's important because it allows policymakers to prioritize forests that have the highest value in terms of biodiversity, carbon storage, and water yield,\" Hansen said. About half of the world's humid tropical forests could be considered of \"high quality,\" according to the study published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. The study was supported the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Wildlife Conservation Society and other leading research institutions. Only 6.5% of these high-quality forests have formal protections, said Hansen. With their low levels of human pressure, large trees and thick canopy vegetation, these forests act as key habitats for many plants and animals, which fosters biodiversity. They also help stabilize the climate worldwide by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The paper's authors note where these high-quality forests are at risk and include a conservation framework that recommends ways to protect existing forests as well as restoring others. One way to restore the quality of forests is increasing the number of species that live there by strengthening protections like limiting hunting and reducing invasive species, Hansen said. \"Another way is restoring forest structure,\" he added. \"Grow taller forests with more canopy layers for example.\" Most of the high-quality forests mapped in the study are located in remote areas of the Amazon and Congo. \"The key advance here was remote sensing,\" Hansen said, adding that Earth observations now make it possible to measure details like forest height and vegetation in far greater detail than ever before. The team combined precise measurements of the height of vegetation on the Earth's surface from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) with the main data set for the work, the decades-long record collected by the Landsat series of satellites, an Earth-observing mission developed in partnership between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey. \"It's a globally consistent, fine-scale measurement of forest structure and allows identification of taller, older and more closed-canopy humid tropical forests,\" Hansen said. By combining that information with measurements of human activity, the team developed their overall index of forest quality. Woody Turner is the lead of the Earth Sciences Ecological Forecasting program area, which funds the project. \"NASA is making great strides in bringing together imagery from multiple Earth observation satellites with measurements of human activity and other on-the-ground data,\" he said. \"The trick is to get very different types of data, often captured at different spatial scales, into a common framework for a soup-to-nuts approach needed to address some of these global issues.\" In",

Credit: NESDIS By Jenny Marder, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Every evening from late spring to early fall, two planes lift off from airports in the western United States and fly through the sunset, each headed for an active wildfire, and then another, and another. From 10,000 feet above ground, the pilots can spot the glow of a fire, and occasionally the smoke enters the cabin, burning the eyes and throat. The pilots fly a straight line over the flames, then U-turn and fly back in an adjacent but overlapping path, like they’re mowing a lawn. When fire activity is at its peak, it’s not uncommon for the crew to map 30 fires in one night. The resulting aerial view of the country’s most dangerous wildfires helps establish the edges of those fires and identify areas thick with flames, scattered fires and isolated hotspots. A large global constellation of satellites, operated by NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), combined with a small fleet of planes operated by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) help detect and map the extent, spread and impact of forest fires. As technology has advanced, so has the value of remote sensing, the science of scanning the Earth from a distance using satellites and high-flying airplanes. The most immediate, life-or-death decisions in fighting forest fires – sending smokejumpers to a ridge, for example, or calling an evacuation order when flames leap a river – are made by firefighters and chiefs in command centers and on the fire line. Data from satellites and aircraft provide situational awareness with a strategic, big-picture view. “We use the satellites to inform decisions on where to stage assets across the country,” said Brad Quayle of the Forest Service’sGeospatial Technology and Applications Center, which plays a key role in providing remote-sensing data for active wildfire suppression. “When there’s high competition for firefighters, tankers and aircraft, decisions have to be made on how to distribute those assets.” It’s not uncommon for an Earth-observing satellite to be the first to detect a wildfire, especially in remote regions like the Alaskan wilderness. And at the height of the fire season, when there are more fires than planes to map them, data from satellites are used to estimate the fire’s evolution, capturing burned areas, the changing perimeter and potential damage, like in the case of Montana’s Howe Ridge Fire, which burned for nearly two months in Glacier National Park last summer.

Credit: Bert Kaufmann/CC BY-SA › Larger view A new NASA/university study of carbon dioxide emissions for 20 major cities around the world provides the first direct, satellite-based evidence that as a city's population density increases, the carbon dioxide it emits per person declines, with some notable exceptions. The study also demonstrates how satellite measurements of this powerful greenhouse gas can give fast-growing cities new tools to track carbon dioxide emissions and assess the impact of policy changes and infrastructure improvements on their energy efficiency. Cities account for more than 70 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy production, and rapid, ongoing urbanization is increasing their number and size. But some densely populated cities emit more carbon dioxide per capita than others. To better understand why, atmospheric scientists Dien Wu and John Lin of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City teamed with colleagues at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; Universities Space Research Association (USRA) in Columbia, Maryland; and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. They calculated per capita carbon dioxide emissions for 20 urban areas on several continents using recently available carbon dioxide estimates from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite, managed by the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Cities spanning a range of population densities were selected based on the quality and quantity of OCO-2 data available for them. Cities with minimal vegetation were preferred because plants can absorb and emit carbon dioxide, complicating the interpretation of the measurements. Two U.S. cities were included: Las Vegas and Phoenix. Many scientists and policy makers have assumed the best way to estimate and understand differences in carbon dioxide emissions in major cities is to employ a \"bottom-up\" approach, compiling an inventory of fossil fuel emissions produced by industrial facilities, farms, road transport and power plants. The bottom-up method was the only feasible approach before remote-sensing data sets became available. This approach can provide estimates of emissions by fuel type (coal, oil, natural gas) and sector (power generation, transportation, manufacturing) but can miss some emissions, especially in rapidly developing urban areas. But for this study, researchers instead employed a \"top-down\" approach to inventory emissions, using satellite-derived estimates of the amount of carbon dioxide present in the air above an urban area as the satellite flies overhead. \"Other people have used fuel statistics, the number of miles driven by a person or how big people's houses are to calculate per capita emissions,\" Lin said. \"We're looking down from space to actually measure the carbon dioxide concentration over a city.\" Published Feb. 20 in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the study found that cities with higher population densities generally have lower per capita carbon dioxide emissions, in line with previous bottom-up studies based on emissions inventories. But the satellite data provided new insights. \"Our motivating question was essentially: When people live in denser cities, do they emit less carbon dioxide? The general answer from our analysis suggests, yes, emissions from denser cities are lower,\" said Eric Kort, principal investigator and associate professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan. \"It isn't a complete picture, since we only see local direct emissions, but our study does provide an alternative direct observational assessment that was entirely missing before.\" Scientists have hypothesized that more densely-populated urban areas generally emit less carbon dioxide per person because they are more energy efficient: That is, less energy per person is needed in these areas because of factors like the use of public transportation and the efficient heating and cooling of multi-family dwellings. Satellite data can improve our understanding of this relationship because they describe the combined emissions from all sources. This information can be incorporated with more source-specific, bottom-up inventories to help city managers plan for more energy-efficient growth and develop better estimates of future carbon dioxide emissions. The OCO-2 data show that not all densely-populated urban areas have lower per capita emissions, however. Cities with major power generation facilities, such as Yinchuan, China, and Johannesburg, had higher emissions than what their population density would otherwise suggest. \"The satellite detects the carbon dioxide plume at the power plant, not at the city that actually uses the power,\" Lin said. \"Some cities don't produce as much carbon dioxide, given their population density, but they consume goods and services that would give rise to carbon dioxide emissions elsewhere,\" Wu added. Another exception to the higher population density/lower emissions observation is affluence. A wealthy urban area, like Phoenix, produces more emissions per capita than a developing city like Hyderabad, India, which has a similar population density. The researchers speculate that Phoenix's higher per capita emissions are due to factors such as higher rates of driving and larger, better air-conditioned homes. The researchers stress there's much more to be learned about urban carbon dioxide emissions. They believe new data from OCO-2's successor, OCO-3 — which launched to the International Space Station last year — along with future space-based carbon dioxide-observing missions, may shed light on potential solutions to mitigating cities' carbon emissions. \"Many people are interested in carbon dioxide emissions from large cities,\" Wu said. \"Additionally, there are a few places with high emissions that aren't necessarily related to population. Satellites can detect and quantify emissions from those locations around the globe.\" Launched in",

The OASIS study project seeks to establish a mission that would find and examine those aquifers. Credit: NASA Earth's driest ecosystems are a study in extremes: They can be blazingly hot stretches of sand like the Sahara Desert or shatteringly cold expanses of ice such as those in Greenland and Antarctica. These arid regions receive very little annual precipitation, and the effects of climate change in these ecosystems are poorly understood. A joint effort between NASA and the Qatar Foundation aims to address that - and, in the process, help communities that are being impacted by those changes. Researchers with the Orbiting Arid Subsurfaces and Ice Sheet Sounder (OASIS) study project are designing a satellite mission to probe the sand dunes and ice sheets of some of Earth's driest places with radar technology similar to that used by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The project's primary goal would be to discover and monitor underground sources of fresh water called aquifers. Many aquifers in the deserts of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, among others, are being rapidly depleted to support the needs of local communities. Get a Monthly Digest of NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » At the same time, aquifers in coastal regions are being threatened by sea level rise caused by the melting of ice sheets in places like Greenland. If the salt water from rising seas contaminates the fresh water in aquifers, it would affect not only drinking water but also regional agriculture and food security. A secondary goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of how melting ice sheets contribute to rising seas. Under a reimbursable Space Act Agreement with NASA and the Qatar Foundation (QF) for Science, Education & Community Development - represented by Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) and the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) at HBKU - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and QEERI will jointly formulate a mission concept study for Qatar's prospective OASIS mission. The project seeks to put a satellite in Earth orbit to map the distribution of shallow aquifers beneath the desert's surface in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Scientists plan to use the satellite's radar instrument to study how those aquifers originated and how groundwater moves beneath the deserts through a complex system of subsurface fractures that spread out like a spiderweb between aquifers. Data collected in the process would help with aquifer management. \"The scientific community is excited about this mission. OASIS would be the first spaceborne radar specifically designed to detect directly subsurface water on Earth,\" said James Graf, director for Earth Science and Technology at JPL in Southern California. Project researchers also intend to study the topography of the land under ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to determine such properties as ice sheet thickness and the pathways by which ice flows to the ocean. This information could feed into models of current and future ice sheet responses to climate change, which would help researchers better understand ice sheet contributions to sea level rise. \"Warm and cold deserts are responding to climatic changes by expanding and shrinking, respectively,\" said Essam Heggy, the OASIS principal investigator and chief scientist and research program director of the Earth Science Program at QEERI. \"Studying the forces driving these transformations will give us insight into the evolution of deserts on Earth.\" In a decadal survey identifying Earth science areas of focus between",

Using satellite images to track global tundra ecosystems over decades, a new study found the region has become greener as warmer air and soil temperatures lead to increased plant growth. “The Arctic tundra is one of the coldest biomes on Earth, and it’s also one of the most rapidly warming,” said Logan Berner, a global change ecologist with Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, who led the recent research. “This Arctic greening we see is really a bellwether of global climatic change – it’s a biome-scale response to rising air temperatures.” The study, published last week in Nature Communications, is the first to measure vegetation changes spanning the entire Arctic tundra, from Alaska and Canada to Siberia, using satellite data from Landsat, a joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Other studies have used the satellite data to look at smaller regions, since Landsat data can be used to determine how much actively growing vegetation is on the ground. Greening can represent plants growing more, becoming denser, and/or shrubs encroaching on typical tundra grasses and moss. When the tundra vegetation changes, it impacts not only the wildlife that depend on certain plants, but also the people who live in the region and depend on local ecosystems for food. While active plants will absorb more carbon from the atmosphere, the warming temperatures could also be thawing permafrost, thereby releasing greenhouse gases. The research is part of NASA’s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), which aims to better understand how ecosystems are responding in these warming environments and the broader social implications. Berner and his colleagues used the Landsat data and additional calculations to estimate the peak greenness for a given year for each of 50,000 randomly selected sites across the tundra. Between",

This scene stretches from the green forest vegetation and wet climates of the Atlantic coast to the almost vegetation-less landscapes of the Sahara Desert. Credit: NASA By Jessica Merzdorf, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Scientists from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and international collaborators demonstrated a new method for mapping the location and size of trees growing outside of forests, discovering billions of trees in arid and semi-arid regions and laying the groundwork for more accurate global measurement of carbon storage on land. Using powerful supercomputers and machine learning algorithms, the team mapped the crown diameter – the width of a tree when viewed from above – of more than 1.8 billion trees across an area of more than 500,000 square miles, or 1,300,000 square kilometers. The team mapped how tree crown diameter, coverage, and density varied depending on rainfall and land use. Mapping non-forest trees at this level of detail would take months or years with traditional analysis methods, the team said, compared to a few weeks for this study. The use of very high-resolution imagery and powerful artificial intelligence represents a technology breakthrough for mapping and measuring these trees. This study is intended to be the first in a series of papers whose goal is not only to map non-forest trees across a wide area, but also to calculate how much carbon they store – vital information for understanding the Earth’s carbon cycle and how it is changing over time. Carbon is one of the primary building blocks for all life on Earth, and this element circulates among the land, atmosphere, and oceans via the carbon cycle. Some natural processes and human activities release carbon into the atmosphere, while other processes draw it out of the atmosphere and store it on land or in the ocean. Trees and other green vegetation are carbon “sinks,” meaning they use carbon for growth and store it out of the atmosphere in their trunks, branches, leaves and roots. Human activities, like burning trees and fossil fuels or clearing forested land, release carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, and rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are a main cause of climate change. Conservation experts working to mitigate climate change and other environmental threats have targeted deforestation for years, but these efforts do not always include trees that grow outside forests, said Compton Tucker, senior biospheric scientist in the Earth Sciences Division at NASA Goddard. Not only could these trees be significant carbon sinks, but they also contribute to the ecosystems and economies of nearby human, animal and plant populations. However, many current methods for studying trees’ carbon content only include forests, not trees that grow individually or in small clusters. Tucker and his NASA colleagues, together with an international team, used commercial satellite images from DigitalGlobe, which were high-resolution enough to spot individual trees and measure their crown size. The images came from the commercial QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites. The team focused on the dryland regions – areas that receive less precipitation than what evaporates from plants each year – including the arid south side of the Sahara Desert, that stretches through the semi-arid Sahel Zone and into the humid sub-tropics of West Africa. By studying a variety of landscapes from few trees to nearly forested conditions, the team trained their computing algorithms to recognize trees across diverse terrain types, from deserts in the north to tree savannas in the south. The team ran a powerful computing algorithm called a fully convolutional neural network (“deep learning”) on the University of Illinois’ Blue Waters, one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. The team trained the model by manually marking nearly 90,000 individual trees across a variety of terrain, then allowing it to “learn” which shapes and shadows indicated the presence of trees. The process of coding the training data took more than a year, said Martin Brandt, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Copenhagen and the study’s lead author. Brandt marked all 89,899 trees by himself and helped supervise training and running the model. Ankit Kariryaa of the University of Bremen led the development of the deep learning computer processing. “In one kilometer of terrain, say it’s a desert, many times there are no trees, but the program wants to find a tree,” Brandt said. “It will find a stone, and think it’s a tree. Further south, it will find houses that look like trees. It sounds easy, you’d think – there’s a tree, why shouldn’t the model know it’s a tree? But the challenges come with this level of detail. The more detail there is, the more challenges come.” Get a Monthly Digest of NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » Establishing an accurate count of trees in this area provides vital information for researchers, policymakers and conservationists. Additionally, measuring how tree size and density vary by rainfall – with wetter and more populated regions supporting more and larger trees – provides important data for on-the-ground conservation efforts. “There are important ecological processes, not only inside, but outside forests too,” said Jesse Meyer, a programmer at NASA Goddard who led the processing on Blue Waters. “For preservation, restoration, climate change, and other purposes, data like these are very important to establish a baseline. In a year or two or ten, the study could be repeated with new data and compared to data from today, to see if efforts to revitalize and reduce deforestation are effective or not. It has quite practical implications.” After gauging the program’s accuracy by comparing it to both manually coded data and field data from the region, the team ran the program across the full study area. The neural network identified more than 1.8 billion trees – surprising numbers for a region often assumed to support little vegetation, said Meyer and Tucker. “Future papers in the series will build on the foundation of counting trees, extend the areas studied, and look ways to calculate their carbon content,” said Tucker. NASA missions like the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation mission, or GEDI, and ICESat-2, or the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2, are already collecting data that will be used to measure the height and biomass of forests. In the future, combining these data sources with the power of artificial intelligence could open up new research possibilities. “Our objective is to see how much carbon is in isolated trees in the vast arid and semi-arid portions of the world,” Tucker said. “Then we need to understand the mechanism which drives carbon storage in arid and semi-arid areas. Perhaps this information can be utilized to store more carbon in vegetation by taking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.” “From a carbon cycle perspective, these dry areas are not well mapped, in terms of what density of trees and carbon is there,” Brandt said. “It’s a white area on maps. These dry areas are basically masked out. This is because normal satellites just don’t see the trees – they see a forest, but if the tree is isolated, they can’t see it. Now we’re on the way to filling these white spots on the maps. And that’s quite exciting.” This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

The team was tasked with collecting ground data to verify the accuracy of measurements made by the IceSat-2 satellite. Credit: NASA / Kelly Brunt By Esprit Smith, NASA's Earth Science News Team When an ice cube is exposed to a heat source, like warm water or air, it melts. So, it's no surprise that a warming climate is causing our glaciers and ice sheets to melt. However, predicting just how much the glaciers and ice sheets will melt and how quickly – key components of sea level rise – is not nearly as straightforward. Glaciers and ice sheets are far more complex structures than ice cubes. They form when snow accumulates and is compressed into ice by new snow over many years. As they grow, they begin to move slowly under the pressure of their own weight, dragging smaller rocks and debris across the land with them. Glacial ice that extends to cover large landmasses, as it does in Antarctica and Greenland, is considered an ice sheet. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » The processes that cause glaciers and ice sheets to lose mass are also more complex. An ice cube's surface melts when it's exposed to ambient (warm) air. And while warm air certainly melts the surface of glaciers and ice sheets, they're also significantly affected by other factors including the ocean water that surrounds them, the terrain (both land and ocean) over which they move, and even their own meltwater. Greenland and Antarctica are home to most of the world's glacial ice, including its only two ice sheets. These thick slabs of ice – some 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) and 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) thick, respectively – contain most of the freshwater stored on Earth, making them of particular interest to scientists. Combined, the two regions also contain enough ice that, if it were to melt all at once, would raise sea levels by nearly 215 feet (65 meters) – making the study and understanding of them not just interesting, but crucial to our near-term adaptability and our long-term survival in a changing world. A glacier is considered \"in balance\" when the amount of snow that falls and accumulates at its surface (the accumulation zone) is equal to the amount of ice lost through melting, evaporation, calving and other processes. But with annual air temperatures in the Arctic increasing faster than anywhere else in the world, that balance is no longer achievable in Greenland. Warmer ocean waters surrounding the island's tidewater glaciers are also problematic. \"It's basically like pointing a hairdryer at an ice cube, while the ice cube is also sitting in a warm pot of water,\" said Josh Willis, principal investigator of NASA's Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG), a project that is investigating the effects of ocean water temperature on melting ice in the region. \"The glaciers are being melted by heat from above and below simultaneously.\" Although the warm air and the warm water contribute to melting individually, the interplay between the meltwater from the glacier and the warm ocean water also plays a significant role. When warm summer air melts the surface of a glacier, the meltwater bores holes down through the ice. It makes its way all the way down to the bottom of the glacier where it runs between the ice and the glacier bed, and eventually shoots out in a plume at the glacier base and into the surrounding ocean. The meltwater plume is lighter than the surrounding ocean water because it doesn't contain salt. So it rises toward the surface, mixing the warm ocean water upward in the process. The warm water then rubs up against the bottom of the glacier, causing even more of the glacier to melt. This often leads to calving – ice cracking and breaking off into large ice chunks (icebergs) – at the front end, or terminus, of the glacier. The complicated shape of the sea floor surrounding Greenland influences how readily this warm water melt can occur. It provides a barrier in some areas – preventing the deep, warmer water from the Atlantic Ocean from reaching glacier fronts. However, the underwater terrain, much like the terrain above water, includes other features like deep canyons. The canyons cut into the continental shelf, allowing the Atlantic waters in. Glaciers sitting in these waters will melt faster than those where the warm water is blocked by underwater ridges or sills. In Antarctica, where similar surface and ocean melting processes occur, the topography and bedrock on which the ice sheet sits significantly influence the ice sheet's stability and its contribution to sea level rise. Researchers separate Antarctica into two regions based on the relationship between the ice and the bedrock beneath it. East Antarctica, the area east of the Transantarctic Mountains, is extremely high in elevation and has the thickest ice on the planet. The bedrock underneath the ice sheet is also mostly above sea level. These features help to keep the east side relatively stable. West Antarctica, on the other hand, is lower in elevation and most of the ice sheet there is thinner. Unlike the east, the ice sheet in West Antarctica sits on bedrock that is below sea level. \"In West Antarctica, we have these glaciers resting on bedrock that is under water. Like in Greenland, there is a layer of warmer ocean water below the cold surface layer. So this warm water is able to flow onto the continental shelf, and then all the way underneath the ice shelves – the floating ice that extends from glaciers and the ice sheet,” said NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Helene Seroussi. “The water melts the ice shelves from below, which can cause them to thin and break off.\" That matters because the ice shelves act like corks. They hold back the ice that is flowing from upstream, slowing its approach to the ocean where it raises sea level. When the ice shelves calve, the cork is essentially removed, allowing more inland ice to flow freely into the ocean. Furthermore, this leads to retreat of the grounding zone – the area where the ice separates from the bedrock and begins to float. \"The grounding zone delineates floating ice, which is already accounted for in the sea level budget from grounded ice which is not accounted for in the budget,\" said ICESat-2 scientist Kelly Brunt of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland. \"Floating ice is like an ice cube floating in a glass. It doesn't overflow the glass when it melts. But when non-floating ice is added to the ocean, it's like adding more ice cubes to the glass which will cause the water level to rise.\" The bedrock in West Antarctica is also reverse sloping – meaning it is higher at the edges and gradually becomes deeper further inland. So each time the grounding zone retreats inland, thicker ice is exposed to the ocean water and the glacier or ice sheet becomes grounded in deeper water. This allows even more ice to flow from upstream into the ocean. \"It's concerning in West Antarctica because as we push the grounding zones back, the downward, reverse slope means that there's really no backstop, nothing to interrupt this cycle of melting and retreat,\" said Brunt. \"Our maps of the bedrock under the ice sheet are not as comprehensive as they are in Greenland, in part because Antarctica is far less accessible. Because of that, we really don't know if there are any little bumps or peaks down there that might help to slow the retreat.\" West Antarctic glaciers like Thwaites and Pine Island are already retreating faster than they were in the past. This is problematic because they provide a main pathway for ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to enter the Amundsen Sea and raise sea levels. Overall, melting and ice loss have accelerated at both poles in recent years. The more we learn about the processes and interactions that cause it, some of which were discussed here, the better we'll be able to accurately and precisely predict sea level rise far into the future.

Credit: Michael Bogner / Adobe Stock By Pat Brennan, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Burning fossil fuels in densely populated regions greatly increases the level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The largest carbon dioxide sources are cars, trucks, ports, power generation, and industry, including manufacturing. Urban greenery adds CO2 to the atmosphere when vegetation dies and decomposes, increasing total emissions. Urban vegetation also removes this gas from the atmosphere when it photosynthesizes, causing total measured emissions to drop. Understanding the role of urban vegetation is important for managing cities' green spaces and tracking the effects of other carbon sources. A recently published study showed that among the overall sources of carbon dioxide in urban environments, a fraction is from decaying trees, lawns, and other urban vegetation. The contribution is modest - about one-fifth of the measured CO2 contributed by the urban environment - and varies seasonally. This was more than researchers anticipated and underscores the complexity of tracking urban carbon emissions. The team behind the study made this discovery by tracing carbon dioxide sources with carbon-14, a rare form of carbon that occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere and is absorbed by living things as they grow. Carbon-14's presence in organic materials is the basis of radiocarbon dating and serves as a powerful tool to distinguish the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel combustion from that produced by decomposing vegetation and other organic matter. The carbon found in coal, oil, and natural gas is hundreds of millions of years old; all of its carbon-14 decayed long ago. The researchers measured levels of \"excess\" carbon dioxide, or the amount that's above what can be attributed to natural, background sources. Focusing on the \"Los Angeles megacity\" - a multicity region encompassing nearly 6,000 square miles (15,000 square kilometers) and 18 million people - they found that, over the course of a year, urban greenery accounts for about one-fifth of the excess carbon dioxide observed in the air over the study area.

    "content": "The Earth is a bit like the human body; its temperature is very finely balanced, and when it gets slightly out of whack big things can happen. In the case of our home planet, gases in the atmosphere play a vital role in maintaining this delicate equilibrium, by balancing the absorption and emission of all the electromagnetic radiation (microwaves, infrared waves, ultraviolet light and visible light, for example) reaching the surface of the Earth. As we reported recently, the Earth is getting warmer. Scientists believe the main driver behind this warming trend is rising levels of man-made greenhouse gases; these gases, which we pump out into the air, act to trap heat radiation near the surface of the Earth that would otherwise be sent back out into space. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the Paris Hilton of greenhouse gases, and gets a lot of face time because its concentration in the atmosphere has increased relatively rapidly since the Industrial Revolution. But methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are also important agents of global warming — some of them are actually much more potent than CO2 and they stick around for hundreds to thousands of years longer. This has some scientists concerned that these B-listers could actually impact global temperatures significantly more than CO2. In a new paper, Partha Bera and colleagues at NASA Ames Research Center and Purdue University put these gases under the microscope to find out exactly why they are such powerful heat trappers. They focus on CFCs, HFCs and PFCs — all chemicals containing the atoms fluorine or chlorine — that are used in medicine, fridges and as solvents, among other things. By probing the molecular structure of these compounds, they have found that molecules containing several fluorine atoms are especially strong greenhouse gases, for two reasons. First, unlike many other atmospheric molecules, they can absorb radiation that makes it through our atmosphere from space. Second, they absorb the radiation (trap the heat) very efficiently, because of the nature of the fluorine bonds inside them. (In technical terms, fluorine atoms create a larger separation of electric charge within the molecule, and this helps the molecular bonds absorb electromagnetic radiation more effectively.) HFCs and other fluorine-based gases have been called “the worst greenhouse gases you’ve never heard of.” Now we know why. Until now, scientists had not looked in detail at the underlying physical or chemical causes that make some molecules better global warmers than others. Bera and colleagues say that their work should help improve our “understanding [of] the physical characteristics of greenhouse gases, and specifically what makes an efficient greenhouse gas on a molecular level.” They hope their findings will be used by industry to develop more environmentally-friendly materials.

Matt has just returned a student climate change conference in Thailand. Stepping off the plane in Phuket, Thailand after leaving some thirty hours before from Colorado was quite a temperature shock. Having just crunched through the snow on my front porch, I was now in the tropics, attending the Climate Change Education and Earth System Science workshop representing the CloudSat Education Network. CloudSat, NASA’s cloud-watching satellite mission, has several schools in Thailand engaged in cloud observations, which we use to calibrate CloudSat data products. I had planned to hold a two-day, pre-conference workshop where I would work with students and teachers on understanding the basics of clouds and climate change. Little did I know, standing there in the hot Phuket sun, exactly how much science I would be looking at in the days to come. The workshop went great. Nearly fifty students aged 12-18 from all over Thailand attended, and with the help of graduate students and faculty from nearby Walailak University, who were hosting the conference in conjunction with the Thai Institute for the Promotion of Teaching of Science and Technology (IPST), we spent the two days going through a whirlwind of science topics. We answered questions about climate change and developed new strategies for students to do science research, both in Thailand and in partnership with our CloudSat-affiliated schools in the U.S. Then, the conference started — nearly 200 students and teachers, presenting research from the last year. The spectrum of topics was incredible. They ranged from investigating the effect of clouds on radio transmission to developing techniques to estimate the amount of rainfall using CloudSat data (and validating their results using rain measurement gauges!). Students had tracked the effect of ground cover on rubber tree cultivation and had studied the increasingly earlier budburst of local flowering trees, which they linked to local climate change in their province. They are engaged in relevant and cutting-edge climate research, and the results they are obtaining are astonishing. I've made many new friends in the last couple of days, renewed old friendships and watched in wonder as student scientists take the lead in important climate research. I know that these kids are walking away from this conference with a greater understanding of how we observe the Earth and its climate from space, but I also know that I leave this place with a wealth of knowledge gained by listening to the next generation of scientists presenting their research. And based on what I've seen in here in Thailand, the future is a bright one indeed. --Matt Rogers This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

Natural cycles such as El Niño and La Niña events cause this sea level seesaw to tip back and forth, with the ocean near Asia on one end and the ocean near the Americas on the other. But over the last 30 years, the seesaw’s wobbles have been more extreme, causing variations in sea levels up to three times higher than those observed in the previous 30 years. Why might this be? A new NASA/university study has found the differing alignments of two separate climate cycles could be causing these intensifying swings, which occur on top of a global rise in sea level due to melting ice sheets and warming oceans. The findings may help improve forecasts of sea level variations, allowing vulnerable coastal communities to prepare for their increased risk of flooding, erosion and other damage due to higher sea levels. Tony Song of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and colleagues looked at the correlations of tropical Pacific sea level with different phases of two important climatic cycles: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (see sidebar).

I remember when I saw \"The Day After Tomorrow\" in the theater; I actually thought it was pretty cool. Of course, a lot of my nerdy scientist friends complained that it was inaccurate and that it blew climate change all out of proportion. It did, of course. But I thought it was pretty neat to see a Hollywood disaster movie where the disaster was caused by the disruption of a well-known, real-life set of ocean currents called the “Ocean Conveyor Belt.” Well, okay, we scientists call it the “Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,” but I give Hollywood points for doing a bit of homework. In the movie, our hero Dennis Quaid notices that all the ice in Greenland is about to melt and run into the Atlantic Ocean. He (rightly) notes that such an event would slow down or stop the Ocean Conveyor Belt, and then predicts that it will wreak havoc on the global climate. Of course, the movie vastly exaggerates the importance of the Conveyor Belt and the speed with which any changes might occur, but it turns out that the basic idea was based on actual research. Climate scientists who study the most recent ice age have suggested that the Ocean Conveyor Belt might have played a role in rapid cooling events that occurred tens of thousands of years ago throughout the last ice age. Today’s climate is much warmer, and the effect of the Conveyor Belt is probably not as dramatic as it was back then. But global warming is predicted to slow down the Conveyor Belt in the coming decades. If it does, then patterns of rainfall, drought and even hurricane activity in the Atlantic could be affected. That’s why oceanographers have been scrambling to figure out how best to measure this thing we call the Conveyor Belt. You can imagine then, how excited I was when I figured out that I could see changes in the Conveyor Belt using data from ocean satellites and floats. So far, it looks like the predicted slowing hasn’t started yet. That’s probably not too surprising, as the oceans are slow to respond to global climate change. But it’s still pretty neat to imagine how the oceans could play such an important role in Earth’s climate. Not only do they absorb most of the extra heat from global warming, they might also play a role in shifting rainfall patterns and fueling storms. That’s one of the reasons I liked \"The Day After Tomorrow.\" Even though it was unrealistic, the movie reminds us that the ocean is the Big Kahuna when it comes to global warming.

The research could help predict how much the Greenland Ice Sheet will contribute to future sea level rise in the next century, a number that currently ranges from inches to feet. “There are glaciers that popped up in our study that flew under the radar until now,” said lead author Denis Felikson, a graduate research assistant at The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) and a Ph.D. student in The University of Texas Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. Felikson’s study was published in Nature Geoscience on April 17. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second largest ice sheet on Earth and has been losing mass for decades, a trend scientists have linked to a warming climate. However, the mass change experienced by individual coastal glaciers, which flow out from the ice sheet into the ocean, is highly variable. This makes predicting the impact on future sea-level rise difficult. “We were looking for a way to explain why this variability exists, and we found a way to do it that has never been applied before on this scale,” Felikson said. Of the 16 glaciers researchers investigated in West Greenland, the study found four that are the most susceptible to thinning: Rink Isbrae, Umiamako Isbrae, Jakobshavn Isbrae and Sermeq Silardleq. Umiamako Isbrae, Sermeq Silardleq and Jakobshavn Isbrae are already losing mass, with Jakobshavn being responsible for more than 81 percent of West Greenland’s total mass loss over the past 30 years.

Or you can melt the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and trace rising seas as they inundate the Florida coast. Computer models are critical tools for understanding the future of a changing planet, including melting ice, rising seas and shifting precipitation patterns. But typically, these mathematical representations — long chains of computer code giving rise to images of dynamic change — are accessible mainly to scientists. The new simulator, however, allows anyone with a computer to perform idealized experiments with sea level and learn about its complexities. Developed by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the interactive platform, called the Virtual Earth System Laboratory (VESL), provides the public with a taste of how NASA models important Earth processes. The platform will also prove useful to scientists as a convenient way to create visual representations of data. While many interface tools are available to explore sea level effects, VESL stands apart for its strong representation of Earth's cryosphere - the melting ice caps, ice sheets and glaciers that are major contributors to sea level rise. And the simulator is not just a simplified version of a model or a menu of preexisting results. It is direct access to the complex, number-crunching model itself, though with limited scenarios and factors that can be adjusted. \"It's the real software, being used on the fly, live, without being prerecorded or precomputed,\" said Eric Larour of JPL, who led VESL's development. \"You have access to a segment of an ice sheet model or sea level model, running NASA's software.\" Despite these capabilities, VESL won't overtax computers. \"A key to making the interface tool work is cloud computing,\" Larour said. Instead of burdening your own computer with heavy demand, \"you can access a JPL cloud to run big simulations.\" The VESL platform allows the user to control one or two parameters for each model scenario. For example, in a version of the model configured to represent Columbia Glacier, a slider allows users to change snowfall amounts and examine how the change affects the glacier's behavior in subsequent years. For a sea level simulation, sliders control the rates at which the ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland are melting. \"You can explore different aspects of the model that maybe even the scientists didn't explore,\" Larour said. The site will be updated frequently to keep up with the latest, peer-reviewed research. Scientists will eventually be able to use the graphical interface to display and present new data sets or model results, while lay users will be able to replicate published research results for themselves using models that are \"open source,\" or publicly available. \"As we make progress, [the public] can rerun the science that we actually do,\" Larour said. \"If anybody has concerns or finds issues with our simulation, they have the ability to replicate our results. We would welcome feedback and inputs to improve our science.\" VESL was developed over five years by members of the Ice Sheet System Model development team at JPL and the University of California, Irvine (UCI), with the help of several students, including Dan Cheng from UCI and Gilberto Perez, who attended both Cal Poly Pomona and UCI. The website hosting the simulator will also include a public outreach section, being developed by Daria Halkides, a scientist and outreach exhibit developer of Earth & Space Research in Seattle and a JPL affiliate. \"VESL was initially intended for scientists,\" Larour said. \"Then we realized it could also be an excellent tool for public outreach. These simulations are so easy to run, and visually so compelling, that any person from the public can go and run them and probably understand what is going on.\" You can find VESL at: https://vesl.jpl.nasa.gov/ A paper describing the development of the ice sheet simulator, titled \"A JavaScript API for the Ice Sheet System Model: Towards on online interactive model for the Cryosphere Community,\" appears today in the journal Geoscientific Model Development.

Since then, it has also observed regional features such as the freshwater plume gushing from the Amazon River and localized changes in ocean saltiness following a tropical storm. \"It was a very remarkable achievement, that within such a short period of time after turning the instrument on we were producing very good-looking data,\" said Aquarius Principal Investigator Gary Lagerloef, of Earth & Space Research in Seattle. \"It was beyond our expectations.\" Lagerloef said that objectives for Aquarius' second year in orbit include correcting a few remaining calibration errors and validating the Aquarius dataset with thousands of direct in-water measurements of salinity.

As the principal investigator of NASA’s Radiaton Budget Science Project, Loeb oversees a series of space-borne instruments that measure reflected sunlight and thermal radiation emitted by the Earth. It gives him a chance to satisfy his curiosity about our home planet from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. And in just a few weeks, Loeb will watch as the newest Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument zooms off to space, where it will collect even more data on processes that help drive the connections he finds so intriguing. CERES Flight Model 6 (CERES FM6) will fly on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1), which is scheduled to launch Nov. 10 on a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Observations from CERES provide a critical top-of-atmosphere dataset for Earth’s “energy budget” — the balance between energy received from the Sun, and the amount of energy emitted by the Earth as thermal radiation. “If you know how much solar radiation is going in toward Earth and you know how much reflected solar radiation and thermal emission are going out, what that gives you is the energy balance. If you have more energy coming in than going out then the system will eventually heat up,” Loeb said. He’s awed by the ways in which that balance can influence Earth’s other systems. “It’s quite beautiful and mind-boggling, because how the radiation is distributed over the planet affects ocean circulation and weather in the atmosphere.” Five CERES instruments already are in orbit. Measurements from CERES FM6 will continue to help quantify changes in Earth’s energy budget and clouds, identify the mechanisms that drive those changes, and help policymakers make informed decisions. “What we’re trying to do is extend the CERES records,” Loeb said. The task to collect data on the Earth’s energy budget is why CERES was created in the mid-",

    "content": "A view overlooking the Jet Propulsion Laboratory The latest dispatch from Patricia Song, a summer student who is working with the CloudSat mission team here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). What comes to mind when someone tells you that they work at JPL? Scientist. Engineer. Numbers. People in white lab coats working in shiny, clean rooms with complicated silvery metal contraptions. At least, that is what I pictured whenever I looked at the picture of Albert Einstein on the wall of my fifth grade classroom. However, as my stay here at JPL grows longer and I meet more and more people, I realize that those who work at JPL are not all scientists, engineers, and number crunchers. There are also many different, incredible people who work behind the scenes. They are the ones who help streamline the processes that the scientists and engineers have to go through in order to accomplish their goals. Every day, all employees need to go past the security gates staffed by kind but observant officers — yes, JPL has its own police department and fire department. After passing through the gates and taking that very long walk through the parking lot and finally onto the lab, we see all the people who work on sweeping the leaves off the ground, cleaning what mess the deer leave behind, and making sure the landscaping of the lab is primped nicely. I walk past all of them and finally reach my building. If it is a Tuesday, I can usually find the custodian collecting recyclables around the floor. Although I bring my own lunches, I can’t exclude the people who work at the cafeterias. As I mentioned before (or not if you have not read my previous entries), JPL has a very ‘college campus-y’ feeling to it and the cafeterias are no exception. There are lunch cards that hold credit and a sort of makeyourown fruit cup/salad/lunch thing going on. The workers there take your money, provide services, cook and clean — anything that is needed to run a cafeteria. There are the transportation and shipping people. There are those who help move papers and furniture around when someone moves to a new office. There are those who carry flight hardware into the clean rooms where engineers can use them to build new instruments. There are also the shipping people who help mail out and receive packages that need to go to and from the lab. And of course, there are the people who deal with all the money issues at JPL. There is a whole section of them (in fact, most of the other interns I know and those I have met during lunch outside are people who are working on the money side of things). So even if the lab looks like it's all science, there are dollars that need to be accounted for. A few of the people I spoke to are involved in looking at past projects and making sure that all the calculations involving money are correct. Even with so many different types of jobs needed in order for JPL to run efficiently, the lab hold s variety of talks and offers different ways for employees to learn more. I’ve been to a few of these presentations and all of them have been informative and are helping me make some choices about what I might want to do in school and in the future. So to those people who feel that science and technology isn’t for them, there are many different opportunities to contribute to the work done here at JPL — I mean, who doesn’t think it is cool be able to say “I work for NASA”?

    "content": "5 min read By Joe Atkinson,NASA's Langley Research Center The Long Island Sound — a region known for its coastal communities, beaches, fishing and birdwatching. But it's also a region where noxious emissions, meteorology and the water-land transition open the door to an unwanted guest — ozone. On a bad day, that ozone can have detrimental health effects for millions of folks in an area that can stretch from the New York City metropolitan area clear to the Atlantic coast of Massachusetts. Square in the ozone hotspot — the Connecticut shoreline. That's the bad news. But there's good news, too. A scientific investigation is looking into how that troublesome ozone forms and how it's being transported around the sound. Led by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) kicked off this month and involves researchers from state and federal agencies and academia. Two NASA centers — Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland — are contributing scientists, pilots, aircraft and aircraft-based remote sensing instruments to the effort. Coastal ozone isn't new territory for the NASA scientists. In fact, LISTOS continues work NASA has been doing with states to better understand high ozone events. Studies last year looked at ozone along the Lake Michigan shoreline, Los Angeles and in the lower Chesapeake Bay. OWLETS-2, a study happening concurrently with LISTOS, is looking at ozone in the northern Chesapeake Bay. \"These coastal areas, just the meteorology of these areas in one way or another accentuates getting the high ozone,\" said Jay Al-Saadi, LISTOS platform scientist at Langley — so he and his team are taking to the sky to help figure out what's going on. Ozone is created when emissions from cars, power plants, wildfire smoke and other sources chemically react in sunlight. It diminishes air quality, aggravates breathing problems such as asthma and can even cause lung damage. Children and senior citizens are especially at risk from ozone exposure. Though a large portion of the emissions causing the ozone around the Long Island Sound is likely coming from sources in and around New York City — motor vehicles, ships, industrial boilers and power plants, just to name a few — the city can't take all the blame. \"There are emissions from the Washington D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia corridor, and even from the Ohio River valley that end up in that area,\" said Al-Saadi. \"So just because of the meteorology, because of the way the air flows, it's an even more complicated question of the emissions coming from outside your local area.\" Airflow and heat have everything to do with high ozone concentrations. Land-water breezes can concentrate ozone along the coastline. Heat accelerates ozone production. It can all be a bit unpredictable, which is why the Langley team will have to be fairly flexible over the next few months. \"We're going to have instruments ready to go on these airplanes most of the summer,\" said Al-Saadi. \"And hopefully with a few days' lead time, if the forecasters indicate conditions are getting right, then we'll be able to support flights during those events.\" NASA scientists will employ three different instruments during the study. Goddard's Geostationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization, or GeoTASO, is a remote-sensing instrument that observes reflected sunlight to measure atmospheric trace gases and aerosols over a wide area. GeoTASO will provide critical measurements for LISTOS, but is also a test bed for a future NASA mission called Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution, or TEMPO. Scheduled to launch on a commercial satellite within the next few years, TEMPO will monitor major air pollutants across North America hourly and in greater detail than ever before. \"We're taking every opportunity we can to continue preparing for TEMPO,\" said Al-Saadi. \"We're getting these TEMPO-like measurements at different times of day in field intensives where you have partners that are making the other measurements that you need to truth our measurements. So we get a lot of benefit out of participating in these campaigns that the broader community is active in.\" LISTOS will also employ a new Langley instrument called the High Altitude Lidar Observatory, or HALO, which uses laser pulses to measure atmospheric gases and aerosols. Some flights will also feature the GEO-CAPE Airborne Simulator, or GCAS, another instrument from Goddard that takes measurements similar to GeoTASO. NASA will have instruments on the ground as well. Several Pandora spectrometer instruments will use the light from the sun to measure trace gases in the atmosphere. Langley and Goddard will also contribute ozone-measuring ground lidar systems that are part of NASA's Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network, or TOLNet. Those measurements will complement satellite, balloon, marine and other ground-based data collection methods. The Langley team hopes state and federal partners will then be able to turn those measurements into actionable data. \"It always gets back to, at the local or regional sense, what can we do to help improve the air quality, to curtail the emissions?\" said Al-Saadi. State environmental agencies from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maine are participating LISTOS. Other federal agencies participating in the study include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

    "date": null,
    "content": "4 min read By Carol Rasmussen,NASA's Earth Science News Team NASA's Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) is designed to study how plants respond to heat and water stress by measuring the temperature of Earth's vegetation at all times of day with an accuracy of a few tenths of a degree. Unusual heat can be a warning sign of important changes and concerns in many fields of research besides botany. Here are four other areas where ECOSTRESS's precise temperature measurements could make a difference. ECOSTRESS's radiometer can detect all kinds of fires, but it may be most useful in recording small fires -- new wildfires that are just beginning to grow, and small agricultural fires that only burn for a day. These have proven hard to study from satellite observations. Many satellite sensors make one single measurement of energy averaged over a large area of Earth's surface (pixel), and \"If a fire does not occupy enough of the area, it may not be detected,\" said ECOSTRESS Principal Investigator Simon Hook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ECOSTRESS has a pixel size of only 130 by 230 feet (40 by 70 meters), offering a much sharper view. \"We'll be able to see a bonfire on a beach,\" Hook said. ECOSTRESS's orbit is also an advantage in finding fires. Sun-synchronous satellites pass over the equator -- and therefore over most of Earth's vegetation -- in mid-morning, but agricultural fires are often not lit until then or later, and they usually die out naturally the same night. So even the highest-resolution sensor in Sun-synchronous orbit is likely to be in the right place at the wrong time to see these burns. Additionally, most high-resolution satellite sensors image the same location only once every couple of weeks. From the vantage point of the International Space Station, ECOSTRESS images the same spot every few days. If you watched news coverage of the recent Kilauea eruption in Hawaii, you may have noticed images from NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer. ASTER is one of the more versatile satellite imagers for volcanic eruptions because it can observe both heat and sulfur dioxide plumes, which can signal an impending eruption. ECOSTRESS's thermal infrared imager has the same observational capabilities, plus the advantage of a faster revisit time. Passing over a volcano every few days, it will be able to spot new fissures and hotspots many days sooner than the older ASTER. The heat generated by a large city can compound the health hazards of heat waves, particularly for the oldest and youngest city dwellers. Which neighborhoods suffer from heat the most? Which mitigations work best? \"With the very detailed images from ECOSTRESS, which will be the highest-spatial-resolution thermal infrared space instrument at the moment, we'll be able to see which mitigation efforts are keeping neighborhoods cool,\" Hook said. These data could help a city assess the relative effectiveness of mitigation techniques. Along coastlines and in large lakes, wind can push surface water aside to the extent that cold water from the depths is able to rise to the surface, bringing nutrients with it. These upwellings of cold water are important sources of nutrition for the coastal and lake plants and animals. However, researchers who want to study these upwellings with satellite data are hampered by the same two drawbacks that limit their ability to spot small fires: either the spatial resolution is too coarse to detect the events, or the revisits are too infrequent to catch incidents that last only a few days (or both). ECOSTRESS can detect these smaller upwellings, providing valuable information for understanding how the colder, nutrient-rich material moves and dissipates. As a pathfinder instrument, ECOSTRESS has a limited one-year prime mission on the space station. However, the uses described here and its primary purpose of studying vegetation health were named as priorities for space-based observations in both the last and the current Earth Science Decadal Survey from the National Academy of Sciences. ECOSTRESS measurements will help guide the planning for future observations identified in these surveys.

GRACE-FO will track the evolution of Earth's water cycle by monitoring changes in the distribution of mass on Earth. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech › Larger view The laser ranging interferometer (LRI) instrument has been successfully switched on aboard the recently launched twin U.S./German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellites. The LRI, which is being flown as a technology demonstration, has made its first measurements in parallel with GRACE-FO's main microwave ranging instrument, and initial comparisons of the data from the two types of instruments show that they agree as expected. \"The LRI is a breakthrough for precision distance measurements in space,\" said LRI Instrument Manager Kirk McKenzie of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages NASA's contribution to the instrument. \"It's the first inter-spacecraft laser interferometer and the culmination of about a decade of NASA- and German-funded research and development.\" The GRACE-FO mission, launched on May 22, continues the work of the original GRACE mission of monitoring phenomena such as the melting of ice sheets and changes in groundwater levels by tracking the changing pull of gravity on the GRACE-FO satellites. The microwave ranging interferometer records these changes in gravity by measuring how they change the distance between the twin spacecraft. By accurately measuring these minute changes as the two spacecraft orbit the planet, scientists are able to calculate month-to-month variations in Earth's gravity field. The LRI is an enabling technology for future GRACE-FO-like missions with potential to significantly improve the accuracy of those missions. The instrument is jointly managed by JPL and the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute) in Hanover, Germany. The LRI's \"first light\" operation took place over two days. On June 13, the two GRACE-FO satellites began sweeping their lasers in spiral patterns in search of each other. Gerhard Heinzel, leader of the space interferometry research group at the Albert Einstein Institute and manager of the German contribution to the LRI, explained the challenge: \"There are coin-sized holes on each satellite through which the laser has to be precisely pointed towards the holes in the other satellite over a distance of more than 200 kilometers [137 miles], while both spacecraft race around Earth at 27,000 kilometers an hour [16,000 miles per hour]. It is truly mind-boggling.\" (Here is a fuller explanation of how the LRI operates.) In the data that were downlinked the next day, it was clear that each spacecraft had seen several flashes of light during the spiral scans, indicating both LRI instruments received light from the opposite spacecraft and were working as expected. The settings needed to establish a continuous laser link were calculated and uploaded to the satellites, and the LRI delivered its first intersatellite range data at a later downlink that day. \"The plan for establishing the laser link worked exactly as designed. In fact, the laser link locked in on the first attempt,\" said Christopher Woodruff, the LRI mission operations lead at JPL. In the coming weeks and months, the GRACE-FO research team will work on fine-tuning the operation of this novel instrument and completing their understanding of the data it delivers. GRACE-FO is a partnership between NASA and German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany. JPL manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Additional contributors to the laser ranging interferometer include SpaceTech in Immenstaad, Germany; Tesat-Spacecom in Backnang, Germany; Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado; iXblue in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France; the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics in Adlershof and Institute of Space Systems in Bremen; Hensoldt Optronics in Oberkochen; Apcon AeroSpace and Defence in Neubiberg/Munich; Diamond USA, Inc., and Diamond SA in Losone, Switzerland; Airbus Defence and Space in Friedrichshafe; and The Australian National University.

Toward the western side, expanses of dense, compacted ice—the Patagonian icefields—stretch for hundreds of kilometers atop the Andes mountain range in Chile and Argentina. The northern and southern lobes of the Patagonian icefield are what’s left of a much larger ice sheet that reached its maximum size about 18,000 years ago. Though just a fraction of their previous size, the modern icefields remain the largest expanse of ice in the Southern Hemisphere outside of Antarctica. But rapid change is ongoing. “They are, in fact, melting away at some of the highest rates on the planet,” said Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California-Irvine. Meltwater from the Patagonian icefield contributes to sea level rise. The contribution is less than what will come from Greenland and Antarctica, but scientists plan to keep studying the region from space, from the air, and from the ground.

SNOTEL sites are denoted by white squares and National Weather Service Cooperative Observer meteorological stations are denoted by yellow diamonds. Water is constantly being moved about our planet. The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes how water changes from liquid to solid to vapor and how it is stored in a variety of places: under the ground, in the atmosphere and ocean and in the form of ice and snow. Thanks to new research from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), it is now easier to accurately track snowmelt -- water from snowpacks that melt in spring -- in mountainous regions. Understanding what happens to water in mountainous areas is a challenge. Often the topography of the land is complicated, the seasons bring big changes in water levels and datasets for mountainous regions are typically sparse. In these landscapes, water falls to the ground as snow and, in warmer climates, when spring arrives, snowpacks often thaw and melt, causing the melted water to flow overland as snowmelt. Snow cover is relatively easy to track using satellites that orbit Earth. But to piece together the water cycle in detail, scientists want to be able to measure snow water equivalent -- a quantity that describes the amount of water contained within the snowpack, or the depth of water that would be produced if the entire snowpack melted instantaneously -- over large areas and with high precision. Noah Molotch, a snow hydrologist at JPL, has combined data from NASA's Earth-observing satellites with a new mathematical snowmelt model to estimate snow water equivalent in the headwaters of the Rio Grande basin in Colorado's San Juan Mountains in the U.S. His technique can estimate the equivalent down to a scale of 100 meters (328 feet) over an area of 3,419 square kilometers (1,320 square miles) -- 10 times the area covered by previous snowmelt reconstruction techniques. The Rio Grande basin ranges in height from 2,400 to 4,200 meters (7,900 to 13,800 feet). Sixty percent of the yearly precipitation is snow that falls during the winter months, with the snow persisting until May or July, depending on the elevation. Molotch's snowmelt model calculates the change in mass of the snowpack using three factors. First, the snow melting rate, which depends on solar radiation and air temperature. Second, the depletion rate of the snow-covered area, which is measured by NASA's Landsat-7 satellite and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on board the Terra satellite. These missions take photos of Earth's continents and coastal regions. Third, the maximum snow water equivalent that has built up at the start of the melting season is calculated by adding up all of the predicted snowmelt over the time it takes to melt the snow in a given 100-meter (328-foot) \"pixel.\" Using this approach, Molotch shows that it is possible to track snow mass at new accuracy levels and over large mountain regions without needing to rely on measurements taken on the ground -- a major advantage. According to his results, snow water equivalent in the Rio Grande can be estimated to within about 23 percent of the actual amount under a variety of climatic conditions. Ultimately, the technique could make it possible to measure snowmelt and its contribution to the global water cycle in real time. Research paper: N. P.

    "content": "Illustration of ICESat-2. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center By Kate Ramsayer, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center The laser instrument that launched into orbit last month onboard NASA’s Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) fired for the first time on Sept. 30. With each of its 10,000 pulses per second, the instrument is sending 300 trillion green photons of light to the ground and measuring the travel time of the few that return: the method behind ICESat-2’s mission to monitor Earth’s changing ice. By the morning of Oct. 3, the satellite returned its first height measurements across the Antarctic ice sheet. “We were all waiting with bated breath for the lasers to turn on and to see those first photons return,” said Donya Douglas-Bradshaw, the project manager for ICESat-2’s sole instrument, called the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, or ATLAS. “Seeing everything work together in concert is incredibly exciting. There are a lot of moving parts and this is the demonstration that it’s all working together.” ICESat-2 launched on Sept. 15 to precisely measure heights and how they change over time. It does this by timing how long it takes individual photons to leave the satellite, reflect off the surface, and return to receiver telescope on the satellite. The ATLAS instrument can time photons with a precision of less than a billionth of a second, which allows the mission to detect small changes in the planet’s ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice. Once ICESat-2 was in space, the ATLAS team waited to turn on the lasers for about two weeks to allow any Earthly contaminants or gases to dissipate. “It’s very critical when you fire the lasers that you don’t have contaminants because you could damage the optics,” Douglas-Bradshaw said. “Fourteen days is well beyond the time needed for that, but we wanted to be safe.” During those two weeks, the ICESat-2 operations team turned on and tested the various systems and subsystems of the spacecraft and instrument, and fired thrusters to start placing the satellite in its final polar orbit, approximately 310 miles (500 kilometers) above Earth. Before the laser was even turned on, however, the team eagerly awaited another milestone, Douglas-Bradshaw said. The door that protected the telescope and detector elements during launch had to be opened. The team had two chances to release one of two spring-loaded pins to open the door. This was successfully accomplished on Sept. 29. The following day, it was the laser’s turn. The engineering team had been working with the operations team that controls the instrument on orbit, so the commands were ready to go — first turning on the laser itself, waiting for it to warm up, and then issuing commands to put it in fire mode. The laser energy levels jumped up, and the device that starts ATLAS’s sophisticated stopwatch was active — two different, independent indicators that the laser was firing away. “We were all incredibly excited and happy, everyone was taking pictures of the screens showing data plots,” Douglas-Bradshaw said. “Someone noted: ‘Now we have a mission, now we have an instrument.’” Three days later, the ICESat-2 team had the first segment of height data, taken as the satellite flew over Antarctica. Computer programmers were up all night analyzing the latitude, longitude and elevation represented by each photon that returned to the ATLAS instrument — and by 6 a.m., Tom Neumann, ICESat-2 deputy project scientist, was texting screenshots of the height data to the rest of the team. “It was awesome,” Neumann said. “Having it in space, and not just simulating data on the ground, is amazing. This is real light that went from ATLAS to Earth and back again.” When scientists analyze the preliminary ICESat-2 data, they examine what is called a “photon cloud,” or a plot of each photon that ATLAS detects. Many of the points on a photon cloud are from background photons — natural sunlight reflected off Earth in the exact same wavelength as the laser photons. But with the help of computer programs that analyze the data, scientists can extract the signal from the noise and identify height of the ground below. The first photon cloud generated by ICESat-2 shows a stretch of elevation measurements from East Antarctica, passing close to the South Pole at a latitude of 88 degrees south, then continuing between Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. Next up for ICESat-2 is a suite of procedures to optimize the instrument, Neumann said, including tests to ensure the laser is pointing at the precisely correct angle and lasing at the precisely correct wavelength to allow as many photons as possible to hit the detector. “It will take a couple of additional weeks,” he said, “but about one month after launch we’ll hopefully start getting back some excellent science-quality data.” ICESat-2 launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the final United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket. The spacecraft was built by Northrop Grumman, which also controls the observatory from their Mission Operations Center in Dulles, Virginia.

    "content": "By Bob Silberg, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Mike Farrell portrayed Dr. Charles David Keeling in a new play about his life and research staged April 22 at Caltech. This version of the Keeling curve shows the ongoing rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the similarity of measurements taken on Hawaii’s Mauna Loa (black) and at the South Pole (red). “I passed away eight years ago,” says Dave Keeling at the start of the one-person play, \"Dr. Keeling’s Curve,\" presented April 22 at Caltech. “So why am I here?” The answer is that, like Marley’s ghost, he came to issue a warning. Charles David Keeling was the scientist who famously measured carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and discovered two important facts: Allowing for variations due to changing seasons and day vs. night, CO2 concentrations are very similar virtually everywhere in nature and they’re steadily rising. The upward-trending plot of measurements he took atop Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano became known as the “Keeling curve” and serves as a keystone in our understanding of global warming and climate change. The play, written by George Shea, directed by Kirsten Sanderson and starring Mike Farrell (B.J. Hunnicutt on the TV series \"M*A*S*H\"), launched the third season of an annual festival of new science-driven plays at Caltech. But it might never have come into being if the playwright had gone with his initial impulse. The real Dave Keeling (top) and as portrayed by Farrell (below). “I thought what I should do is a children’s book about Keeling,” said Shea, who has authored some 30 books for children. “But there was not much interest. They’d rather do books about vampires.” So he wrote the Keeling story for the stage, and enlisted Farrell early in the process of developing the script. “The big challenge in a thing like this,” Farrell said, “is to try to figure out a way to make it an entertainment, a play, and not just a lecture.” The approach they chose was to have the Keeling character explain his work within a narrative of his life. The play’s Keeling amiably guides us through his childhood, when an encounter with his fourth-grade teacher led to his lack of respect for “ignorant people in positions of authority.” We hear about his love of mountains and his lifelong desire to do science in nature, away from the claustrophobic labs he describes as “dungeons.” Perhaps most importantly, we see his passion for making measurements that were unassailable. He describes meeting the woman he would marry and how, when she was in labor with their first child, he repeatedly interrupted his vigil to return to the roof of Caltech’s Mudd Hall to conduct his every-four-hours measurement of CO2. And as we follow the story of Keeling’s career and personal life, we see carbon dioxide levels rise from 310 parts per million (ppm) when he began his measurements to more than 400 ppm today. And we learn why that’s important. “As CO2 levels went up, temperatures went up and so did sea levels,” he tells us. “Greenhouse gas concentrations are now at levels not seen in human history and not in perhaps three to five million years. Three million years ago, sea levels were 80 feet higher than today.” Farrell found that the play improved his own understanding of the issue. “What had not been clear to me until I got more involved with this play and with the research involved is how profoundly the climate is being affected, and how quickly,” Farrell said, “and how disastrous it will be if serious steps aren’t taken.” Shea hopes that audiences will experience similar enlightenment. “If people understand how perilous the situation is,” he said, “it might galvanize them into really taking some action.” As we hear early in the play, Dave Keeling was a scientist, not an activist. And \"Dr. Keeling’s Curve\" presents what the playwright imagines Keeling might have said — or at least agreed with — had he survived to this time. But the real Dr. Keeling was not unaware of the need for action. In his",

But they are an incredibly important cog in the ecological wheel — they are the most diverse group of animals on Earth, represent more than half of all known living organisms, and pollinate nearly 80 percent of the world's crops. According to a recent article from the National Science Foundation (NSF), they could also be severely impacted by climate change. Insects are invertebrates and cold-blooded; they lack internal temperature controls so their body temperature approximates that of their environment. This makes them \"great little thermometers\" according to biologist Jessica Hellman of the University of Notre Dame, who is studying the growth and survival rates of insects subjected to changes in environment. It also makes them particularly susceptible to global warming. The question biologists are trying to grapple with is this: Will insects become \"trapped\" in habitats that can no longer support them as temperatures rise and climate change progresses? Will some species be mobile enough to enable them to migrate to cooler climes and continue to survive? Hellman is currently surveying thousands of genes in different butterfly species to see which ones are turned 'on' or 'off' by climate change, and ultimately if there is a genetic basis to the fact that some insect species are more tolerant to climate change than others. It may sound strange to some people to think of relocating insects to new homes. But this \"managed relocation\" is exactly what Hellman and colleagues are looking into. They are working to develop tools that will fold in ecological and social data to help decision makers in the event that insects, animals and plants need to be relocated because of climate change.

This is the first of his dispatches from the negotiations. Will the U.N. negotiations bear fruit? On the way to this much-anticipated U.N. climate conference, my feelings are mixed. In the face of overwhelming evidence of climate change will the nations of the world act decisively? Will Copenhagen come up with the breakthrough approach to global warming most people hope for, or just a step along the road to a solution that everyone expects? Will a treaty on carbon emissions and offsets be forged or will that be deferred to another meeting somewhere down the road? And if there is a treaty, will it be ratified by the governments back home? The first week of the conference is taken up with technical meetings and position papers from participants: here’s our approach to monitoring carbon dioxide [CO2] emissions; this is how we’ve been able to evaluate carbon offsets in the developing world; this is how reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) would work in our part of the Amazon; translating back and forth between the language used by climate scientists and policy makers; and so on. In the second week the discussions will advance towards how a solution might be made to work: how cap-and-trade would operate; the terms of a global treaty on emissions and offsets; strategies for emissions control in the developed world; what REDD might mean for a particular region; and balancing between the interests of the nations at different stages of development. Towards the end of the week, the heavy hitters will start to make an appearance — it’s expected that President Obama will make a speech in the last couple of days, and other heads of state will be making their case too.

I have to say the organization of the traffic to the conference center did leave a lot to be desired. I’ve been to football matches in England where the police have handled the comings and going of tens of thousands of people (not all of whom had good intentions, let’s say), with much greater efficiency. I ended up waiting in line for a couple of hours (not long by COP-15 standards) with a gentleman from Australia who turned out to be Professor Brendan Mackey from the Australian National University, a terrestrial ecologist.

This is the fourth of his dispatches from the negotiations. Managing climate change will involve new levels of policing. In my last entry I talked about the need to police atmospheric (heat-trapping) emissions produced by various industries. But there’s also the challenge of policing deforestation. How do we make sure that countries are actually saving as many trees as they claim? Earlier this week I attended “Forest Day”, a side event in downtown Copenhagen, where there were some really fascinating talks on deforestation and disturbance, mainly of tropical rainforests. Cutting down tropical forests is responsible for nearly a fifth of mankind’s greenhouse (heat-trapping) gas emissions, because trees (especially old-growth ones) soak up and lock away large amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. Talk of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) has been a major focus of the negotiations in Copenhagen. Indeed, the U.S. and other leading developed nations have just offered up $3.5 billion as initial funding to protect tropical forests around the world.

    "content": "Dr. Robert Bindschadler, Antarctic ice sheet expert. By Erik Conway, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Studying the Antarctic ice sheet has been like peeling an onion, with one discovery after another. It’s been magnificent. - Robert Bindschadler Dr. Robert Bindschadler is a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland and has been an active Antarctic field researcher for the past 30 years. He has led 15 field expeditions to Antarctica and has participated in many other expeditions to glaciers and ice caps around the world. He is currently involved in another field expedition to gather new measurements in the water underneath the floating fringe of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. 1. You’ve spent a lot of your career focusing on Antarctica. How did you come to do fieldwork there? When I was in graduate school, we went to Alaska and studied surge-type glaciers [ones that can advance very quickly in bursts]. Then I moved to NASA, because of their interest in ice sheets. At the time, the most active part of ice sheet research revolved around West Antarctica; people thought that because it was the last marine-based ice sheet, it had the potential to be more dynamic than other ice sheets. Since then, studying the Antarctic ice sheet has been like peeling an onion, with one discovery after another. It’s been magnificent. I don’t think a scientist could have picked a better field, because there have been so many major discoveries and rewritings of our understanding of how ice sheets work. We’re witnessing dramatic changes in the Antarctic at rates that we never dared imagine in that first twenty years. 2. What’s the most interesting thing you’ve done in your career? It’s probably the field expeditions that I’ve led. I’ve always liked a challenge, and some of the field expeditions that I’ve led have collected measurements in places or in ways that some people said wasn’t possible. When people say no, it can’t be done, that motivates me to find a way to do it. We were one of the first groups to do a large-scale survey of Antarctica with GPS [a Global Positioning System]. Our next goal is to take measurements beneath the Pine Island ice shelf [in Antarctica]; it’s so heavily crevassed [cracked] that some reviewers of our proposal have said it’s just not possible. I’m bound and determined to get these measurements underneath the Pine Island ice shelf because they are absolutely critical to understanding why the largest changes of the ice sheet are happening right there. We won’t know the future of the ice sheet until we understand what’s going on now. When people say no, it can’t be done, that motivates me to find a way to do it. - Robert Bindschadler 3. Last time we spoke, about a year ago, you were planning to move away from fieldwork and become manager of an ice sheet modeling effort. Why leave field work for modeling? Actually, I’m now doing both! The most important aspect of the work I do is the part that helps give society credible predictions of how sea level is going to change in the future. Ultimately those answers will come from [ice sheet] models. So as much as we might enjoy the fieldwork, we can’t get stuck in that pleasurable realm and we have to make sure our field work helps modelers. There’s a lot of pressure on scientists to improve the projections of future sea level sooner rather than later, so we’re pushing do that. And for us that means that we have to spend less time in the field, rely on space satellites to collect the data, and work on improving the models. 4. Beyond your love of a good challenge, what drives you to do your science? What really drives me to do the glaciology that I do is its direct relevance to people on the planet. Half of the world’s population lives close to the ocean and could be affected by sea level rise. That means that the science we do matters. It matters to my kids and it matters to me, and that’s really important. I think most Earth scientists feel the same way; that this stuff really does matter and it keeps us going. I tell young scientists that the way they will do science in the future will be different. Our climate is changing fast. That will put stresses on society. Multi-billion-dollar decisions will be based on what scientists project is going to unfold in the future. So for young scientists today, there will be a whole new dimension to Earth science that involves the interface of science not just with society, but also with decision makers and local planners. They’re all going to want this information. It adds urgency to what we do. 5. One of the claims that so-called “climate change deniers” make is that the pressure to produce results for policy use also creates pressure to produce results that are tailored to a particular set of policy objectives. Do you ever feel that kind of pressure? I do feel the pressure to give scientific support to particular positions. And I think you simply have to resist that. What really insults me is the claim that we [climate scientists] misstate results for our own personal or professional gain in some cases, too, either for notoriety or additional funding. That doesn’t cut it in our discipline. People who make such charges simply do not understand the scientific community. We are the most self-critical community I can imagine. You will have friends and you will have enemies and you will have to defend every statement you make. We’ve already done that self-critiquing and we are careful about what we say, probably to a fault. To suggest that there are conspiracies rampant within the community for our own gain and notoriety is, quite frankly, insulting and shows an absolute lack of understanding of how the community operates, who’s in it, and what they’re like.

    "content": "5 min read Interview by Gretchen Cook-Anderson,NASA Earth Science News Team Glaciers and ice sheets cover more than 10 percent of the Earth’s land surface — spanning over 6 million square miles (15.5 million square kilometers) of glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets. Scientists like Dr. Waleed Abdalati are working to improve our understanding of how changes in the planet’s snow and ice (otherwise known as the “cryosphere”) affect our climate. Gretchen Cook-Anderson asked Abdalati a handful of questions about ice and its role in climate change. Ice plays a number of different roles in our climate. First, it helps moderate the temperature of our atmosphere. It’s white and reflective and keeps the Earth cool by reflecting sunlight and radiation back into space. Ice also serves as a barrier between the Earth and the atmosphere, controlling the exchange of energy between the ocean and the air. And melting ice is the primary contributor to sea level rise. More than 220 feet (66 meters) of sea level rise is locked up in the Earth’s ice sheets. While I don’t think we have any reason to fear they’ll all disappear tomorrow, melting ice could have quite large implications for sea level. Just one or two feet of sea level change can have major impacts on coastal regions and on society in general. Generally speaking, everything is happening a lot faster than we ever thought it would or could just five years ago. Sea ice has been shrinking more rapidly than even the models have predicted. At this rate, we’re looking at an ice-free summer in the Arctic in the next couple of decades — which will be upon us sooner than we realize. Ten years ago, we didn’t know that if temperatures go up only a couple of degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) at the surface of the planet, ice sheets can respond very quickly. Rising temperatures speed up the flow of outlet glaciers that deposit ice directly into the oceans, causing sea level to rise. NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites are giving us direct information on how the mass of Earth’s ice is changing. Other methods require us to infer those changes, for example from measurements the speed at which melt occurs. But by tracking changes in the planet’s gravity field, which are triggered by movements of water anywhere on the globe, GRACE provides the answers on a large scale like no other satellite. If you’re clever in how you analyze the satellite data, GRACE can also offer answers about where the ice is shrinking and by how much or, alternatively, where it’s growing. I use GRACE data to analyze patterns in ice change, but they also help us identify the “hotspots” on Earth where changes in ice and water may have the most dire societal or environmental impact, so that researchers like me can focus our energies there and understand the mechanisms at play. The amount of sea ice in the Arctic during the summer is disappearing at a surprisingly high rate, losing about 10 percent per decade in terms of area. But its thickness is something we haven’t understood very well. To date, we’ve only been able to quantify with any real confidence the geographic area that Arctic sea ice covers. ICESat has enabled us to estimate ice thickness by measuring the height of ice above water, and inferring how much lies beneath. It quite literally adds a new dimension to ice sheet research, providing clues as to how much the sea ice is thinning and how vulnerable it is to future loss. In addition, it’s been instrumental in giving us an inventory of Antarctica’s subglacial lakes, massive bodies of water beneath the surface that have rapidly receded or — in a few instances — disappeared altogether over the last few years. ICESat's follow-on mission, ICESat II, is expected to launch in",

    "content": "From Dr. Tony Freeman, Earth Science Manager, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Most NASA scientists study Earth from the perspective of space. They use information collected by satellites to learn how the Earth’s atmosphere, ocean and land work. But space, “the final frontier,” is not the only frontier. Researchers also collect data from the ground, ocean and air to augment space missions. In fact, many NASA Earth scientists got their start flying instruments on one of the many aircraft NASA have in their fleet, which is based at the Dryden Flight Research Center out in the Mojave Desert. \"If it all sounds a bit like Indiana Jones without the bad guys that’s because it is.\" A much (much) younger version of the author taken on a field trip in Belize. Why bother with aircraft when we can fly spacecraft? Well, airborne missions enable us to do unique — and crucial — experiments in the fields of atmospheric chemistry and volcanology, for example, from altitudes that range from 100 feet (30 meters) to 60,000 feet (18 kilometers). They also help us to check and validate the performance of the instruments that fly onboard NASA satellites such as Aqua, Aura and others in the so-called “A-train” of Earth-observing satellites. And, airborne instruments are often cheaper to launch. Tethered and untethered balloons; manned aircraft ranging from small propeller craft (think Cessna) to large jet engines (think the DC-8 aircraft); unmanned airplanes such as the large military surveillance craft known as the Global Hawk — NASA uses them all. In this last year alone, NASA has flown: - Over Greenland to study the ice sheet and glaciers there as part of Operation IceBridge (total flying distance was more than 1.5 times round the world); - To the Gulf of Mexico to map the extent of the ongoing oil spill; - To California’s border with Mexico to map the extent of damage caused by an earthquake that rocked Baja California; - Way out into the Pacific Ocean on a Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle packed with science instruments designed to look at cloud formation. Scientists, meanwhile, examined the information they collected live at their desks, through a satellite phone link. Having done it myself, I have to say it’s really exciting to take a brand new instrument that no-one’s ever used before out into the desert, have it bolted on to an aircraft and set off on a data collection campaign somewhere in the world. Over the last decade or so, NASA has flown campaigns over the jungles of Belize and Costa Rica, the icy wastes of Antarctica and Patagonia, the ancient Khmer ruins in Cambodia, the mineral-rich deserts of Australia, the rubble of the Twin Towers in New York after 9/11, and hurricanes forming in the Atlantic off the coast of Africa. And even cooler is the fact that for most places where we fly our aircraft and our instruments, we also send a ground team in to make field measurements at the site of interest. On the ground, I’ve had fun making snow trails on a skidoo, navigated 50 miles (80 kilometers) down the Tanana river in Alaska as far as the Yukon, hiked out on a salt pan in Death Valley in 38°C- (100°F)-plus temperatures, ridden an ox cart in Cambodia, and stopped to let a boa constrictor cross the road in the heart of the Amazon. If it all sounds a bit like Indiana Jones without the bad guys that’s because it is, and I don’t think my experiences would be considered unusual amongst my colleagues.

    "content": "From Adam Voiland, NASA Earth Science News Team Earth scientists milling around the lobby during coffee breaks at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in San Francisco in December had something unusual to mull over. A phalanx of colorful posters, created by a visual communicator who describes herself as \"a note taker on steroids\", adorned the lobby of the Moscone Convention Center. Snippets from the illustrated notes offer a fascinating look into some of the brainstorming sessions that have taken place on the topic of communicating climate science. AGU intstalled the posters at a fitting time: it's been a disorienting month for climate scientists who have watched seemingly specious charges of scientific malpractice become a major news item. One of the posters — called Communicating with Congress (and Everybody Else) — brainstorms some of the pitfalls that make communicating climate science such a challenge. High on the list: jargon. Scientists use such a specialized language that it can be difficult for non-scientists to distill the meaning from certain scientific presentations or articles. Complicating matters more, there are some words that have distinctly different meanings to scientists and to the public. The poster highlighted a handful of them. I've taken the liberty of elaborating upon and defining a few of them below. Did you know the difference? Have any good examples to add to the list? Aerosols The Public: Spray cans that dispense a liquid mist, many of which damage Earth's ozone layer. Scientists: A suspension of any solid or liquid droplet in the atmosphere. Includes dust, soot, pollen, sea salt, sulfates and more. Radiation The Public: Harmful material that leaks from nuclear material and is used to battle cancer. Scientists: Energy that comes from a source and travels through some material or space. Includes electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light and X-rays. Ozone The Public: Something in our atmosphere that protects against cancer-causing light waves. Scientists: A molecule containing three oxygen atoms that, in different parts of the atmosphere, acts as a harmful air pollutant, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, and a buffer against ultraviolet radiation. Error The Public: A mistake, an accidental wrong action or a false statement not made deliberately. Scientists: Not a mistake; instead the difference between a computed, estimated or measured value and the true, or theoretically correct, value. Bias The Public: Willful manipulation of facts to suit a particular ideology or point of view. Scientists: A term used to describe a statistical sample in which members of the sample are not equally likely to be chosen. Also a term used to describe the difference between an estimator's expectation and the true value of the parameter being estimated. For some scientific analyses, a certain degree of bias can actually be beneficial. Cross posted and adapted from NASA’s What on Earth blog.

Not only are most corals brittle, but they usually need pristine, clear, warm, relatively nutrient-free waters to survive.

Through water pollution, over fishing, direct physical damage, warmer ocean waters and increased acidity of the oceans, we are in danger of rapidly sending the world’s reefs into oblivion.

    "content": "By Rosemary Sullivant NASA Global Climate Change A grassroots organization of scientists and educators is promoting seven essential principles of ocean literacy. One of those principles is the idea that the ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems. Size doesn't always equal importance, but in the case of Earth's ocean, it does. So when a college student piped up with \"It's big!\" as the answer to a question about why one should study the ocean, his professor agreed. In fact, he would argue that \"it's big\" is one of the most significant things we should know about the ocean. \"The ocean influences everything we do,\" says oceanography professor Robert Stewart of Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. \"And we influence the ocean.\" The ocean is so vital to life on Earth that Stewart, along with many others, believes there are certain principles about the ocean and how it works that should a part of every citizen's education. He's one of the founding members of a growing national movement to promote ocean literacy. The movement's goal is to help create a society that understands these important principles, can communicate about the oceans in a meaningful way, and can make informed and responsible decisions regarding the ocean and its resources. The push for ocean literacy started about seven years ago. \"It has really been a grassroots effort involving both groups and many interested individuals,\" explains Lynn Whitley, director of education for the Sea Grant Program at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and president of the National Marine Educators Association. \"The huge, first step was to agree on what everyone should know.\" \"We put together a group of leading oceanographers to develop a list of the most important concepts,\" Stewart says, a long-time member of the Ocean Surface Topography science team, a group of researchers funded to work on NASA's Jason ocean missions. Scientists met with educators and policy makers in workshops and online discussion to come to a consensus. At the same time, they began working with the National Marine Educators Association to see how oceanography fit into the science standards that the schools are expected to cover. “We found that the standards mentioned just one thing: the idea that plate tectonics move the sea floor,\" Stewart says. \"The challenge was that ocean topics don't fit neatly into biology, chemistry or the physical disciplines, so they were mostly ignored,\" Whitley says. \"The absence of ocean science in schools resulted in a generation of Americans largely ignorant of the importance of the ocean.\" The ocean literacy movement has grown to include scientists and educators across the country, together with organizations such as the National Geographic Society, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Sea Grant, and the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence. They've created a brochure on ocean literacy and held workshops to tie the most important principles of ocean literacy to the national standards for science education. \"We are now relating these concepts to different grade levels,\" says Stewart. Future activities include collecting and creating teaching materials on ocean literacy and conducting teacher professional development. So, what are the basic ideas that everyone should know? Just seven essential principles: The Earth has one big ocean with many features. The ocean and life in the ocean shape the features of Earth. The ocean is a major influence on weather and climate. The ocean makes Earth habitable. The ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems. The ocean and humans are inextricably interconnected. The ocean is largely unexplored. Ocean literacy advocates have broken these down further into fundamental concepts, such as \"the ocean controls weather and climate by dominating the Earth's energy, water and carbon systems.\" Back in his classroom, Stewart takes a practical approach. Individuals can make a difference, he says. \"I like to teach based on problem solving,\" Stewart says. \"Fisheries, for example. In a restaurant, order fish from sustainable stocks. Global warming, coastal erosion? I don't think many of my students are going to buy condos on a barrier island. They know how dangerous that it. Coastal problems?

    "content": "The latest dispatch from Patricia Song, a summer student who is working with the CloudSat mission team here at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It isn’t often that you meet people who love doing what they do at work. Most people dream of a career but end up working in places that are far from their aspirations. That’s why it’s great when you get the chance to meet someone who loves what they do. One of those people is Dr. Svetla Hristova-Veleva, a scientist here at JPL. Dr. Hristova-Veleva’s office is in building 300. A room cluttered with books, computers, and papers — stacks of research results and reference material. It feels almost magical to be in a room filled with so much knowledge and so many questions — I liken it to stepping into a classroom at Hogwarts and feeling like the 11-year old Harry Potter. Of course, to understand a person’s job, you must first know what they do. Dr. Hristova-Veleva works with hurricane models — a bit like the forecasts that help us predict the weather. Her childhood dream of being an astronaut started her along a science path, and as she learned more about physics and the Earth, she became more intrigued with the weather. How do scientists get their ideas? Often it seems that they research things we never think about, things we take for granted in our daily lives. Dr. Hristova-Veleva’s answer was simple: “By asking questions.” The science community functions well because of the way researchers communicate, the way they share observations, ideas and questions. This helps them brainstorm and formulate the questions and experiments that are needed to find out more about a particular piece of science — like hurricanes, for example. It turns out that studying weather models is a multi-disciplinary subject. As Dr. Hristova-Veleva explained, accurate hurricane models require people with knowledge of, among other things, physics, computers, math, chemistry and ecology. Her work currently involves using satellite data to develop algorithms that describe hurricanes and other rainy systems. It sounds complicated and I certainly do not fully understand all her work, but then I don't need to in order to see how much she enjoys herself. The look in her eyes as she describes her research is as if she is flying through the storm itself, not just looking at it from above.

This one is from Nicholas Derian, who is working with our Global Climate Change website team here at JPL. The morning air was brisk, my knees were shaky, and my forehead began to sweat. I was all dappered up, thinking that the slightest indication that I was not taking the opportunity to work for NASA seriously would result in the boot. I turned up to work at JPL with the preconceived notion that it would be full of socially awkward scientists testing lab rats, shooting satellites to Mars, and eating lunch while discussing the alignment of the axis of Saturn’s third moon. JPL was bound to be full of highly-strung people who ignore all contact with human life forms, right? Well, after the first week or so passed by, I started to notice a comforting aura of unity. My urge to run to the bathroom to sob evaporated, and I could finally make conversation with people who carried clipboards and wore badges of authority. I began to learn that not all of JPL is about exploring the solar system, but that a good portion of the lab’s work revolves around studying a planet that is supremely unusual and spectacular — the one we call Planet Earth. While Earth’s oceans, air, land and ecosystems all seem to be individual systems, they neatly slot together to make up this place we call home. I’ve had a pretty darn good time finding that out so far. And the jitters have gone.

This one is from Holly Shaftel, who is working with our Global Climate Change website team here at JPL. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is considered a big kahuna of Earth and Space science, and just like any outsider entering this eminent world, I expected my every move to be monitored like a psychology patient during a sleep study … not really, but you get the idea. My main fear before orientation was security, because the tighter the security, the more I feel like a prisoner. But upon entering the facility I found myself completely baffled: I expected Smithsonianesque metal detectors and Disneyland-like bag checks, but instead I required only a driver’s license JUST to prove it wasn’t expired. Not only that, the guards actually had engaging personalities, instead of carrying a robotically authoritarian air like a Buckingham Palace guard or Yeoman Warder. It was then that I realized JPL was far from the stereotypical uptight, East-Coast government-owned institution. I’m on my third week at JPL, and I must say the atmosphere is so relaxing that I feel as if I could work on my laptop in a lawn chair every day alongside a small herd of visiting deer (in case you didn’t know, even the wildlife here seem to be animal manifestations of Snoop Dawg), as I enjoy a (virgin) appletini and marinate under southern California sun rays. And, on another note, the term “dress code” seems to be a thing of the past here — basically, if one is wearing at LEAST a badge then they’re ready for action. But really, this place has a big campus setting with a quaint, small town charm. Meeting an employee with a mean bone in his/her body is like trying to locate a missing earring stud in a sandbox, which makes the JPL experience all the more satisfying and blithe.

I pull up to the guard and automatically flash my California Driver’s License and the blue ‘new hire’ paper badge, having readied my license in my cup holder since I left home. The guard glances twice to read my name and check my face before letting me through. I’ve gotten lost once on Tuesday so today I turn right, the path to the lab’s West Parking Lot embedded in my mind this time. Work is different than what I thought. As a summer student, I finally get to see what JPL is all about. It is not an uptight, strict-rules, sophisticated-machinery type of place — at least, not all of it is. There is a college campus feel to the lab (it probably has to do with the fact that it is established by Caltech) and most people that I’ve met seem laid back when they are not focused on working on whatever project they are working on. The scientists are friendly and enjoy talking about their work — they bombard me with facts about lidar (“light detection and ranging”) on one of my first days, for example. One of the highlights so far has been listening to explanations of how things up in space work and how those things in space send information back to us on Earth. It can be intimidating at first, being at a NASA lab, but the employees are friendly, patient and helping me to settle in. This is a place of neverending curiosity, and as long as that remains true, this will be a place of neverending answers. So here is my start at JPL. My very first real paid job — not volunteer work for once — and it is at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory that everyone who lives in the San Gabriel Valley knows about! It has only been a few days and it already feels like I have learned more than I would learn in high school in the same amount of time. I have feeling it will be an interesting and very educational experience. Hopefully by the next time I post my article, I won’t have to show a picture ID with my paper blue badge — I’d have a real one.

Not in the real world, mind you — I was preparing to give a science talk to fourteen under-privileged students at the Miami Science Museum, while I was sitting comfortably behind my computer in Colorado. We were all to meet in the virtual online world of Second Life, which describes itself as the \"internet's largest user-created, 3D virtual-world community.\" We gathered on a NASA in-game island that has been custom built for the purpose of bringing students, teachers and the public together with scientists. In this virtual world, appearance is everything. My presentation would be through a computer-generated avatar, using my voice via microphone, and talking to a virtual roomful of student-created avatars. The presentation would be much like a real one — I had slides to present data, there was a question-and-answer period after the talk, and I would even be on a stage, with a computer-generated NASA podium in front of me. And in execution, it was brilliant; the talk went smoothly, and the virtual world was a fitting environment to present my data. More intriguing, however, was the question-and-answer period afterward. Typically, when I present to a teenaged audience, I'll get a few specific questions, and will end up spending most of my time speaking with one or two students who are really into the material, while the rest of the room looks at the floor and waits for time to be up. This time it was different, as student after student came forward with their questions. The student avatars were much fancier than mine — they'd obviously spent much more time on their hair than I did — and the questions covered a much broader range of topics, from cloud lifetimes, to pollution, to how to get into science as a career. As I spoke with the student avatars, it occurred to me that the virtual world has some real advantages over the real one. In the real world, I think that students are often afraid to step to the microphone and ask a question — peer pressure to 'fit in' can often overpower the desire to learn more about a topic. In the virtual world, however, you're free to be whomever you want to be, dress how you want to dress, and ask any question you choose to ask. Free from any constraints, these students were getting answers to questions they'd always wanted to ask, but never could. In the virtual world, without our real-world insecurities, the transfer of knowledge is unimpeded by social convention, and students and scientists can converse as equals, or even as friends. It was a wonderful experience, and the Miami Science Museum has hit on a winning formula that will foster real science education across socioeconomic boundaries. I hope to be back again sometime, but next time, I'll make sure to spend more time getting my hair just right.

    "content": "Simulated ocean salinity data for NASA's Aquarius instrument. Credit: NASA. By Alan Buis, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory When NASA's salt-seeking Aquarius instrument ascends to the heavens this June, the moon above its launch site at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base won't be in the seventh house, and Jupiter's latest alignment with Mars will be weeks in the past, in contrast to the lyrics of the song from the popular Broadway musical \"Hair.\" Yet for the science team eagerly awaiting Aquarius' ocean surface salinity data, the dawning of NASA's \"Age of Aquarius\" promises revelations on how salinity is linked to Earth's water cycle, ocean circulation and climate. Salinity – the concentration of salt – on the ocean surface is a key missing puzzle piece in satellite studies of Earth that will improve our understanding of how the ocean and atmosphere are coupled and work in tandem to affect our climate. While satellites already measure sea surface temperature and winds, rainfall, water vapor, sea level, and ocean color, measurements of ocean surface salinity have, until quite recently, been limited to sparse data collected from ships, buoys and a small number of airborne science campaigns. From those limited data, we know ocean surface salinity varies by only about five parts per thousand globally. Yet a change of just a fraction of one part per thousand can influence the circulation of the ocean. Knowing the salinity of the ocean surface can also help scientists trace Earth's water cycle – the process that circulates freshwater from the ocean to the atmosphere to the land and back again to the ocean through rainfall, evaporation, ice melt and river runoff. Aquarius, the primary science instrument on the Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D spacecraft built by Argentina's national space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales, will help scientists study these complex, interrelated processes and their link to climate. Recent studies have shown Earth's water cycle is speeding up in response to climate change, which affects global precipitation patterns. Currently, scientists study the water cycle by making inferences from measurements of how much water is discharged from rivers and by measuring precipitation and evaporation rates using satellites like NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. \"About 80 percent of Earth's water cycle takes place over the ocean,\" said Aquarius Principal Investigator Gary Lagerloef of Earth & Space Research, Seattle. \"By measuring ocean surface salinity, Aquarius will be able to track how the water cycle is changing in response to climate change.\" Salinity and the deep blue sea While surface winds drive currents in the upper ocean, deep below the surface, it's a different story. There, ocean circulation is dominated by changes in the density of seawater. These changes are determined by salinity and temperature. The saltier and colder the water, the more dense it is. In parts of the world, cool, high-salinity surface waters become so dense that they sink to great depths, where they become part of deep ocean currents. Found in all ocean basins, these deep currents are interconnected and play an important role in regulating Earth's climate by transporting heat globally. By revealing changes in patterns of global precipitation and evaporation and showing how these changes may affect ocean circulation, Aquarius will help improve predictions of future climate trends and short-term climate events, such as El Niño and La Niña. 'A spoon of salt in a lake' Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, \"A spoon of salt in a glass of water makes the water undrinkable. A spoon of salt in a lake is almost unnoticed.\" Such is the challenge faced by the scientists who designed Aquarius. Since ocean surface salinity generally averages just 32 to 37 parts per thousand around the globe, it's very hard for a satellite to detect its signal. The salinity differences between El Niño and La Niña are very small – only about one part per thousand. Aquarius employs new technologies to be able to detect changes in ocean surface salinity as small as about two parts in 10,000, equivalent to about one-eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a gallon of water. Its unique, advanced design combines three radiometers, which measure the salinity signal, with a scatterometer that compensates for the effects of ocean surface \"roughness\" (waves). The result is expected to be the most accurate salinity data ever measured from space. Scientists will combine Aquarius' maps of global ocean surface salinity with in-ocean salinity measurements to generate routine maps of ocean salinity distribution. Later in the mission, Aquarius data will be inter-calibrated and combined with complementary data from the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. Peering Into a crystal ball (of salt) Scientists believe Aquarius will lead to exciting and unexpected new discoveries – a \"mind's true liberation\" of sorts. They will be able to accurately calculate the rate at which surface ocean circulation transports freshwater. They'll see how salinity is affected by melting ice, freshwater flowing into the ocean, and fluxes of freshwater to and from the atmosphere from rainfall and evaporation. They'll be able to better study how ocean waters mix vertically. And they'll greatly reduce uncertainties in calculating the ocean's freshwater budget (the net difference between freshwater lost in the ocean through evaporation and freshwater added to the ocean by precipitation and runoff). Perhaps nowhere is the potential for discovery from Aquarius higher than in the Southern Ocean. \"Today's salinity maps don't show many features in the Southern Ocean,\" said Yi Chao, Aquarius project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., which jointly built Aquarius with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. \"This is because data there are so sparse. Yet the Southern Ocean is one of the key deepwater formation areas in the world and is one of the key drivers of deep ocean circulation and heat transport.\" Other areas of particular interest to Aquarius researchers include: The Central North Atlantic, where salinity has been observed to be increasing, and the region has been getting more arid The Nordic and Labrador Seas, where dense water forms at the surface and sinks to deep layers in the ocean. Aquarius should be able to observe the year-to-year effects of ice melting on the circulation between Greenland and Iceland. The Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, which have a very large salinity signal but have been less frequently measured than the Atlantic and Pacific oceans And then there's the Arctic Ocean, which has seen significant changes in sea ice cover in recent years. Aquarius will provide some salinity measurements over the Arctic during its ice-free seasons, though the Aquarius signal is less sensitive over cold water. Aquarius' prime mission will last at least three years, long enough to map year-to-year variations in salinity that will allow researchers to develop the methodology for and demonstrate the usefulness of salinity as a climate data record. Aquarius data will eventually be used to improve the accuracy of climate forecast models. Ocean surface salinity is not currently well represented in models used by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its assessment reports. Lagerloef likened Aquarius to an explorer of an unexplored frontier. \"We'll see the ocean in a whole different light. When the first Earth science satellites launched in the",

    "date": null,
    "content": "5 min read NASA is helping the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) harness the power of the oceans by first harnessing the power of the crowd. Ocean waves hold a tremendous amount of energy that is almost entirely untapped, despite our ever-growing need for sustainable, non-polluting electricity. Part of the reason we haven’t yet plugged into this potential power source is that developing the technology to do so is too expensive for many of the people and institutions that are interested in working the problem. “It takes a lot of money to build something, deploy it in the water and test it,” said Noël Bakhtian of the DOE’s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office. “It would be a lot easier to have computational tools, where you can study a whole range of inputs and say, ‘What if I made the device twice as big? What if the wavelength of the waves was a little bit different? What if I pushed it out into the ocean a little bit deeper?’” The DOE wants to be able to offer modeling software to everyone with a potentially great idea for extracting energy from ocean waves. And they’re counting on crowdsourcing to help them to do it. Working through the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and Sandia National Labs, DOE is developing a modeling tool called WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter Simulator). With WEC-Sim, technologists will be able to see how well their designs would squeeze electricity out of the motion of the ocean under a wide variety of conditions. For one of the crucial software modules that will comprise WEC-Sim, DOE teamed up with the NASA Tournament Lab (NTL), a partnership between NASA and Harvard Business School, to mount a competition called the “OpenWARP Challenge” (for Open-Source Wave Analysis and Response Program). NTL is part of NASA’s Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation (CoECI). OpenWARP is one of many modules that will make the ultimate WEC-Sim tool useful. “It’s very much like Legos or building a house, where you can build one room at a time or isolate power systems from the plumbing,” said CoECI’s Michael Ching, who serves as project coordinator for OpenWARP. Structuring the software as modules makes it easier to develop, since no one person needs to master the inner workings of the whole, ultra-complex thing. And it also makes for flexibility, enabling users to substitute their own modules as desired. Or, if they prefer, users will be able to customize the OpenWARP module instead of replacing it. “It’s going to be open-source, which is a big deal,” Bakhtian said. That means the software will not only be available without charge, but that developers will be able to continually improve it or tweak it to suit their own purposes. “We want universities to be able to use it, we want garage inventors to be able to use it,” said NREL’s Mike Lawson, adding that open-source will allow researchers “to change the tools to model whatever new, wacky device you’ve got that the original software developers didn’t think of.” This approach has already produced some unexpected dividends. A French engineering institute called Ecole Centrale de Nantes (ECN) approached the DOE with news that they had been working on something similar to what the OpenWARP Challenge was hoping to develop. “We started working with them closely and they decided that they were going to go open-source with their code,” Bakhtian said, “which we can now work with and build on. This has just been a great win for everyone. ECN told us that the OpenWARP project was a major driver in their decision to go the open-source route.” According to Steve Rader, CoECI’s deputy manager, NASA began pioneering the use of crowdsourcing competitions in",

    "content": "3 min read A NASA scientist who has developed a novel suitcase-size instrument to measure column carbon dioxide and methane is taking her recently patented instrument on the road this summer to comprehensively measure emissions of these important greenhouse gases from Alaska’s melting permafrost. Emily Wilson, a scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, will use her recently patented miniaturized laser heterodyne radiometer (mini-LHR) to carry out a multi-disciplinary field campaign at three sites — each representing a different type of permafrost — near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June. Her team has designed a unique and comprehensive experiment that records permafrost depth and structure, meteorological data, and concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide during the seasonal ground melt. “With the global mean temperature rising, the release of these gases could create an amplified effect,” she said. “These data will allow us to estimate fluctuation of emissions from the melting permafrost.” Permafrost is permanently frozen soil. Comprising 24 percent of the Northern Hemisphere, permafrost contains old organic carbon deposits — some relicts from the last glaciation — that are locked up beneath the surface. Scientists have observed that more of the permafrost’s upper layer, or the active layer, is melting each summer, creating concern that the thawing could lead to the significant greenhouse-gas emissions. Further exacerbating the situation is the fact that while methane doesn’t linger as long as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is more potent and effective at absorbing heat, creating a positive feedback, where emissions leads to more warming, which in turn accelerates the thaw. Highly portable, the mini-LDR is ideal for permafrost studies, Wilson said. Made up of commercially available components, the instrument literally can go anywhere to measure carbon dioxide and methane in the atmospheric column — that is, the levels of these gases in a vertical column extending from the ground to space. Currently, the only ground-based network that measures these two greenhouse gases in the atmospheric column is the Total Carbon Column Observing Network. However, the network has 22 operational sites globally, with limited coverage in the Arctic. “We’re targeting areas where there is limited coverage,” she said. To prepare for the campaign, Wilson made her instrument more rugged and more sensitive. She added a satellite communications port to remotely retrieve data, a thermally controlled instrument housing to protect the instrument from changing temperatures, and a solar grid and battery storage system for powering the instrument in remote locations.

It seemed like just yesterday that I was beginning to adapt to the ways, norms and quirks of the lab — early arrivers scurrying their way to the office like a turbo V8 engine; foreign nationals (dressed like tourists about to journey their way through a South American rainforest) immersed in conversation over who-knows-what in line at the coffee cart; a heavily populated cafeteria for socializing after an industrious morning; a small herd of deer migrating to the very delectable lawns in the late afternoon (although, of course I wouldn’t know this for sure, having never tried a piece of turf myself); a lone scientist sitting at a bench clearly in mid-thought over some elaborate calculation that would send my head into a wild whirlpool … you see a lot of those. And with the personality of JPL comes bragging rights, which have frequently been employed to impress people at parties … and create a boatload of confidence as a result. But even with those, I would say they don’t compare to a personal truth: the vital role of communicating science, particularly global climate change, to the public. Our planet is full of jaw-dropping phenomena, but it is also imperfect as described by Robert Frost — “nothing gold can stay” — which is why I became a part of NASA’s Climate Change Website team in the first place: to help educate the public that our planet is not made of steel (well, technically its core is composed of iron and nickel, so maybe a better phrase would be “not invincible”), and care and consideration for it is immensely imperative. So I’m leaving JPL after having acquired necessary knowledge and experience for a future career aimed at guiding my generation toward a cured planet. I’ve worked with talented, highly esteemed folk who are just as passionate as I am (if not more) about communicating comprehensible scientific material about our planet to the rest of society. And on top of that, I’ve never been so uncomfortably close to a wild buck. And with that said, “ … dawn goes down to day,” and I move on to the next stepping stone.

Holly Shaftel and Nicholas Derian spoke to Dr. Yi Chao, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to find out. If you could be remembered for one scientific achievement, what would it be? I started here as a scientist doing my own research, and then gradually got involved in the Aquarius project to launch a satellite that measures ocean salinity from space. [For these projects] we define the problem, find the requirements, find the engineers, find the scientists, and then reach out to the community. I was one of the few involved from the very start. It’s been a decade, and most people come and go working on different projects. So if I had to pick one thing, that’s probably the most rewarding. We need to focus on the ocean before it’s too late What do you like to do in your spare time? My kids are on the swim team, so I drop them off every day and they swim for a couple of hours. I don’t have the time to swim for a couple of hours, but I do swim forty laps every day. Those are the best forty minutes of my life each day. Name something really cool that you’ve done, or would like to do. I have a project [I’m working on] with the U.S. Navy, developing underwater vehicles. The torpedo shape [of the vehicle] is like an underwater glider; it has wings so it can glide in the water, and with gravity it’ll pull you down to a certain depth. People sell the glider commercially, but JPL developed this flat part that we call a “thermal charging engine” with black tubes, which harvests thermal energy and turns it into electricity [as the] glider moves from warm water to cold water in the ocean. So we’re recharging the glider on the fly; it’s a green energy-powered vehicle. My goal, someday, is to fly the first [aerial] glider around the globe. No one has done it before. What would you like to have written on your tombstone? I guess I’d like to have something that said I made an impact, enabled things to happen, or told people something they didn’t know. If you could inspire people to do one thing, what would it be? I would like to reach out to more kids about the ocean. The ocean is over 70 percent of the globe; 90 percent of the sea floor is unmapped. While it’s fascinating to see the moon and Mars and other planets, the ocean is just as interesting, if not more, and there are a lot of hidden treasures to be discovered. I would have kids wake up every day and check in on a website to read something about the ocean rather than checking Facebook. There are a lot of things changing in the ocean — it could be different a hundred years from now. We need to focus on the ocean before it’s too late. What interesting skill do you have that people don’t know about? I’m a good listener. Some people have trouble listening to others. Listening is a crucial important skill, not only in science, but also in science management. I’m also relatively calm and patient and try not to overreact. If my proposal gets rejected then I put it aside and don’t look at it for a week, and then a week later I get a different perspective. Yi is part of the Climate, Oceans and Solid Earth Sciences group at JPL. He is Project Scientist for NASA's Aquarius mission, which will launch next year and be able to measure sea surface salinity from space with an accuracy equivalent to detecting a pinch of salt in a gallon of water.

That's according to the results of a new report out from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. The study has identified a number of important gaps in public knowledge and common misconceptions about climate change (which Big Fat Planet will write about in more detail here later. To help remedy some of the confusion, last weekend NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena hosted a public forum on climate change. Gray skies overhead caused some worries about attendance, but 160 people from the local community came to hear scientists talk about their latest research. The talks included discussion of: The planet's carbon cycle, clouds and ozone How NASA’s upcoming Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission will help us determine Earth’s carbon dioxide sources (where it’s generated) and sinks (where it’s absorbed) How scientists use satellites to study Earth’s atmosphere How the greenhouse effect is a good thing (it’s made life on Earth possible by keeping the temperature warm enough to be habitable), but it’s the slight change in the balance of gases that is causing the Earth to warm What’s causing the loss of ice mass on our planet, the difference between sea ice and land ice and how each is affected by climate change Sea level rise, and the fact that the rate of the rise is increasing How to maintain balance in writing news stories on climate change science without giving undue weight to non-science-based opinion What we can do about climate change - it's about more than just recycling Promoting green practices locally Audience questions varied from \"Are climate models getting too complicated to understand?\" to \"How do volcanoes affect climate?\" and \"Why are the big countries not on board with climate regulation?\" And the $64,000 question: \"When it comes to discussions of climate change, why is population control not talked about as a possible solution?\" On this unpalatable issue, scientist JoBea Holt relayed findings from population studies that suggest that if girls are educated, it tends to reduce the number of babies, and that once family incomes and health improve, families don’t need to have lots of children to insure that some grow to adulthood. Lots of food for thought, but hopefully a useful event in terms of getting some of the scientific knowledge out there. JPL’s Green Club organized the whole shebang, and will repeat it next year.

The lake, which straddles the borders of California and Nevada, is the largest alpine lake in North America. Image credit: NASA-JPL. Alan Buis NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory PASADENA, Calif. -- In the first comprehensive global survey of temperature trends in major lakes, NASA researchers determined Earth's largest lakes have warmed during the past 25 years in response to climate change. Researchers Philipp Schneider and Simon Hook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., used satellite data to measure the surface temperatures of 167 large lakes worldwide. They reported an average warming rate of 0.45 degrees Celsius (0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade, with some lakes warming as much as 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. The warming trend was global, and the greatest increases were in the mid- to high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. \"Our analysis provides a new, independent data source for assessing the impact of climate change over land around the world,\" said Schneider, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. \"The results have implications for lake ecosystems, which can be adversely affected by even small water temperature changes.\" Small changes in water temperature can result in algal blooms that can make a lake toxic to fish or result in the introduction of non-native species that change the lake's natural ecosystem. Scientists have long used air temperature measurements taken near Earth's surface to compute warming trends. More recently, scientists have supplemented these measurements with thermal infrared satellite data that can be used to provide a comprehensive, accurate view of how surface temperatures are changing worldwide. The NASA researchers used thermal infrared imagery from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and European Space Agency satellites. They focused on summer temperatures (July to September in the Northern Hemisphere and January to March in the Southern Hemisphere) because of the difficulty in collecting data in seasons when lakes are ice-covered and/or often hidden by clouds. Only nighttime data were used in the study. The bodies studied were selected from a global database of lakes and wetlands based on size (typically at least 500 square kilometers -- 193 square miles -- or larger) or other unique characteristics of scientific merit. The selected lakes also had to have large surface areas located away from shorelines, so land influences did not interfere with the measurements. Satellite lake data were collected from the point farthest from any shoreline. The largest and most consistent area of warming was northern Europe. The warming trend was slightly weaker in southeastern Europe, around the Black and Caspian seas and Kazakhstan. The trends increased slightly farther east in Siberia, Mongolia and northern China. In North America, trends were slightly higher in the southwest United States than in the Great Lakes region. Warming was weaker in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The results were consistent with the expected changes associated with global warming. The satellite temperature trends largely agreed with trends measured by nine buoys in the Great Lakes, Earth's largest group of freshwater lakes in terms of total surface area and volume. The lake temperature trends were also in agreement with independent surface air temperature data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. In certain regions, such as the Great Lakes and northern Europe, water bodies appear to be warming more quickly than surrounding air temperature.

    "content": "How do we know what Earth’s climate looked like in the past and how the climate change we’re witnessing today fits into the bigger picture? The instrumental climate record only dates back a couple of centuries or so. To go back further, climate scientists take proxy data — information gathered from natural records of climate variability. These ‘proxies’ include tree rings, ice cores, fossilized pollen, and ancient coral reefs. Even farmers’ logs and travelers diaries can be used to uncover historical climate clues. Take tree rings for example. Each year, trees add a new layer of growth between the older wood and the bark. The size of this layer, or tree ring as seen in cross-section, tells us about the speed of growth and reflects environmental conditions — such as temperature, moisture and even cloudiness — at the time of growth. Tree rings usually grow wider during warm periods and narrower during cold ones. Since some trees live for many centuries and, in some cases, for thousands of years, we can reconstruct temperature and other climate records dating back several hundred years, providing valuable information on how Earth’s climate looked in the past. Which takes me on a tangent: to an interesting tree ring project called “Years” by German artist Bartholomaus Traubeck, who has devised a record player that plays slices of wood. Using a modified turntable, the tree ring data is translated into piano “music”, which ends up rather cataclysmic-sounding. You can listen/read more here. Of course, there is a lot of interpretation left to the programmer to make it sound “pretty.” As Traubeck explains: “The tree slice is turning like a disk and the tone arm is constantly being moved to the inside of the disk like on a regular record player. The difference is that basically it’s just a camera and this camera is a modified camera, a very fast one, and the camera has just moved in and it waits until there is a tree ring passing the camera's field of view and then it is translated into a sound. Sometimes it is a series of piano tones, sometimes it’s just one sound and the melody is defined, for instance, by the rate of growth. In essence, I play the tree’s year rings.” In the same interview, Traubeck says fir trees produce dark C-minor-type music, ash trees are \"compressed and complex\" and walnut is really “stress-y and artsy”.

Holly Shaftel and Nicholas Derian spoke to Dr. Ron Kwok, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who studies Arctic ice cover, to find out. Actually, I don't really care to be remembered. I like what I'm doing and that's enough. I think that's the most important thing. When I started working on the Arctic, which was about 25 years ago, people weren't that interested in the Arctic Ocean. I wasn't planning to be famous or anything; it's just that the work that we're doing is significant at this point to the general public and to the rest of the world. In terms of making a mark, I don't really care. I like running. I also like to fly and sail. But I don't get to do very much of that — I don't have time to do a lot of other things. I'd like to sail around the world. I started sailing when I was in college and sailed when I lived in British Columbia. Sailing in the Pacific Ocean when you can't see any land is very exciting; it's fun to be out in the middle of nowhere. First: Do science! It doesn't really matter what you want to do; everybody needs to have analytical skills. Science helps with thinking about things for the rest of your life. It helps you cope with things and solve problems, and keeps you informed. An example is climate change. A lot of people don't quite know how to think about it. They get rhetoric thrown at them and they don't know how to interpret numbers, but when it comes to the finely-balanced climate, small percentages make a big difference. So having those analytical skills are important. Second: Do what you like to do! It's what my father used to tell me. You have to have the skills first, and then find something you really want to do, and do it well. I'm a good programmer, though I don't do that anymore. I spent a year writing flight planning software for big airlines. It's very rewarding working on software because it's different from doing science — you get more immediate gratification, whereas if you do science you have to wait a long time, and even then some results that are interesting may not have a big impact.

Credit: NASA With the recent focus on human missions to the moon and eventually Mars, hydrogen will continue to be innovatively stored, measured, processed and employed. Beyond use as a rocket propellant, hydrogen may be derived from local water or soil to supply fuel for transportation, electrical power and crewmember breathable oxygen. Experience with fuel cell power and International Space Station life support systems provides an additional basis for future exploration. On the space station, water is split into oxygen for breathing and hydrogen. In the future, hydrogen will be recombined with exhaled carbon dioxide for water renewal. Generating and recycling hydrogen in space will decrease the cost and complexity of remote missions by reducing the need for supplies delivered from Earth. NASA is also pursuing a variety of alternative power sources for aerospace vehicles. One of those alternatives is fuel cells. To achieve improved performance, NASA is building on decades of success with Gemini, Apollo and Shuttle alkaline fuel cell power system development and operations. The agency has also pursued other types of fuel cells, such as methane, metal-air and hydrogen peroxide. In recent years, the Department of Energy (DOE) and private industry have made significant advances in the development of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells using hydrogen and air as the fuel and oxidant for ground-transportation applications. Additionally, the DOE and the ground power industries are working on emerging Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) for ground-based power generation. NASA is building upon these PEM and SOFC developments to dramatically advance fuel cell technologies, providing reliable, compact and high-energy renewable power sources for aerospace applications. With the aid of industry and universities, NASA is addressing aerospace challenges that include reduced gravity, low or no atmospheric pressure, extreme temperatures, dynamic vibration, shock loads and extended duration operations. For airless space applications, the focus is on closed-cycle regenerable PEM technology. The targeted space systems feature power outputs of 1 to 10 kilowatt systems (eventually scalable up to 100 kilowatts), compact sizing (250 to 350 watts per kilogram), and high reliability for long lives (10,000 hours). With the appropriate investments and collaborations, NASA intends to revolutionize aerospace power generation to enable new capabilities.

    "content": "By Adam Voiland NASA's Earth Science News Team NASA climatologist Drew Shindell. Credit: Chaim Jaskoll An assessment report to be released this week by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization shows that reducing emissions of two common air pollutants — black carbon and gases integral to the production of ground-level ozone — could slow the rate of climate change markedly over the next half-century. For decades, scientists have known that both substances harm human health. More recently, evidence has emerged showing the particles also affect our climate, yet the magnitude of the impact has remained uncertain. Some studies have suggested reducing the pollutants could have a major and immediate climate impact, while others have shown the impact of such reductions would be minimal. Now a panel of some 70 scientists, led by Dr. Drew Shindell, climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has reviewed the best available science and concludes that just a handful of measures could yield major benefits in the next fifty years. We caught up with Shindell, who presented findings from the report this week in Washington, D.C. at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, to learn more. Black carbon, or soot, is a type of dark particulate matter produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, wood, and other biofuels. It's linked to a number of health problems, and it also warms the atmosphere by intercepting sunlight. Black carbon, along with other particles, can come from motor vehicles, residential stoves, forest fires, and certain industrial processes. All in all, it's pretty nasty stuff. Ozone is a reactive gas that exists high in the stratosphere, as well as much nearer to and at the surface in the troposphere. Reactions between sunlight and certain precursor gases — especially methane, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide — produce ozone, which is a significant component of smog. Why did you focus your attention on two substances—black carbon and methane? What we really wanted to do was to look at substances that affect both air quality and climate negatively. There are many types of gases and particles in the air: some affect climate, some health, some neither, and some both. We wanted to look just at the substances that damage human health and also cause warming to explore ways to reduce the impact of both problems simultaneously. Of all the pollutants, reducing black carbon and methane, a key precursor to ozone, fit the criteria best. Not exactly. Studies that say what happens if we reduce x percent of black carbon from the air aren't very useful for policy makers because, in most cases, black carbon is co-emitted with other particles that can have opposing effects. What we really need to know is not the percent of black carbon that a particle filter can take out of, say, diesel truck exhaust, but what the net effect of putting particle traps on all the world's diesel engines would be for the whole suite of pollutants that diesel engines produce. And we also wanted to know how much emissions control measures like that would influence specific changes such as global temperatures, human health, and crop yields. We looked at about 2,000 different measures, but there were 16 key measures that we analyzed closely because they likely have the most impact. For black carbon, for example, we looked at the impact that replacing traditional cook stoves with cleaner-burning options, putting particle filters on vehicles, or banning the burning of agricultural waste might have. For ozone, we looked at measures like fixing leaky gas pipes, limiting methane emissions from mines, upgrading wastewater treatment systems, and aerating rice paddies. We reviewed and assessed all the science that's out. However, we found that few groups have looked deeply at the potential impact of widespread use of known control measures, so we decided to do additional analysis and modeling by plugging extensive databases of economic activity information from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis into global aerosol-chemistry-climate models at GISS and the European Commission's Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy. The answer is unequivocally yes. For climate, putting control measures in place could eliminate about half the warming we'll otherwise face over the next 40 years. No, not at all. Over the long-term, carbon dioxide increases are the primary driver of climate change. In order to mitigate climate change, there is no way we can ignore or overlook carbon dioxide. But we could make a major dent in climate change in the near term by controlling black carbon and ozone. Again, an unequivocal benefit. We estimate that adoption of the 16 control measures we considered would save about 2 million lives a year and save 50 million tons of crops a year. The Arctic is one of the regions where we have some of the largest impacts. A lot of pollution makes its way to the Arctic from the Northern Hemisphere. Black carbon not only warms the atmosphere, but it also darkens the surface of snow and ice, which causes them to melt faster than they would otherwise. We found that these 16 control measures could mitigate about two-thirds of the warming we'll likely otherwise see in the Arctic over the next half-century. We found the health and agricultural benefits would be greatest in Asia. I found it remarkable that for incomplete combustion, which gives you black carbon, a group of just nine measures was able to pull down the emissions by about 70 to 80 percent. And all of the technologies already exist. There's no technological barrier whatsoever to reducing black carbon. In an ideal world, I would say people would look at the results and say, wow, doing these kinds of measures will produce major benefits. I hope that some of the spirit and will people have to deal with climate change can energize us to improve air quality as well. Many nations are already pursuing many of these measures for air quality, but perhaps the recognition that there's a climate impact as well will help prod nations, states, and cities to take air quality more seriously. The United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization convened the assessment, which was coordinated by the Stockholm Environmental Institute in York, UK and led by scientists from NASA GISS, the European Commission's Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy, the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok, Thailand, Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, and the Catholic University of Chile in Santiago, Chile.

    "content": "By Mark Whalen, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Adapted and republished from JPL's Universe publication, Volume 41, Number 2 Graeme Stephens, longtime atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University, noted climate researcher and the principal investigator for JPL's CloudSat mission, joined JPL full-time last autumn. Right now, he is working to establish JPL's new Center for Climate Science, an effort that will leverage the lab's varied Earth-system research. We caught up with him for a discussion of the new center. Typically when outsiders visit JPL, they're shocked to see the breadth and depth of the activity that's going on that's really pertinent to climate science and climate change. - Graeme Stephens 1. What's behind the creation of the Center for Climate Science? There are pockets of excellence in climate research performed at the lab that are kind of fragmented, so this center is an attempt to bring some structure to it and to explore the interconnectivity between disciplinary sciences being done here. Of course, there's a lot of local recognition about the excellent climate research on lab. But the wider climate community doesn't generally think of JPL as a place where climate science is done. Typically when outside climate scientists visit JPL, they're shocked to see the breadth and depth of some of the activity that's going on here that's really pertinent to climate science and climate change. We need to organize the climate research here and make it visible not only across the lab, but also outside the lab. When the rest of the world thinks of climate, rather than identifying individual investigators, they will see JPL has a coordinated program in climate. 2. What will the center give JPL that it doesn't have now? Data from many of JPL's Earth science missions are important and relevant to our climate. But it turns out that many of the measurements we make, in fact, aren't terribly helpful from the point of view of being able to project what's going to happen to future climate. Most of the data we collect document the Earth's climate today and how it has recently changed. This is important and needs to continue. But it doesn't necessarily give us the insight as to why and how future changes will occur. JPL's new climate center will help define the gaps that currently exist in the field, and help identify observations that will advance our understanding of the crucial components of the Earth system and how these components interact. We'll need to be organized and structured around the use of Earth- and climate-system computer models and in using important and influential observations for testing our understanding of the Earth system and our ability to model it. The center will also provide a connection between JPL and the leading Earth system models around the world. 3. JPL has a solid track record in Earth studies. How might that improve? By using the Earth observations that JPL helps deliver, we can better determine what we don't understand and what we think we do understand. Working at the intersection of observations and model predictions is a way to do this and is something we will definitely bring to the table. What matters for future climate projections isn't so much how the atmosphere evolves, how the chemistry and composition of Earth change or even how sea ice changes or oceans move heat around. It's really how these different but key aspects of the system interact with one another, each influencing the response of the other. To some degree that is what the center aspires to be about. A lot of JPL's research lies at these intersections, but it's not necessarily well organized and some of the researchers here don't have simple access to the Earth-system computer models that could benefit their research and help them understand how their studies tie in to the work of others. JPL brings to the table an incredible depth of understanding of Earth observations. We also have a very wide range of capabilities for modeling key aspects of the Earth system. The idea is to bring these capabilities together such that the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts. The idea is to bring capabilities together such that the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts. - Graeme Stephens 4. How do you see JPL Earth-science data becoming more meaningful as the center becomes established? We can start to broaden the horizon for some of the research being done here. We might anticipate that folks working, say, in land hydrology [the role of land in the water cycle] might start connecting with those working on the carbon [cycle], which could lead to more indirect research being developed at the intersection between carbon and water, for example. That's where the opportunities will lie and where the future direction of Earth science is likely to evolve. With this cross cutting approach, I think we can shape the direction of future observing systems and help develop a more integrated approach to Earth observations. We can start thinking about not just making one measurement of one aspect of our planet, but making joint sets of measurements and designing satellite missions that can supply such joint measurements. I think the new climate center will impact the way we conduct and generate research. 5. How will the center be organized? What are the best ways in which the different branches of climate science could collaborate? The center will focus on a few themed research areas, namely energy, water, carbon and ice. Thinking about the impacts that climate change will have on us, these are important areas of focus, now and in the future. In the key area of water, for example, the movement of ice around the planet and the changes it undergoes clearly affects not only water distribution, it also affects the Earth's energy balance, because it changes the albedo [reflectivity] of the planet. That, in turn, indirectly affects carbon, because it can change precipitation distributions that further affect carbon stores through impacts on vegetation. These interrelationships are why having a marriage between the Earth system modeling groups is very important. Such links will help us set priorities. Everyone working on climate science at JPL is part of the new Climate Center, and encouraged to engage with this new venture. We'll by funding between two and four new investigators and building partnerships through an academic partners program, which will comprise of a handful of universities. We are also forming partnerships with key modeling centers, such as the U.K. Met Office, so we can begin to connect the great science being done here with those activities. We're also organizing workshops in key climate areas, which will help set priorities and integrate activities. Input from the scientists on Lab will help fashion ideas and direction. We want engagement from the science community here to help shape what the center will be. 6. How will you measure success? Success will involve recognizing great science, in terms of science with impact. We could quantify success in terms of science publications and impacts. But we'll also measure success in terms of the ideas for new key climate measurements and missions that might spin off from the research and the activities of the center, either indirectly or directly. 7. On another subject, I understand that a number of your cloud paintings are on display here on Lab. Do you still paint, and how does it inspire you in your work? Yes, the story about that artwork is described in an article I wrote for New Scientist about how art and science intersected 200 years ago that touched on how clouds got their names, how meteorology began as a science and how all of this inspired the great sky scape paintings of the time, such as those of Constable.

Image credit: NASA/JPL, Université Paris Diderot and the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris. By Alan Buis, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory The latest evidence of the dominant role humans play in changing Earth's climate comes not from observations of Earth's ocean, atmosphere or land surface, but from deep within its molten core. Scientists have long known that the length of an Earth day — the time it takes for Earth to make one full rotation — fluctuates around a 24-hour average. Over the course of a year, the length of a day varies by about 1 millisecond, getting longer in the winter and shorter in the summer. These seasonal changes in Earth's length of day are driven by exchanges of energy between the solid Earth and fluid motions of Earth's atmosphere (blowing winds and changes in atmospheric pressure) and its ocean. Scientists can measure these small changes in Earth's rotation using astronomical observations and very precise geodetic techniques. But the length of an Earth day also fluctuates over much longer timescales, such as interannual (two to 10 years), decadal (approximately 10 years), or those lasting multiple decades or even longer. A dominant longer timescale mode that ranges from 65 to 80 years was observed to change the length of day by approximately 4 milliseconds at the beginning of the 20th century. These longer fluctuations are too large to be explained by the motions of Earth's atmosphere and ocean. Instead, they're due to the flow of liquid iron within Earth's outer core, where Earth's magnetic field originates. This fluid interacts with Earth's mantle to affect Earth's rotation. While scientists cannot observe these flows directly, they can deduce their movements by observing Earth's magnetic field at the surface. Previous studies have shown that this flow of liquid iron in Earth's outer core oscillates, in waves of motion that last for decades with timescales that correspond closely to long-duration variations in Earth's length of day. Still other studies have observed a link between the long-duration variations in Earth's length of day and fluctuations of up to 0.2 °C (0.4 °F) in Earth's long-term global average surface air temperature. So how might all three of these variables — Earth's rotation, movements in Earth's core (formally known as the core angular momentum) and global surface air temperature — be related? That's what researchers Jean Dickey and Steven Marcus of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and colleague Olivier de Viron of the Universite Paris Diderot and Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris in France, set out to discover in a first-of-its-kind study.

In his trunk, a luggage-sized air-sampling instrument sniffs the outside air through a small tube to measure the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. While not a very efficient way to study urban emissions, the ground data being collected are helping Duren and his team build confidence in greenhouse gas measurements taken from aircraft and satellites, which can cover large areas more effectively. At the next exit, Duren pulls over to admire a scene most Angelenos would try to ignore: a large landfill stretched alongside the freeway. The instrument in the trunk quickly detects a large plume of methane emanating from the landfill. A NASA aircraft soon appears overhead, carrying a prototype satellite instrument that records high-resolution images of methane that scientists can use to identify gas plumes. The pilot buzzes the landfill several times to capture images of the invisible gas, then the plane departs and Duren heads off to his next study area. The instruments in the Prius and airplane are just two of many elements of the Megacities Carbon Project, an international, multi-agency pilot initiative to develop and test ways to monitor greenhouse gas emissions in megacities: metropolitan areas of at least 10 million people. Cities and their power plants are the largest sources of human-produced greenhouse gas emissions and are the largest human contributors to climate change. Duren is principal investigator for the LA component of the Megacities Carbon Project. He hopes to work with international partners to deploy a global urban carbon monitoring system that will eventually allow local policymakers to fully account for the many sources and sinks, or storage sites, of carbon and how they change over time.

Shindell and colleagues used a comprehensive computer model and climate simulator — one of the first capable of accounting for the role of short-lived particles expelled in vehicle fumes called aerosols — that shows vehicle fumes exact an enormous toll in all countries and especially in the developing world.

    "content": "Close-up of the WINCS instrument, which is specially designed to fly on Cubesats. Credit: NASA/Debora McCallum Lori Keesey NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center More than a decade ago, technologist Fred Herrero realized that to truly understand the ever-changing dynamics of Earth’s upper atmosphere, he would need an armada of satellites gathering simultaneous, multipoint measurements. With satellites costing $100 million or more, he knew that was out of the question. His solution: Promote the development of tiny, less expensive satellites and develop a miniaturized instrument ideally suited to gather data about Earth’s ionosphere and thermosphere, a volatile slice of the atmosphere that stretches from about 60 miles to more than 350 miles above Earth’s surface. His vision is becoming a reality. This fall, Herrero and his team, including technologists Rusty Jones and Patrick Roman, are expected to begin delivering the first of several units of the Winds-Ion-Neutral Composition Suite (WINCS). The instrument, developed with significant support from Herrero’s partner, Andrew Nicholas of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), includes four spectrometers and three detectors assembled into a three-inch package using just 1.3 watts of power. Its diminutive size makes it an ideal payload for an emerging class of small spacecraft, often called Cubesats, promoted in recent years by the Defense Department and the National Science Foundation. \"By merit of Moore's law, the goal of any technological development should be the reduction of volume and power,\" technologist Jones said. “WINCS is a significant and brilliant step in that direction. Because of Fred’s insights, I suspect that one day in the foreseeable future, we will see mass spectrometers the size of wristwatches.” As of today, the team is scheduled to deliver a total of seven instruments, all slated to fly on Cubesat missions over the next few years. In the fall, the team will deliver the first of three to NRL, followed by one to the Air Force Research Laboratory, one to the University of Michigan, and two to Boeing Aerospace, which is developing a Cubesat mission for the Air Force. The European Space Agency also is interested in buying the instrument, as is a Spanish aerospace company, Herrero said. \"Once we deliver the first, it will be like a little factory here,\" he added. \"What's amazing about WINCS is not just its small size. It also will enable measurements we’ve never made before. For the first time, we will be able to measure the full vector of wind.\" Herrero began conceptualizing WINCS more than a decade ago when he realized that to truly understand the ionosphere and thermosphere, scientists would have to gather multipoint measurements of the direction and temperature of winds, neutrals and ions, as well as their composition. Last year, the team received Goddard R&D funding to improve the instrument’s resolution, and more importantly, its reliability. \"The improvements drastically increased reliability far over any such instruments gathering data in this portion of the atmosphere,\" Herrero said. The information he and his partners seek is of practical importance. \"Everyone in this field is interested in the types of measurements WINCS can make,\" Roman said. The ionosphere and thermosphere are heavily influenced by the energy carried through space by the solar wind. Under particularly tumultuous conditions, this energy can heat up the thermosphere, which then expands, exerting an atmospheric drag on orbiting spacecraft. Ultimately, the spacecraft prematurely lose altitude and plunge to Earth. The ionosphere, meanwhile, is the medium through which satellite communications must travel. If the ionosphere is disrupted, communications signals are thrown off. Understanding this region is made more challenging because the environment changes quickly with distance — a situation that requires multiple satellites gathering the same data at various locations around the globe. \"We’re not going to learn anything new with just one satellite,\" Herrero said. \"We need at least 50 satellites. Thank goodness, someone came up with the idea of a Cubesat.\" This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "5 min read By Bob Silberg,NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Imagine a generator pumping more electricity than a nuclear power plant into the grid, but inconsistently and without the grid’s caretakers being able to see what it was doing. How could they maintain the critical balance between generation and consumption that the grid requires? A key to the answer hovers some 22,000 miles overhead. The amount of electricity fed into an electrical grid at any given moment must equal the amount that is being used at that moment. Too much or too little could damage the millions of electrical devices connected to the grid or even trigger a power outage. Nine of North America’s largest grids have special independent organizations charged with maintaining that balance. California Independent Service Operator (ISO) manages the grid that serves most of California and a chunk of Nevada. They rebalance the grid’s intake and output every four seconds, using sophisticated algorithms to forecast demand and a variety of ways to adjust the wattage they introduce into the system throughout the day. But they can only manage what they can see: the big power plants that produce the bulk of the system’s electricity. “We can’t see the solar panels on the rooftop of your house,” said Jim Blatchford, the ISO’s short-term forecasting manager. “We don’t know how much they are reducing your demand or feeding back into the grid.” And that’s a significant challenge. The nearly 200,000 solar installations on private homes and businesses in California, taken together, generate more electricity than any power plant in the state. Clearly, grid managers need to take them into account to calculate accurately how much electricity the grid should carry. But this multitude of small solar setups is scattered over a vast area with a wide range of highly variable weather conditions that affect how much sunlight each one receives—and therefore how much electricity it produces—at any given moment. The sun may shine brightly on a rooftop in Bakersfield while a bungalow in Santa Monica is shrouded in fog. When the fog lifts and those panels begin to produce, a morning shower may dampen productivity in San Francisco while a giant cloud bank plays peekaboo with the sun over Sacramento. Tracking all those solar panels and their ever-changing environments may seem like herding cats, but a company called Clean Power Research (CPR) has developed a solution that the California ISO is currently testing. CPR accumulated information about the state’s small solar installations by playing a role in registering them for rebates. So they know where the solar panels are and the size, angle and shading characteristics of each group. What remains is to determine how much sunlight reaches each set of solar panels at any given time, and that’s where the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system comes in. CPR uses a stream of data from GOES in real time to characterize how much sunlight each relevant square kilometer of California is receiving and to forecast how the picture is going to change over the course of a week. “If you look at a series of those GOES images, you can track the motion of the clouds,” said Adam Kankiewicz, Solar Research Specialist at CPR. “You can say if it’s gone from here to here in the last hour, we predict that it’s going to go, say, 10 kilometers in that direction in two hours. For short-term forecasting, that's the most accurate method out there.” “We model each of those nearly 200,000 systems individually,” said Mark Liffmann, who is Vice President of Business Development, Sales and Marketing at CPR. “We use the irradiance (the measurement of sunlight intensity) to determine how much electricity each system is likely to produce each hour for the next seven days, and then we aggregate those forecasts and feed that into the ISO’s software so they can determine how much generation they’ll need to meet the net load.” CPR’s software and the ISO’s software engage in an ongoing dialogue to keep the balancing authority up to date. “It needs to happen quickly in real time,” Liffmann said. “You need the ongoing forecast continuously to be able to accurately calculate what solar panels are going to provide and therefore what traditional resources you are going to need to turn on and off.” California ISO’s Blatchford points out that the monitoring and forecasting that GOES enables can also help his organization determine what to expect from the large, commercial solar stations in its system. Their output is just as dependent on weather conditions as a small rooftop system. “The sun angle plays a big part in it, too,” he said. “A cloud 10 miles away from the plant could be in between the plant and the sun.” Despite the challenges they present, having California’s single largest generator in the form of 200,000 widely dispersed solar-panel setups has a big potential upside. “It gives you two advantages,” Liffmann said. “One, you don’t have a single point of failure. If one system goes down, it’s a small percentage of the total generation. The other is that it smooths out a lot of the weather variation. As long as you can forecast it well, it’s a great benefit.” And the view from 22,000 miles up is indispensible to making those forecasts. “GOES satellites are the only available source for the images we need over North America,” Kankiewicz said. NASA uses satellite lidar technology to study Earth’s forests, key carbon sinks.

Snowfall has been scarce so far in places that were overwhelmed with the white stuff by the same time last year. Here's a prime example. \"The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Sierras of California got more than 200 inches of snow last December,\" says NASA climatologist Bill Patzert of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"This December they got less than 10 inches.\" Temperatures have flip-flopped too. There were 583 new heat records broken in the first five days of January in the US. \"It's 86 degrees in Los Angeles today [Wednesday, January 4th],\" says Patzert. \"Everyone thinks it's July! In fact, it's warmer today in LA than it was on July 4th last year. And it's been in the 60s and 70 even in the Dakotas lately.\" On January 5th in Bismark, North Dakota, it was 62 -- a marked departure from their average 23 degrees for that day. It was 66 in Denver, Colorado, where it's usually in the low 40s on that date. What's going on? Patzert identifies two culprits: La Niña and the Arctic Oscillation. First of all,\" he explains, \"we are experiencing a La Niña pattern of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This pushes the jet stream and the cold arctic air northward.\" \"On top of that, this year's Arctic Oscillation has been stronger.\" The Arctic Oscillation is the whirlpool motion of the air around the North Pole. When this motion is weaker, like last year, cold air escapes from that whirlpool and heads southward to the US. \"This year the whirlpool has been more forceful, corralling the cold air and keeping it nearer the pole. That has reinforced the La Niña impact.\" While the corralling action of the Arctic Oscillation has kept snow away from parts of the contiguous United States, it has brought extra snow to places inside the whirlpool. \"The strong positive AO has kept the Jet Stream north,\" says Patzert. \"Snow-delivering storm tracks are pounding Alaska.\" Cordova, a small coastal town about 150 miles east of Anchorage, has been especially hard hit. More than 18 feet of snow has fallen so far this winter. Snow dumps are full, roads have turned into one-lane \"snow canyons,\" and National Guardsmen have been sent in to help residents dig out. Even heartbroken snow-lovers of the lower 48 don't want that much white stuff. But they'd like some. \"Be patient,\" advises Patzert. \"We haven't gotten to the heart of winter.

Over the life of Irene, TRMM also calculated cloud heights, which indicated strengthening or weakening of the hurricane. TRMM noticed that whenever \"hot towers\" or towering high cumulonimbus clouds peaked near the top of the troposphere that Irene would later strengthen, and she did.

On Tuesday, Aug. 30, NASA's next earth-observing research satellite arrived at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California to begin preparations for an October launch. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project (NPP) is the first of a new generation of satellites that will observe many facets of our changing Earth. The satellite will collect critical data to improve our understanding of long-term climate change and short-term weather conditions. With NPP, NASA continues many key data records initiated by the agency's Earth Observing System satellites by monitoring changes occurring in the atmosphere, oceans, vegetation, ice and solid Earth. On Aug. 28, NPP was placed in a shipping container and loaded on a transport truck at Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colo.

A NASA-led team of scientists took to the Chesapeake Bay this summer to study a diverse yet close-to-home ecosystem in a field campaign that will help the agency determine how to study ocean health and air quality in coastal regions from space. Two weeks of research cruises throughout the Chesapeake during a steamy July provided scientists with a detailed wealth of data on what might be called the fundamentals of the ecosystem. How do nutrient levels, pollutants, organic matter, water temperature and dissolved oxygen change throughout the day? What is the makeup of particulate matter in the air, and how does poor air from nearby urban and industrial regions move around above the water and ultimately influence the bay? And how does the air, water and land – or in this case, wetland – affect one another? Antonio Mannino, an oceanographer at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., and Maria Tzortziou, an oceanographer and physicist at the University of Maryland and Goddard Space Flight Center, led the campaign as chief scientists. Both are working toward what would be a first for NASA and a significant milestone for their field: a geostationary satellite designed to make detailed measurements of ocean color and air quality along the coasts. Current and former NASA satellite instruments have measured ocean color – in essence, a measure of the amount of sediment, dissolved organics and phytoplankton in the water – from polar orbits. These have provided significant and long-term global data on the composition, productivity and health of the oceans. But NASA has never had a geostationary satellite – meaning it would occupy the same spot hundreds of miles above Earth, rather than orbiting around the planet – for ocean color. This would provide constant coverage of dynamic ecosystems, providing important information of the sort Mannino,Tzortziou and more than 20 other scientists from nine US academic and research institutes were gathering directly in the field this summer – how do air and ocean qualities change throughout a day, not just over long periods of time?

Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech By Alan Buis Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. A NASA-led team has used radar sounding technology developed to explore the subsurface of Mars to create high-resolution maps of freshwater aquifers buried deep beneath an Earth desert, in the first use of airborne sounding radar for aquifer mapping. The research may help scientists better locate and map Earth's desert aquifers, understand current and past hydrological conditions in Earth's deserts and assess how climate change is impacting them. Deserts cover roughly 20 percent of Earth's land surface, including highly populated regions in the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, west and central Asia and the southwestern United States. An international team led by research scientist Essam Heggy of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., recently traveled to northern Kuwait to map the depth and extent of aquifers in arid environments using an airborne sounding radar prototype. The 40-megahertz, low-frequency sounding radar was provided by the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena; and the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, France. Heggy's team was joined by personnel from the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR), Kuwait City. For two weeks, the team flew a helicopter equipped with the radar on 12 low-altitude passes (1,000 feet, or 305 meters) over two well-known freshwater aquifers, probing the desert subsurface down to the water table at depths ranging from 66 to 213 feet (20 to 65 meters). The researchers successfully demonstrated that the radar could locate subsurface aquifers, probe variations in the depth of the water table, and identify locations where water flowed into and out of the aquifers. \"This demonstration is a critical first step that will hopefully lead to large-scale mapping of aquifers, not only improving our ability to quantify groundwater processes, but also helping water managers drill more accurately,\" said Muhammad Al-Rashed, director of KISR's Division of Water Resources. The radar is sensitive to changes in electrical characteristics of subsurface rock, sediments and water- saturated soils. Water-saturated zones are highly reflective and mirror the low-frequency radar signal. The returned radar echoes explored the thick mixture of gravel, sand and silt that covers most of Kuwait's northern desert and lies above its water table. The team created high-resolution cross sections of the subsurface, showing variations in the fresh groundwater table in the two aquifers studied. The radar results were validated with ground measurements performed by KISR. \"This research will help scientists better understand Earth's fossil aquifer systems, the approximate number, occurrence and distribution of which remain largely unknown,\" said Heggy. \"Much of the evidence for climate change in Earth's deserts lies beneath the surface and is reflected in its groundwater. By mapping desert aquifers with this technology, we can detect layers deposited by ancient geological processes and trace back paleoclimatic conditions that existed thousands of years ago, when many of today's deserts were wet.\" Heggy said most recent observations, scientific interest and data analyses of global warming have concentrated on Earth's polar regions and forests, which provide direct measurable evidence of large-scale environmental changes. Arid and semi-arid environments, which represent a substantial portion of Earth's surface, have remained poorly studied. Yet water scarcity and salt content, changes in rainfall, flash floods, high rates of aquifer exploitation and growth of desert regions are all signs that suggest climate change and human activities are also affecting these arid and semi-arid zones. The radar sounding prototype shares similar characteristics with two instruments flying on Mars-orbiting spacecraft: Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS), on the European Space Agency's Mars Express, and Shallow Radar (SHARAD), on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. MARSIS, jointly developed by JPL and the Italian Space Agency, probes the Martian subsurface sediments and polar ice caps to a maximum depth of about 1.9 miles (3 kilometers). SHARAD, also built by the Italian Space Agency, looks for liquid or frozen water in the first few hundred feet of Mars' crust and probes Mars' polar caps. Both instruments have found evidence of ice in the Martian subsurface, but have not yet detected liquid water. The Kuwait results may lead to revised interpretations of data from these two instruments. The research follows earlier work by JPL scientists to probe the subsurface of the Sahara desert using higher-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar instruments flown onboard three space shuttle missions in",

Credit: NASA / Tony Landis By Beth Hagenauer, NASA Dryden Flight Research Center A group of environmental scientists has set up an office in an aircraft hangar at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards, Calif., in preparation for a multi-year airborne science investigation of hurricane formation and intensification. As they work on their computers, the scientists are also monitoring the installation and testing of specialized weather-monitoring instruments on one of NASA's Global Hawk remotely operated unmanned aircraft. This hands-on approach to research is part of a critical buildup to a hurricane study sponsored by NASA's Earth Venture Program that begins collecting data next summer. NASA's Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel, or HS3, investigation is a multi-year study of the processes that underlie hurricane formation and intensity change in the Atlantic Ocean. \"The high-altitude and long-duration capabilities of NASA's Global Hawks allow HS3 to sample storms virtually anywhere in the Atlantic and for durations up to three times that of conventional aircraft,\" said principal investigator Scott Braun of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"Being able to stay over a storm for 15 or more hours allows us to observe storms in ways that were simply not possible before.\" HS3 conducted two checkout flights of one of NASA's Global Hawks, one of 24 hours duration Sept. 8 - 9 over the Pacific Ocean and the second of about 19.5 hours on Sept. 13 – 14 over the Gulf of Mexico. Data were gathered by three scientific instruments that will be used during the mission. The payload included NOAA's Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (the NOAA dropsonde) in the tail of the Global Hawk. Dropsondes are small devices designed to be dropped from an aircraft to collect atmospheric data as they fall to the ground or the ocean surface. This system was designed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. In addition, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Scanning High-Resolution Interferometer Sounder, or S-HIS, was mounted in the Global Hawk’s belly. The sensor measures emitted thermal radiation to obtain temperature and water vapor profiles of the atmosphere. The third instrument was the High Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer, or HAMSR, developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. HAMSR provides measurements that can be used to infer the 3-D distribution of temperature, water vapor and cloud-liquid water in the atmosphere, even in the presence of clouds. Like S-HIS and the dropsondes, it provides information on the vertical profile of temperature and humidity. The goal of the Pacific flight was to compare the temperature and humidity profiles from the S-HIS and HAMSR remote sensors with in situ measurements provided by the dropsondes. Given the uncertainty associated with measuring these quantities from a distance using infrared and microwave technologies, data from the two instruments will be compared to the accurate and much higher resolution data from the dropsondes. During the 19.5-hour flight to the Gulf of Mexico, the Global Hawk rendezvoused with a NOAA Gulfstream IV. Both aircraft were equipped with dropsonde systems and this flight provided comparison data between them. These checkout flights were flown to prepare for the deployment of two Global Hawks to NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Va., during the summer of",

    "date": null,
    "content": "4 min read A new NASA analysis of 30-years of satellite data suggests that a previously observed trend of high altitude clouds in the mid-latitudes shifting toward the poles is caused primarily by the expansion of the tropics. Clouds are among the most important mediators of heat reaching Earth's surface. Where clouds are absent, darker surfaces like the ocean or vegetated land absorb heat, but where clouds occur, their white tops reflect incoming sunlight away, which can cause a cooling effect on Earth’s surface. Where and how the distribution of cloud patterns change strongly affects Earth's climate. Understanding the underlying causes of cloud migration will allow researchers to better predict how they may affect Earth's climate in the future. George Tselioudis, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University in New York City, was interested in which air currents were shifting clouds at high altitude – between about three and a half and six miles high – toward the poles. The previous suggested reason was that climate change was shifting storms and the powerful air currents known as the jet streams – including the one that traverses the United States – toward the poles, which in turn were driving the movement of the clouds. To see if that was the case, Tselioudis and his colleagues analyzed the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project data set, which combines cloud data from operational weather satellites, including those run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide a 30-year record of detailed cloud observations. They combined the cloud data with a computer re-creation of Earth's air currents for the same period driven by multiple surface observations and satellite data sets. What they discovered was that the poleward shift of the clouds, which occurs in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, connected more strongly with the expansion of the tropics, defined by the general circulation Hadley cell, than with the movement of the jets. The Hadley cell is one of the major ways air is moved around the planet. Existing in both hemispheres, it starts when air in the tropics, which is heated at the surface by intense sunlight, warms and rises. At high altitudes it is pushed away from the equator towards the mid-latitudes to the north and south. Then it begins to sink back to Earth's surface, closing the loop. \"What we find, and other people have found it as well, is that the sinking branch of the Hadley cell, as the climate warms, tends to be moving poleward,\" said Tselioudis. \"It's like you're making the tropical region bigger.\" And that expansion causes the tropical air currents to blow into the high altitude clouds, pushing them toward the poles, he said. The results were published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. Scientists are working to understand exactly why the tropics are expanding, which they believe is related to a warming climate. The poleward shift of high altitude clouds affects how much sunlight reaches Earth's surface because when they move, they reveal what's below. \"It's like pulling a curtain,\" said Tselioudis. And what tends to be revealed depends on location – which in turn affects whether the surface below warms or not. \"Sometimes when that curtain is pulled, as in the case over the North Atlantic ocean in the winter months, this reduces the overall cloud cover\" in the lower mid-latitudes, the temperate regions outside of the tropics, Tselioudis said. The high altitude clouds clear to reveal dark ocean below – which absorbs incoming sunlight and causes a warming effect. However, in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, the high altitude clouds usually clear out of the way to reveal lower altitude clouds below – which continue to reflect sunlight from their white tops, causing little effect on the solar radiation reaching the surface. When the results are taken together, the bottom line is that the cloud interactions with atmospheric circulation and solar radiation are complicated, and the tropical circulation appears to play a dominant role, said Tselioudis. That information is a new insight that will likely be used by the climate modeling community, including the scientists who contribute modeling expertise to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said Lazaros Oreopoulos, a cloud and radiation budget researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who was not involved in the study. Climate modelers aim for their computer simulations to correspond as closely to reality as possible in order to reliably predict Earth's future climate. \"If current behavior is not well simulated, then confidence in predicted future behavior will be lower,\" Oreopoulos said. \"I anticipate this study to be looked at carefully and affect thinking on these matters.\" Read the paper at Geophysical Research Letters: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.",

Of course they know; they hear it all the time. It’s my 21st semester teaching introductory Earth science courses to non-science majors, and I typically start the semester with a spiel about the desperate need for, colossal significance of, and the dearth of science literacy in our society. It’s so easy to name athletes, artists and even business leaders, but how easy is it to make a list of scientists, even though their contributions to our society are huge? Misconceptions and stereotypes about science and scientists abound. Like many of us, I have strong opinions regarding the education battle being waged in our country today, especially in the sciences. I too want to make an impact, change it up, inspire and innovate. But in order to get my message across, I believe that, first, I have to step back, hesitate and listen. Why should I expect the students in front of me to pay any attention whatsoever, or care, or absorb anything that I have to impart, if I haven’t taken hold of where they are, what they feel, and what ideas are spinning around in their own heads first? The initial step, therefore, is to find out how much they understand and what they come to the table with, rather than just talking at them as if the process of education isn't an interaction. So, in order to acknowledge their intellectual value, and to give respect to what they actually think, on the first day of class I ask them to write about their preconceptions about science and scientists. The following are excerpts from their answers. Judge them as you will, but in your horror as well as your delight, please also remember that these students have delivered up both honesty and candor. That in itself is something worthwhile. \"I always believed that scientists were boring people who isolated themselves in their labs, only wore white lab coats their entire lives, and had no social life. I guess the movies we watch stereotype scientists to be nerdy-looking people with glasses or weird messy hair, who talk using long words that nobody understands. I also thought of science as being a hard subject that I could never learn since it did not click into my brain in high school.\" \"I have never been able to relate it to my daily activities ... Although I think scientists and science are parts of this life that I cannot fully understand, I strongly believe that science is the foundation to our society and it is the most important and valuable concept that everyone should grasp to some extent.\" “I've always thought about science as an interesting but confusing subject. I despise how scientists use HUGE words to define what they're trying to explain.“ \"Usually the first thing that comes into my mind when I hear the word 'science' is mixing chemicals and computing data; basically a stereotype.\" “Scientists look strange ... but I believe that it’s a part of their job, because to be able to find out many new details they should be able to think far and in extraordinary ways.” \"Science to me is dull and I feel it's very black and white … I don't think there is any creativity in science or from scientists … there is no thinking outside the box.\" \"Another misconception is that you don't need science in your everyday life. However, I believe that's false because everything revolves around science and without science we would not have answers to many things.\" “The teachers had a huge role … I think a science class all depends on how the information is delivered.” I think these answers are a good representation of what society really thinks about science and scientists. I’ve got the whole semester to try to turn these students into science-literate citizens — and to make them want to gobble up science.

The brightest fires, as observed by the MODIS instrument, are shown in orange and yellow. (Credit: NASA) By Adam Voiland, NASA's Earth Science News Team NASA's latest Earth-observing satellite, the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP), which launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on Oct. 28, will extend key environmental data records established by an earlier generation of NASA satellites. To mark the launch, we are looking back at one of the scientific legacies NPP will build upon: the global fire data record. An instrument on NPP called the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) will extend this decades-long record into the future. For more than a decade, instruments on Terra and Aqua, two of NASA’s flagship Earth-observing satellites, have scanned the surface of our planet for fires four times a day. The instruments, both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS), have revolutionized what scientists know about fire’s role in land cover change, ecosystem processes, and the global carbon cycle by allowing researchers to map the characteristics and global distribution of fires in remarkable detail. The two instruments have detected more than 40 million actively burning fires and observed nearly 10 billion acres of charred land during tens of thousands of orbits. They have extended and refined upon about 20 years of data from a predecessor instrument — the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) — that orbited aboard a series of polar-orbiting weather satellites managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The unique and comprehensive view of fire that MODIS offers is distinct from anything that aircraft or field research can provide. “MODIS data have enabled a tremendous amount of new fire research, and there will be more to come as the records extend into the future,” said Chris Justice, a University of Maryland scientist who has led the effort to use the MODIS instruments to monitor fires. “It’s essential that we maintain the long-term records of active fire and burned area that MODIS has established and continue them with NPP VIIRS if we want to understand where and how fires are responding to climate change and the activities of a growing human population,” he said. Over the last decade, the two MODIS instruments have not only mapped the global distribution of fires in unprecedented detail, they have also produced data that have led to major advances in fields as diverse as climate science, public health, and fire management. Mapping: The Geography of Fire Before AVHRR and MODIS, scientists had no way of mapping the global distribution of fire. The United States, Canada, and some countries in Europe had fairly robust fire monitoring systems that utilized ground-based networks of fire towers and aircraft surveillance, but large portions of the world had little or no monitoring capability. Even in the United States, there were huge gaps in remote parts of the West and throughout much of Alaska. That all began to change in",

The small island off the coastal inlet in the lower left corner of the image is dominated by mangrove swamps, and considered home to protected sea bird sanctuaries. Parts of the island are off-limits for visitors. 2. Settlers were, perhaps, over-optimistic in their naming policy of this country. 3. The body of water shown on the right side of the image is considered so shallow and is situated on a single plate, that it is known for its tranquil calm waters and geologic inactivity. 4. The streams and rivers of this country used to be home to a sacred reptile, which has since gone extinct. 5. For centuries, coastal farmers used a powerful fertilizer that covered the rocks on the tip of this peninsula area during the dry season. Thus giving this area it’s descriptive name. 6. This animal, which can be found in the National Park located just below the bottom right corner of the image, comes down from its perch twice a day to feed its young.

    "content": "By Dr. Erika Podest, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory From the UN conference on climate change, Durban, South Africa The second week of the United Nations conference on climate change, COP17, is focused mostly on negotiating how solutions to climate change will be implemented. The first week (last week) was taken up with technical meetings and position papers. I arrived early on Monday morning and am impressed by the rivers of people lining up to enter the conference. As I look around, I see people young and old from all races and cultures. Every country on Earth is represented here and I hear that around 15,000 people are attending. It seems like everyone that is related to climate change is here. An Earth scientist’s treasure trove of contacts! The goal of COP17 is commitments. Commitments to policy action. Countries need to ensure that they can follow through with previous commitments on agreements by implementing actions at home. It is fitting that COP17 is being hosted in Africa since the continent is expected to experience the impact of climate change much more severely than other regions around the world. In addition, the African population is less prepared to deal with climate disasters, lacking proper infrastructure or excess funds to invest in the issue. There is a dizzying array of events at the conference, to the point where it’s actually overwhelming. An entire pavilion is dedicated to exhibitions housing displays and information booths from government agencies, non-government organizations, international organizations and academic institutions. Another pavilion showcases nations’ efforts on combating climate change, and hosts the main conference center where the negotiations between governments are taking place. The African Pavilion houses an exhibition focused on Africa as well as the US and European Union Centers. In addition, there are lots of side events taking place, addressing climate change, how we can reduce the effects of climate change (“mitigation”), how we can adapt to those changes already happening (“adaptation”) and that are coming down the pipeline, and how we can implement these actions. I wish I could attend everything that is of interest, but I have not yet figured out how to clone myself! The US Center is a Department of State public diplomacy initiative to inform on key climate programs and scientific research, highlighting US efforts to combat climate change. It features a series of events sponsored by organizations such as USGS, NOAA, USAID, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA. The center features the NASA hyperwall, essentially a wall of TVs — 15 high-resolution monitors that help visualize large datasets. Though the US Center has a full daily agenda, 30-minute slots have been allotted between events to showcase data from NASA Earth science satellites and the climate models we work with, covering things like aerosols, the water cycle, glaciers, human impacts on the planet and ocean currents. There are about four NASA hyperwall presentations a day and as docent, I get to provide an explanation of the specific topic displayed. My colleague, Dr. Jack Kaye, from NASA HQ, also shares the responsibility. For the past couple of days, I have spent most of my time at the US center listening to some fascinating talks discussing how to reduce emissions from the world’s forests (see previous entry for more information), clean energy, climate adaptation and mitigation, food security and policy, climate modeling, local community and government action. One of the most interesting talks involved discussion of how the Department of Defense is improving our understanding of climate change, how it can support international climate change adaptation efforts, and how it will respond to the challenges — strategic and operational — that we face because of climate change. Rear Admiral David Titley, director of the Navy’s Climate Change Task Force, gave an excellent talk about climate change and its effects on military resources, emphasizing the need for military readiness to such changes. I was impressed by his candor and straightforward nature in addressing issues faced by the Navy in the face of climate change. This may be the last chance to salvage the Kyoto Protocol and a meaningful binding international deal on emissions.

NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey are using satellite technology to monitor the changing resources. Every three seconds, the world loses a football-field sized swath of forest. As forests are cut for fuel or burned to allow the planting of crops, the Earth loses the ability of forests to capture carbon from the atmosphere or to support biodiversity with an untold loss of plant and animal species. The fate of world forests is just one concern linked to population growth. With the United Nations (U.N.) declaring that seven billion people now live on our planet, the question becomes: How can Earth resources be managed best to support so many? \"Feeding the people of the world requires not only land for agriculture, but it also requires fresh water and energy,\" said James Irons, Landsat project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

By looking at how the Earth's climate responded to past natural changes, Hansen sought insight into a fundamental question raised by ongoing human-caused climate change: \"What is the dangerous level of global warming?\" Some international leaders have suggested a goal of limiting warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times in order to avert catastrophic change. But Hansen said at a press briefing at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco recently that a warming of two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) would lead to drastic changes, such as significant ice sheet loss in Greenland and Antarctica.

So I take the time to explain to them the kind of Earth science research that we do, which is primarily satellite-focused, and I proudly point them to NASA’s Climate Change website. As I roam around the conference premises, I run into activists chanting songs and slogans. They were given a predefined time and space, therefore they are no confrontations with police.

    "content": "By Dr. Erika Podest, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory From the UN conference on climate change, Durban, South Africa The highlight of my day was being part of a panel discussion on “Viewing the Earth’s Climate from Space”, a NASA-sponsored event that provided an overview of space-based studies of the Earth’s climate system. The talks emphasized not only a global perspective, but the perspective from Africa as well. The panel was comprised of scientists Dr. Jack Kaye from NASA headquarters, Dr. Jeff Privette from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Dr. Yann Kerr from France’s Centre d’Etudes Spatiales de la BIOsphère, and me from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Our presentations covered a wide variety of science ‘products’ derived from satellite datasets that tell us about Earth’s climate. Jack Kaye gave a broad overview of NASA’s current abilities to study and monitor different aspects of Earth from space. I focused on the components of the water cycle that we can see from space, such as rainfall, snow, groundwater and soil moisture, and the way in which they affect vegetation growth, drought and floods. I also talked about the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission, a mission being led by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory that will study soil moisture from space. Jeff Privette, from NOAA’s National Climate Data Center, brought the discussion into an operational context, emphasizing the key role of NOAA satellite data in monitoring our climate over multiple years. Finally, Yann Kerr talked about Europe’s satellite capabilities and the most recent results from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The panel presentation was done on the hyperwall, which was an ideal venue to showcase the satellite products discussed. I thought our presentation went over very well — the room was packed and the audience engaged. After the presentation a number of questions were posed by audience members and by viewers in different countries who were watching the presentation as it was broadcasted online. The other highlight of my day was giving a short hyperwall presentation on NASA satellites and then handing the podium to a panel discussion titled “Unlocking the Potential of Women to Combat Climate Change.” The panel was comprised of the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues, Mellane Verveer; the former President of Ireland, the honorary Mary Robinson; Socorro Flores Liera, Director General for Global Affairs for Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Winnie Byanyima, Director of the United Nations Development Programme Gender Team; Bineta Diop, Executive Director and founder of Femmes Africa Solidarité; and other luminaries. The discussion focused on empowering women socially, politically and economically in the face of climate change. I was honored to hand the floor to such an extraordinary group of women. Had it been a rock concert, I would have felt like I was the opening band for U2. Today was also the last day of the U.S. Center operations and all equipment was shut down after the last evening panel discussion. I was saddened that operations had come to an end but I was also very impressed to see how flawlessly everything had run. The State Department did an excellent job in organizing the US Center; each event had been meticulously planned and coordinated and the schedule ran like a Swiss clock. In addition, I think that the NASA hyperwall provided a unique opportunity for people to see NASA's capabilities to study Earth through satellite images. It also provided the wow factor that was unmatched to any other display at the conference.

Apparently all the scientists are early birds because the parking is horrendous by the time I get there. If I show up to work at 10 or even 9 in the morning I am forced to park in the dreaded East Lot. Then to get to my cubicle is no easy task. Hiking is a good way to describe the 10-minute power walk I endure while going over a few hills and making swift turns. When I go over the river and through the woods I come across the turnstiles. The cold metal bars prevent my entry and the only way to pass them is with my badge. Yes, Jet Propulsion Laboratory has very high security and yes, I do wonder from time to time what will happen if my badge suddenly doesn’t read. I would then be forced to answer to the officer behind the slightly tinted window, who seems to be watching my every move. I had this preconceived notion that people would be walking around in lab coats muttering under their breaths with their eyes glued to the floor. Imagine my surprise when I find out that JPL consists of a very casual work environment. People don’t even dress professionally. Some men wear shorts and Hawaiian shirts in the summer and the women don’t necessarily wear heels. When walking outside, it is not uncommon to see an occasional herd of deer just nonchalantly eating grass. When I first came here I was amazed and whipped out my phone to take pictures, when I realized that the people around me just walk right past them as if this is as normal as a bird singing in a tree. I’ve done so many memorable things here where I wonder how could one have so much fun and still call it work? We’ve had salsa contests where people bring in homemade salsa and we can be the judge and vote for our favorites (being a judge has obvious benefits). We’ve had parties honoring the tenth anniversary of the Jason satellite launch where we all sat around and ate cake and drank punch. My internship allowed me to take part in a bunch of meetings with different scientists. One weekly meeting I would attend consisted of a large number of ocean scientists who got together in a room and discussed their latest research. During my time here, I've worked on NASA's climate change website, helping communicate science to the general public. I have posted Energy Innovation articles on our website and helped assist in the production of videos that are on our Climate Reel page. Informing the public about all the (Earth) science that goes on at JPL is a very important task and can help improve our planet’s well-being. I have had just the best experiences at JPL and it is with a heavy heart that I bid adieu to my fellow JPL-ers. Change is always on the horizon and hopefully I can use the knowledge I gained here to make a difference in the world.

    "content": "By Alan Buis Jet Propulsion Laboratory A new university-led study with NASA participation finds ancient Antarctica was much warmer and wetter than previously suspected. The climate was suitable to support substantial vegetation -- including stunted trees -- along the edges of the frozen continent. The team of scientists involved in the study, published online June 17 in Nature Geoscience, was led by Sarah J. Feakins of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and included researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. By examining plant leaf wax remnants in sediment core samples taken from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, the research team found summer temperatures along the Antarctic coast 15 to 20 million years ago were 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) warmer than today, with temperatures reaching as high as 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). Precipitation levels also were found to be several times higher than today. \"The ultimate goal of the study was to better understand what the future of climate change may look like,\" said Feakins, an assistant professor of Earth sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. \"Just as history has a lot to teach us about the future, so does past climate. This record shows us how much warmer and wetter it can get around the Antarctic ice sheet as the climate system heats up. This is some of the first evidence of just how much warmer it was.\" Scientists began to suspect that high-latitude temperatures during the middle Miocene epoch were warmer than previously believed when co-author Sophie Warny, assistant professor at LSU, discovered large quantities of pollen and algae in sediment cores taken around Antarctica. Fossils of plant life in Antarctica are difficult to come by because the movement of the massive ice sheets covering the landmass grinds and scrapes away the evidence. \"Marine sediment cores are ideal to look for clues of past vegetation, as the fossils deposited are protected from ice sheet advances, but these are technically very difficult to acquire in the Antarctic and require international collaboration,\" said Warny. Tipped off by the tiny pollen samples, Feakins opted to look at the remnants of leaf wax taken from sediment cores for clues. Leaf wax acts as a record of climate change by documenting the hydrogen isotope ratios of the water the plant took up while it was alive. \"Ice cores can only go back about one million years,\" Feakins said. \"Sediment cores allow us to go into 'deep time.'\" Based upon a model originally developed to analyze hydrogen isotope ratios in atmospheric water vapor data from NASA's Aura spacecraft, co-author and JPL scientist Jung-Eun Lee created experiments to find out just how much warmer and wetter climate may have been. \"When the planet heats up, the biggest changes are seen toward the poles,\" Lee said. \"The southward movement of rain bands associated with a warmer climate in the high-latitude southern hemisphere made the margins of Antarctica less like a polar desert, and more like present-day Iceland.\" The peak of this Antarctic greening occurred during the middle Miocene period, between 16.4 and 15.7 million years ago. This was well after the age of the dinosaurs, which became extinct 64 million years ago. During the Miocene epoch, mostly modern-looking animals roamed Earth, such as three-toed horses, deer, camel and various species of apes. Modern humans did not appear until 200,000 years ago. Warm conditions during the middle Miocene are thought to be associated with carbon dioxide levels of around 400 to 600 parts per million (ppm). In",

Credit: Sean Smith/ NASA By Jennifer LaPan, NASA's Langley Research Center Scientists at NASA have added yet another instrument to an expanding climate research hub at NASA's Langley Research Center, putting Hampton, Va., on the map in a worldwide network of atmospheric measurements. The network of instruments exists under the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) program, which is dedicated to studying tiny particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols. Despite their small size, aerosols have a major impact on air quality and human health and also affect Earth's climate. \"Our primary objective is understanding the properties of aerosols,\" said Brent Holben, the project scientist who leads the AERONET program at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"The more instruments we have, the easier it is to address those questions about their size, shape and radiative properties.\" AERONET consists of more than 500 aerosol-measuring sites across 80 countries and all seven continents, each hosting the exact same instrument to take measurements of aerosols over that particular area. NASA scientists who work with data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite are particularly excited about the addition of the AERONET instrument to NASA Langley's ground research site, known as CAPABLE (Chemistry and Physics Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment). \"CALIPSO studies aerosols in the atmosphere too,\" says Ali Omar, a CALIPSO scientist and the principal investigator for the AERONET instrument at NASA Langley. \"If CALIPSO passes by, even within 50 to 100 miles, we can make a comparison between its retrievals and the AERONET measurements of aerosol properties.\" Omar said the closest ground-based AERONET instrument up to this point was at NASA's COVE (CERES Ocean Validation Experiment) site, an ocean research platform at the mouth of Virginia's Chesapeake Bay. \"The dominant aerosol type at the COVE site is marine, and dominant types at the CAPABLE site are urban and marine,\" said Omar. Omar said that marine aerosols consist of sea salt, while urban aerosols, largely generated by fossil-fuel combustion, consist of sulfates, nitrates, and organic and black carbon. The addition of AERONET instruments allows the network to help more satellites confirm and refine their aerosols measurements. \"All satellites have different requirements and different footprints, so one AERONET instrument doesn't always fall in the footprint of a satellite. If we have a large distribution of instruments, we are likely to get a hit,\" said Holben. The new AERONET instrument at Langley joins a suite of instruments at the CAPABLE site, which monitor weather and air quality. In",

After a quiet July, the Atlantic has seen a sharp increase in tropical activity. With the heart of the hurricane season now here, two tropical systems are currently making their way through the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Isaac and TD10 (the 10th tropical depression of the season). During the peak of the season, more storms form further out in the central Atlantic from tropical waves, known as African easterly waves, that move off of the coast of Africa and make their way westward across the tropical Atlantic. These disturbances are often the precursors for tropical storms and hurricanes. The last six storms that formed, including Isaac and TD 10, all formed in August, all originated as African easterly waves, and all formed out over the central tropical Atlantic. Isaac formed from a tropical wave that moved off of the coast of Africa on Aug. 17. Four days later on the morning of Aug. 21, the wave had intensified and developed enough of a circulation to become a tropical depression, TD 9. Later that same day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Isaac with sustained winds reported at 35 knots (~40 mph). Isaac then continued to track westward through the central Atlantic towards the Lesser Antilles. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (or TRMM) satellite captured an image of Isaac as it was nearing the Lesser Antilles early on the morning of Aug. 22.

He is a proud member of a team of scientists who develop algorithms for this unique instrument that probes Earth’s atmosphere using pulses of laser light. I was a musician working at a Pizza Hut before beginning college which, in my case, was synonymous with poor. Looking for a brighter future (i.e., more money), I enrolled at Kansas State University as a computer systems major. The alluring thing about this major for me was that it required creative problem solving and had the promise of big bucks. During my time there I learned about programming and computer hardware. However, the most important thing to happen to me was a course I took in calculus. Before I started college I assumed that math wasn’t for me. As it turned out, I found mathematics very intuitive. I enjoyed the creativity and elegance that came with problem solving, much like the creativity I enjoyed playing music. My original childhood passion was astronomy, and if I enjoyed mathematics then I reasoned that I could do well studying astronomy or physics. With this in mind, I wrapped up my associates degree in computer systems and changed majors to physics in which I earned my bachelor’s degree. I became interested in the physics of light and lasers, so I did research as an undergraduate in a high-intensity ultrafast laser facility at the James R. Macdonald Laboratory at Kansas State University. I wrote computer code for graduate researchers that helped with their experiments and also spent six months assembling a laser system. In graduate school, atmospheric science was an attractive path because I could apply the physics I learned to important problems such as climate and climate change. When I sent out my application to graduate schools, my soon-to-be advisor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign saw that I had experience with lasers and thought that I could work with data from the new (at the time) CALIPSO satellite which uses lasers to study the atmosphere. I hadn’t thought about working with satellites before I met him, but because it sounded interesting and involved lasers and the physics of the atmosphere, I jumped on board. I spent the next two years studying CALIPSO measurements to learn how aerosol properties change near clouds – a topic of significant uncertainty in climate science. Eventually, I was ready to look for a job and, as it happened, an opportunity opened up for an analyst with the CALIPSO science team at NASA Langley Research Center. Since I had been working with CALIPSO data for two years and my interest in optics and aerosols fit in well with the team, I was offered the job, which I eagerly accepted – and every day since I have been glad that I did. Working for the CALIPSO satellite mission is very exciting. I get to find creative solutions to complicated problems and work with scientists to understand what data from CALIPSO is telling us about Earth’s atmosphere. In April",

Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech By Alan Buis, Jet Propulsion Laboratory PASADENA, Calif. – A new analysis led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., has estimated how much the growth of plants worldwide is limited by the amount of nutrients available in their soil. The maps produced from the research will be particularly useful in evaluating how much carbon dioxide Earth's ecosystems may be able to soak up as greenhouse gas levels increase. A research team led by JPL research scientist Josh Fisher used 19 years of data from NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and international satellites to assess the maximum possible growth of vegetation all over the world based upon available water and light conditions. The scientists then cross-compared that potential maximum with observed vegetation productivity as measured by satellites. This is the first time such an analysis has been conducted. The map, published recently in the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles, shows the places where vegetation productivity was less than the potential maximum, and then infers that the vegetation in those places was limited by the amount of available soil nutrients there. Results of the study were evaluated using measurements of nutrients and vegetation productivity taken at ground validation sites in Hawaii. NASA has determined the limits to the growth of vegetation around the world based upon the availability of nutrients in vegetation soils. The nutrient limitation maps significantly advance global carbon cycle and climate models. Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \"There are many regions on Earth where vegetation struggles to reach optimum productivity because of sparse nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorus,\" said Fisher. \"This reduces global vegetation productivity by nearly a quarter compared to vegetation in a completely fertile Earth.\" Fisher said the research is valuable for studying the global carbon cycle. \"Current global carbon cycle models do not, for the most part, account for the cycling of nutrients, so the terrestrial biosphere (forests and other ecosystems) is expected to absorb an increasing amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide,\" he said. \"Our approach provides a way to assess the performance of global carbon models that incorporate the cycling of nutrients to ensure that they accurately reflect the impacts that sparse nutrients have on plant growth.\" The team found that tropical forests were more nutrient-limited than boreal forests, though the range in the amount of nutrients was much larger for boreal forests than tropical forests. North American forests were more nutrient-limited than Eurasian forests. Savannas, grasslands and shrublands had the fewest nutrients, and croplands had the most. \"We were able to detect known regional gradients in nutrient levels -- an East-West gradient across Amazonia, fertilization differences between 'developed' and 'developing' countries, and the migration of trees in boreal North America, for example,\" said co-author Grayson Badgley of Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif. \"It is interesting that we can glean insight on global nutrient cycles from satellite observations of global water and carbon cycles,\" said co-author Eleanor Blyth of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford.

Identifying leads is one of the necessary steps in preparing IceBridge’s quick look sea ice thickness data product. Credit: NASA / DMS team By George Hale, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Shrinking Arctic sea ice grabbed the world's attention again earlier this year with a new record low minimum. Growing economic activity in the Arctic, such as fishing, mineral exploration and shipping, is emphasizing the need for accurate predictions of how much of the Arctic will be covered by sea ice. Every June, an international research group known as the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) publishes a summary of the expected September Arctic sea ice minimum known as the Sea Ice Outlook. The initial reports and monthly updates aim to give the scientific community and public the best available information on sea ice. Researchers rely on models that use estimated ice thickness data and simulated atmospheric conditions to forecast how sea ice will change during the summer. For the first time, near real-time ice thickness data obtained by NASA's Operation IceBridge has been used to correct a forecast model's initial measurements, which could lead to improved seasonal predictions. In a paper published last month in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, Ron Lindsay, IceBridge science team member and Arctic climatologist with the Polar Science Center at the University of Washington in Seattle, outlined efforts to use IceBridge data to improve the accuracy of seasonal sea ice forecasts. Lindsay and colleagues used a new quick look sea ice data product that IceBridge scientists released before the end of the Arctic campaign earlier this year. The quick look data, intended for use in time-sensitive applications like seasonal forecasts, supplements the final sea ice data product typically released roughly six months after the campaign. By using new data processing techniques, IceBridge scientists were able to publish the quick look measurements in a matter of weeks. \"The idea was to make the data available for anyone to use for the Sea Ice Outlook,\" said sea ice scientist Nathan Kurtz of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The work outlined in Lindsay's paper marks the first use of IceBridge quick look data in an ensemble sea ice forecast (computer) model. \"An ensemble forecast is where you run a single forecast model many different times,\" said Lindsay. In this case, they ran the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) model seven times using conditions from previous summers. PIOMAS uses sea ice extent, the area of sea containing sea ice, and atmospheric data to simulate ice and ocean conditions. IceBridge data and thickness measurements made by the Seasonal Ice Zone Observing Network (SIZONet), a multidisciplinary project aimed at observing Arctic sea ice, served as a way to correct initial sea ice conditions. These initial measurements come from running the forecast model with historical atmospheric conditions. Lindsay and colleagues used IceBridge and SIZONet data to adjust these measurements and then used the PIOMAS model to create a forecast of September's mean sea ice extent. To make sure what effect the corrected measurements had, they also ran the model as normal, something known as a control run. Careful Measurements Before this forecasting work could begin though, the researchers had to gather and process data, something that takes the hard work of many people. During March and April of",

(NASA / Carla Thomas) By Steve Cole, Headquarters Ruth Dasso Marlaire, Ames Research Center WASHINGTON -- Starting this month, NASA will send a remotely piloted research aircraft as high as 65,000 feet over the tropical Pacific Ocean to probe unexplored regions of the upper atmosphere for answers to how a warming climate is changing Earth. The first flights of the Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX), a multi-year airborne science campaign with a heavily instrumented Global Hawk aircraft, will take off from and be operated by NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Global Hawk is able to make 30-hour flights. Water vapor and ozone in the stratosphere can have a large impact on Earth's climate. The processes that drive the rise and fall of these compounds, especially water vapor, are not well understood. This limits scientists' ability to predict how these changes will influence global climate in the future. ATTREX will study moisture and chemical composition in the upper regions of the troposphere, the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. The tropopause layer between the troposphere and stratosphere, 8 miles to 11 miles above Earth's surface, is the point where water vapor, ozone and other gases enter the stratosphere. Studies have shown even small changes in stratospheric humidity may have significant climate impacts. Predictions of stratospheric humidity changes are uncertain because of gaps in the understanding of the physical processes occurring in the tropical tropopause layer. ATTREX will use the Global Hawk to carry instruments to sample this layer near the equator off the coast of Central America. \"The ATTREX payload will provide unprecedented measurements of the tropical tropopause,\" said Eric Jensen, ATTREX principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. \"This is our first opportunity to sample the tropopause region during winter in the northern hemisphere when it is coldest and extremely dry air enters the stratosphere.\" Led by Jensen and project manager Dave Jordan of Ames, ATTREX scientists installed 11 instruments in the Global Hawk.

There is, however, a dawning realization among researchers that even these apparently tiny variations can have a significant effect on terrestrial climate. A new report issued by the National Research Council (NRC), \"The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate,\" lays out some of the surprisingly complex ways that solar activity can make itself felt on our planet. These six extreme UV images of the sun, taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, track the rising level of solar activity as the sun ascends toward the peak of the latest 11-year sunspot cycle. Understanding the sun-climate connection requires a breadth of expertise in fields such as plasma physics, solar activity, atmospheric chemistry and fluid dynamics, energetic particle physics, and even terrestrial history. No single researcher has the full range of knowledge required to solve the problem. To make progress, the NRC had to assemble dozens of experts from many fields at a single workshop. The report summarizes their combined efforts to frame the problem in a truly multi-disciplinary context. One of the participants, Greg Kopp of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, pointed out that while the variations in luminosity over the 11-year solar cycle amount to only a tenth of a percent of the sun's total output, such a small fraction is still important. \"Even typical short term variations of 0.1% in incident irradiance exceed all other energy sources (such as natural radioactivity in Earth's core) combined,\" he says.

Of particular importance is the sun's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, which peaks during the years around solar maximum. Within the relatively narrow band of EUV wavelengths, the sun’s output varies not by a minuscule 0.1%, but by whopping factors of 10 or more. This can strongly affect the chemistry and thermal structure of the upper atmosphere.

These data have been corrected for calibration offsets between the various instruments used to measure TSI. SOURCE: Courtesy of Greg Kopp, University of Colorado. Several researchers discussed how changes in the upper atmosphere can trickle down to Earth's surface. There are many \"top-down\" pathways for the sun's influence. For instance, Charles Jackman of the Goddard Space Flight Center described how nitrogen oxides (NOx) created by solar energetic particles and cosmic rays in the stratosphere could reduce ozone levels by a few percent. Because ozone absorbs UV radiation, less ozone means that more UV rays from the sun would reach Earth's surface. Isaac Held of NOAA took this one step further. He described how loss of ozone in the stratosphere could alter the dynamics of the atmosphere below it. \"The cooling of the polar stratosphere associated with loss of ozone increases the horizontal temperature gradient near the tropopause,” he explains. “This alters the flux of angular momentum by mid-latitude eddies. [Angular momentum is important because] the angular momentum budget of the troposphere controls the surface westerlies.\" In other words, solar activity felt in the upper atmosphere can, through a complicated series of influences, push surface storm tracks off course.

Credit: NASA. NASA scientists and two research aircraft are on their way to a unique natural laboratory off the Atlantic coast of southwest Africa to study a major unknown in future climate prediction. The coast of Namibia is one of three places on Earth with persistent low-level clouds, and the only such location with a steady supply of tiny aerosol particles in the form of smoke from inland fires that mix with the clouds. NASA's Observations of Aerosols Above Clouds and their Interactions (ORACLES) mission will observe and measure how these particles interact with clouds and change their ability to warm or cool the planet. \"This is the perfect natural laboratory to study aerosol-cloud interactions, which are some of the largest uncertainties in the prediction of future climate,\" said Jens Redemann, ORACLES principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. Some aerosols, such as dust and sea salt, have a natural origin. But others, such as soot and smoke released by fires and industry, are the result of human activities. Once aerosols enter the atmosphere, they can cause either a warming or cooling effect. \"Human activities currently are estimated to be responsible for perhaps half of all the aerosol particles in the atmosphere,\" said Robert Wood, a cloud scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle and ORACLES deputy principal investigator. \"Smoke particles both reflect sunlight back to space, thus cooling the Earth, and absorb sunlight, which has the opposite effect of warming the Earth. When aerosols encounter clouds, they also change the properties of the clouds they are ingested into.\" Understanding which effect is dominant, and under what conditions, is essential for improving the regional and global computer models that predict what may occur with future climate change. Changes in the properties of the cloud layer caused by aerosols could also have an effect on regional coastal fisheries by altering the amount of sunlight reaching the ocean surface that drives currents and ocean upwelling. The initially separate cloud and aerosol layers off the Namibian coast are relatively stable. As the cloud layers thicken away from shore like a wedge, it gradually mixes with the aerosol layer. The result is a range of steadily changing conditions that allow the ORACLES science team to probe several different types of cloud-aerosol interactions. The ORACLES field campaign is based out of Walvis Bay in Namibia, where faculty and students from Namibian universities will be working alongside the ORACLES team. The project team has built new relationships with African colleagues, in particular, the Namibia University of Science and Technology in Windhoek. University personnel support logistics for ORACLES field work and will collaborate in data analysis and modeling. The Gobabeb Research and Training Centre in the Namib Desert, which previously has worked with NASA using the desert as an analog for the surface of other planets, is providing ground-based remote sensing of the atmosphere. \"Science is a great unifier,\" said Bernadette Squire Luna, ORACLES project manager at Ames. \"We are building relationships with Namibian scientists that will outlast this project and will lead to yet more science and more interactions. We're connecting our countries in a very grassroots way.\" NASA's P-3 aircraft, managed by the agency’s Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Virginia, carries five remote sensing instruments and flies through the cloud and aerosol layers at up to 20,000 feet to gather direct measurements from more than a dozen cloud and aerosol probes attached to the wings and inlets on the windows. NASA's ER-2 aircraft, managed by the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, will fly at 65,000 feet with instruments that make measurements similar to those acquired from satellites. ORACLES flights will complement and validate current satellite observations of aerosols and clouds, and test instruments that may fly on future satellites, by making detailed observations that are impossible to make from space with current capabilities. Unlike a satellite, which generally gets one pass per day over a certain location, both aircraft will be able to sample clouds and aerosols throughout the day over the entire study area to see how they evolve. Together, data from the two aircraft will provide a comprehensive picture of how aerosols behave in the presence of clouds – and how aerosols directly or indirectly change how clouds behave. ORACLES is a collaborative research effort that involves more than a hundred scientists from five NASA centers, two national laboratories, 10 U.S. universities, and five African research institutions. It’s a multi-year NASA Earth Venture suborbital investigation to probe Earth system processes that are not completely understood. These flights from Namibia are the first of several planned field seasons for the mission. Earth Venture investigations are part of NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder program managed at the agency’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

    "content": "From NASA's Earth Observatory Though thunderstorms are familiar and seemingly non-threatening, severe thunderstorms can lead to dangerous supercells, derechos, and tornadoes. Severe thunderstorms are defined as having sustained winds above 93 kilometers (58 miles) per hour or unusually large hail, and there are two key factors that fuel their formation: convective available potential energy (CAPE) and strong wind shear. CAPE is a measure of how much raw energy is available for storms; it relates to how warm, moist, and buoyant air is in a given area. Wind shear is a measure of how the speed and direction of winds change with altitude. “CAPE can provide storms with the raw fuel to produce rain and hail, and vertical wind shear can pull and twist weak storms into strong, windy ones,” explained Harold Brooks, a meteorologist at NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory. Scientists have evidence that global warming should increase CAPE by warming the surface and putting more moisture in the air through evaporation. On the other hand, disproportionate warming in the Arctic should lead to less wind shear in mid-latitude areas prone to severe thunderstorms. So one factor makes severe storms more likely, while the other makes them less so. Researchers have developed detailed climate models (results shown above) that aim to distinguish which of these opposing effects will dominate as the climate changes. One study, led by Robert Trapp of Purdue University, found that a doubling of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would significantly increase the number of days that severe thunderstorms could occur in the southern and eastern United States. Cities such as Atlanta and New York could see a doubling of the number of days that severe thunderstorms could occur. The maps above show the results of a model comparing the summer climate in",

    "content": "Coral reefs are busy underwater ecosystems. Some people call them the \"rainforests of the sea.\" The corals look like rocks but actually are animals. They have hard calcium carbonate skeletons like clams. They form a base for lots of other organisms to live. You'll find crabs, sea stars, worms, clams, sponges, jellies, sea turtles, and lots of fish. Coral reefs are complicated and very fragile. They are easily affected by pollution. In the world's many deserts, there is very little rain. The land is very, very dry. Here, living things have creative ways of finding and saving water. Cactuses are very good at storing water. They can live without rain for months. The kangaroo mouse lives in the Nevada desert. It never needs to drink water. It can get all its water from the seeds it eats. Every continent except Antarctica has grasslands. These are areas with medium rainfall. You'll find many different types of tall grasses, herbs, and flowers all mixed together. From the savannahs of Africa to the prairies of Kansas, grasslands are home to lots of different species that live in the soil, feed on the grass, or eat the animals that eat the grass. In the United States, that could be buffalos and cows. In Africa, it's gazelles, lions, and elephants. Ponds, lakes, streams, and rivers are home to lots of different species that can't live in salty ocean water. There are freshwater ecosystems all over the world. They are home to some amazing creatures. There are many kinds of frogs, fish, insects, and microscopic organisms like amoebas. And there are rare species like river dolphins in Asia and South America, otters in North America, beavers in North America and Europe, and platypuses in Australia. In the tundra, it feels like winter all the time. Tundra occurs near the north and south poles of our planet. We call them the Arctic and Antarctic tundra. There is also tundra at the top of the world's tallest mountains. It's a hard place to live. There are short but hardy shrubs, mosses, and lichens. In the Arctic tundra, there are polar bears, foxes, and reindeer. In the Antarctic tundra, there are seals and penguins resting on the shores between swims in the ocean. At the bottom of the ocean, there are small underwater volcanoes spewing scalding hot water, gases, and chemicals like methane and ammonia. They're called hydrothermal vents. It's a dark place to live, but some animals love it there. Giant tube worms over 6 feet (1.8 meters) long, clams, and shrimp call these vents home. The tube worms have bacteria inside them that make food out of the methane and ammonia from the vents. Swamps, marshes, and bogs are types of wetlands. Wetlands can have freshwater, salt water, or a mixture of both. They are home to lots of different aquatic plants and animals. Wetlands can serve as nurseries for lots of animals. Fish, frogs, alligators, and crocodiles lay eggs here. It's a great place for the babies to hatch and grow. They are also home to many different kinds of insects like dragonflies. Much of North America, Europe, and Asia is in a temperate region, between the Arctic and subtropics. Here, the weather is generally not too hot, not too cold, with distinct seasons. There are many big forests. The trees here are usually pine, spruce, and larch. They are green all year around and have needles instead of leaves. Animals like bears, porcupines, and eagles make homes in these vast forests. Tropical rainforests are near the equator where it's almost always warm and wet. These are the key ingredients for making lots of lush plants and trees. Half of the whole world's species live in tropical rainforests. It's a very busy ecosystem with many kinds of plants, animals, fungi, and microscopic organisms. Many of them live here and nowhere else. The plants in tropical rainforests produce 40% of Earth's oxygen. Big cities around the world have interesting ecosystems too. There are many animals that share living spaces with people near roads, houses, and buildings. In many cities, raccoons, coyotes, opossums, skunks, foxes, birds, and all sorts of insects are common neighbors. And in some places, people build wildlife crossings. These are special bridges over roads that animals can use. It lets them move between places without getting hurt by cars.  This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

But after years of research and development NASA is poised to equip some of its most important deep space missions with ion engines that can nudge spacecraft using charged particles accelerated to blistering speeds of up to 90,000 miles per hour. And in the vastness of space, those engines need to push continuously for years. NASA’s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) project, managed at NASA’s Glenn Research Center, has completed a test that powered the ion engine for over 48,000 hours. That’s five and a half years of thruster operation, making it the longest duration test of any space propulsion system in history. What makes this milestone truly amazing is how little fuel it used. NEXT consumed 860 kg of xenon propellant. A conventional rocket would require 10,000 kg of propellant to provide the same amount of total momentum. By providing low, constant thrust over long periods of time, electric propulsion engines such as NEXT can accelerate spacecraft using less than a tenth of the propellant of a chemical rocket. To bring this into perspective, compare the young hot rod driver with a little old lady. The hot rod speedster slams on the accelerator burning up fuel quickly and then cruises after getting up to speed. The old lady continuously pushes on the gas pedal ever so gently, slowly increasing the speed of the car. Considering the distances in space, the old lady will eventually surpass the hot rod and travel deeper into space on less fuel.

    "content": "4 min read While the threat of rising seas is well established, a phenomenon that is, in a sense, its opposite receives far fewer headlines: large coastal cities sinking faster than oceans can rise. That is the conclusion of a review article published by a team of scientists who recently assembled in New Orleans, La., and in Venice, Italy, to examine the problem. Extraction of groundwater or fossil fuels, and sometimes simply generations of farming, are causing large metropolitan areas in coastal zones around the world to subside surprisingly quickly—making the relative rise of adjacent seas an even greater potential hazard. “Sea level rise is a problem, and subsidence is a huge problem, too,” said Cathleen Jones, a researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena who specializes in such hazards and is a member of the New Orleans team. “There are areas where it is happening more rapidly than sea level rise,” she said. “I think it is not fully appreciated how much greater subsidence is in some of these areas, and how much it contributes to the loss of wetlands.” Rapid subsidence makes many of these areas more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially those at elevations less than 10 meters (33 feet) above sea level. Several of these qualify as “megacities,” with populations greater than 10 million. The most threatened: large river deltas, home to an estimated 500 million people. The fastest subsidence rate, 250 millimeters or nearly 10 inches per year, was seen in China’s Huanghe Delta. Southeast Asia saw 30 to 60 millimeters (1.2 to 2.4 inches) per year, while Katrina-ravaged portions of New Orleans saw rates as high as 35 millimeters (1.4 inches) per year.

    "content": "By Lisa-Natalie Anjozian, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center One of the world's longest migrations of zebras occurs in the African nation of Botswana, but predicting when and where zebras will move has not been possible until now. Using NASA rain and vegetation data, researchers can track when and where arid lands begin to green, and for the first time anticipate if zebras will make the trek or, if the animals find poor conditions en route, understand why they will turn back. Researchers used cues gleaned from GPS tracking of the zebras and satellite data to predict when the zebras will be on the move, a powerful tool for conservation. Covering an area of approximately 8,500 square miles (22,000 square kilometers), Botswana’s Okavango Delta is one end of the second-longest zebra migration on Earth, a 360-mile (580-kilometer) round trip to the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans—the largest salt pan system on the planet. Zebras walk an unmarked route that takes them to the next best place for grazing, while overhead thundering cloudbursts of late October rains drive new plant growth, filling pockmarks across this largest inland delta in the world. In a matter of weeks, the flooded landscape could yield ecosystems flush with forage for the muscled movers. High above, Earth-orbiting satellites capture images of the zebras' movements on this epic trek, as well as the daily change in environmental conditions. Zebras don’t need data to know when it’s time to find better forage: The surge of rain-coaxed grasses greening is their prompt to depart. But now, researchers are able to take that data and predict when the zebras will move. Pieter Beck, research associate with the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Mass., and three collaborators studied animal migration in a novel way, which they described in a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research--Biogeoscences, a publication of the American Geophysical Union. While tracking animal movement with satellites has been accomplished many times, Beck said, he and his team combined that information with in-depth use of environmental satellite data, using a series of images of vegetation growth and rainfall taken over days and weeks. This sheds unprecedented light on what drives animals to migrate, he said, what cues they use, and how animal migrations respond to environmental change.

Hoping to improve future predictions of climate change, scientists in the NASA study are using the skies over much of the southern United States as a natural laboratory this month and into September. They are grappling with one of the tougher factors driving Earth's climate engine: the seasonal push of a complex soup of gases and particles high into the atmosphere when regional weather systems and pollution sources are particularly strong. The ambitious airborne science campaign is called SEAC4RS, which stands for the Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys. The field campaign draws together coordinated observations from NASA satellites, aircraft, and an array of ground sites. More than 250 scientists, engineers, and flight personnel are participating in the mission. Brian Toon of the University of Colorado Boulder is SEAC4RS lead scientist. DC-8 pilot surveys the scene below during the Aug. 12 flight. Image Credit: NASA / Lauren Harnett The Aug. 12 flight took two NASA planes and one commercial research aircraft over the Gulf of Mexico coast of Louisiana and into northern Georgia and Alabama. The main target of this flight was sampling air chemistry in the Southeast, which is a mix of natural and human sources. Natural emissions of the carbon compound isoprene from forests in the region can change the chemical balance of the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer if lofted high enough. NASA's DC-8 flying laboratory and high-altitude ER-2 aircraft sampled the air with dozens of instruments and a Learjet from SPEC Inc. of Boulder, Colo., measured cloud and aerosol properties. Other targets of the flight were a plume of urban air pollution from Birmingham, Ala., and a growing thunderstorm cloud. Convective storms are a key mechanism for lofting pollution and gases high into the atmosphere. The first SEAC4RS science flight took place on Aug. 6 from the NASA planes' home base at Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility in southern California. The flight sampled the extensive and thick smoke plumes from forest fires burning in southern Oregon and northern California. The smoke is made up of airborne particles that can absorb incoming and reflected energy from the sun, alternately warming and cooling the atmosphere. The particles can also change the properties of clouds they flow into, altering their reflective properties. ER-2 pilot in pressurized suit prepares for Aug. 12 SEAC4RS flight. Image Credit: NASA / James Blair Scientists using NASA satellite data and climate models project that drier conditions in a warming climate are likely to cause increased forest fire activity across the United States in coming decades. Scientists want to take a closer look at what is emitted from large forest fires and how the materials interact. The second science flight occurred on Aug. 8 as the ER-2 and DC-8 flew from California to Houston, where they will be based for the remainder of the mission. As the planes flew across the U.S. Southwest, they studied the large-scale North American Monsoon weather system, a phenomenon that provides significant rainfall to the region, particularly from July until September, and pumps air high into the atmosphere. A special target during this transit flight was a plume of dust from the Saharan Desert over Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. The DC-8 sampled the dust by flying through the plume while the ER-2 observed it remotely from above. SEAC4RS is sponsored by the Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Partial support comes from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.

Atmospheric rivers — short-lived wind tunnels that carry water vapor from the tropical oceans to mid-latitude land areas — are prolific producers of rain and snow on California's Sierra Nevada mountains. The finding, published in the journal Water Resources Research, has major implications for water management in the West, where Sierra runoff is used for drinking water, agriculture and hydropower. The research team studied how two of the most common atmospheric circulation patterns in the Northern Hemisphere interact with atmospheric rivers. They found when those patterns line up in a certain way, they create a virtual freeway that leads the moisture-laden winds straight to the Sierras. Bin Guan of the Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering, a collaboration between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and UCLA, led a team of scientists from NASA, UCLA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on this research. An atmospheric river is a narrow stream of wind, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) high and sometimes of hurricane strength. Crossing the warm tropical Pacific in a few days, it becomes laden with water vapor. A moderate-sized atmospheric river carries as much water as the Mississippi River dumps into the Gulf of Mexico in an average week. When the river comes ashore and stalls over higher terrain, the water falls as snow or rain. \"Atmospheric rivers are the bridge between climate and West Coast snow,\" said Guan. \"If scientists can predict these atmospheric patterns with reasonable lead times, we'll have a better understanding of water availability and flooding in the region.\" The benefit of improving flood prediction alone would be significant.

    "content": "3 min read By Carol Rasmussen,NASA Earth Science News team Two scientists from NASA and NOAA have developed a new space-based technique for monitoring the ice cover of the Great Lakes that is so accurate it can identify a narrow channel of open water cut through the ice by an icebreaker — even at night. “In the dark, it’s difficult to read a map that’s right in front of you,” said Son Nghiem of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., one of the developers of the new technique. “Yet we now have a way to use satellite radars almost 500 miles [800 kilometers] out in space to see through clouds and darkness and map ice across the Great Lakes.” Ice on the Great Lakes puts a big chill on the U.S. and Canadian economies, affecting shipping, fishing and also public safety when winter and spring flooding are caused by ice jams. It has a significant impact on the regional environment and ecological systems as well. Yet previous techniques of analyzing satellite observations of the ice sometimes misidentified ice as water and vice versa. The new method, co-developed by Nghiem and his colleague George Leshkevich of NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, Ann Arbor, Mich., not only corrects that problem, it also gives a more accurate analysis of ice characteristics, such as whether the ice is dense or full of bubbles, and whether it has melted and refrozen. The method uses a special dictionary that translates binary digital data from satellite radar instruments on the Canadian Space Agency’s RADARSAT-1/2, the European Space Agency’s European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2), and Envisat to identify and map different types of ice over the Great Lakes. The researchers compiled the dictionary by pairing each observed ice type to a library of unique radar signatures that were measured on the lakes using a JPL-developed advanced radar aboard a U.S. Coast Guard icebreaking ship. Leshkevich said the method has now been transitioned to NOAA for routine use in generating ice maps across the Great Lakes. “These maps will provide important information for environmental management, ice forecasting and modeling, off-shore wind farm development, operational icebreaking activities in support of winter navigation, and science research.” The more accurate classification of ice will also be useful for scientific research into such questions as how the Great Lakes are responding to, and leading, climate change in the upper Midwest.

In the United States, the colorless, odorless gas kills about 430 people each year. However, the importance of carbon monoxide (CO) extends well beyond the indoor environment. Indoors or outdoors, the gas can disrupt the transport of oxygen by the blood, leading to heart and health problems. CO also contributes to the formation of tropospheric ozone, another air pollutant with unhealthy effects. And though carbon monoxide does not cause climate change directly, its presence affects the abundance of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Carbon monoxide forms whenever carbon-based fuels—including coal, oil, natural gas and wood—are burned. As a result, many human activities and inventions emit carbon monoxide, including the combustion engines in cars, trucks, planes, ships and other vehicles; the fires lit by farmers to clear forests or fields; and industrial processes that involve the combustion of fossil fuels.

This finding resolves a long-standing debate about a key component of the overall carbon balance of the Amazon basin. The Amazon's carbon balance is a matter of life and death: living trees take carbon dioxide out of the air as they grow, and dead trees put the greenhouse gas back into the air as they decompose. The new study, published in Nature Communications on March 18, is the first to measure tree deaths caused by natural processes throughout the Amazon forest, even in remote areas where no data have been collected at ground level. Fernando Espírito-Santo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., lead author of the study, created new techniques to analyze satellite and other data. He found that each year, dead Amazonian trees emit an estimated 1.9 billion tons (1.7 billion metric tons) of carbon to the atmosphere. To compare this with Amazon carbon absorption, the researchers used censuses of forest growth and different modeling scenarios that accounted for uncertainties. In every scenario, carbon absorption by living trees outweighed emissions from the dead ones, indicating that the prevailing effect in natural forests of the Amazon is absorption. Until now, scientists had only been able to estimate the Amazon's carbon balance from limited observations in small forest areas called plots. On these plots, the forest removes more carbon than it emits, but the scientific community has been vigorously debating how well the plots represent all the natural processes in the huge Amazon region.

    "content": "5 min read Glaciers and ice sheets are commonly thought to work like a belt sander. As they move over the land they scrape off everything — vegetation, soil and even the top layer of bedrock. So a team of university scientists and a NASA colleague were greatly surprised to discover an ancient tundra landscape preserved under the Greenland Ice Sheet, below two miles of ice. \"We found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet for 2.7 million years,\" said University of Vermont geologist and lead author Paul Bierman. The finding provides strong evidence that the Greenland Ice Sheet has persisted much longer than previously known, enduring through many past periods of global warming. The team reported their discovery on April 17 in the journal Science. Greenland is a place of great interest to scientists and policymakers because the future stability of its huge ice sheet — the size of Alaska — will have a fundamental influence on how fast and high global sea levels rise from human-caused climate change. \"The ancient soil under the Greenland ice sheet helps to unravel an important mystery surrounding climate change,\" said Dylan Rood, a co-author on the new study, from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre and the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"How did big ice sheets melt and grow in response to changes in temperature?\" The new discovery indicates that even during the warmest periods since the ice sheet formed, the center of Greenland remained stable. \"It’s likely that it did not fully melt at any time,\" Bierman said. This allowed a tundra landscape to be locked away, unmodified, under ice through millions of years of global warming and cooling. \"Some ice sheet models project that the Greenland Ice Sheet completely melted during previous interglacial periods. These data suggest that did not happen,\" said co-author Tom Neumann, a cryospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"We don’t know how much of the ice sheet remained – to estimate it, we'd have to study other ice cores in Greenland that have sediment in the bottom to see if ancient soil is preserved under those sites as well.\" The scientists tested seventeen samples of \"dirty ice\" – ice with sediment mixed in — from the bottommost 40 feet of the 10,019-foot GISP2 ice core extracted from Summit, Greenland, in",

    "content": "4 min read New NASA research on natural ozone cycles suggests ozone levels in the lowest part of Earth's atmosphere probably won't be affected much by projected future strengthening of the circulating winds that transport ozone between Earth's two lowest atmospheric layers. The finding is good news, since human and plant health are harmed by exposure to ozone near the ground. Significant increases in ozone in Earth's lowest atmospheric layer, the troposphere, would also lead to additional climate warming because ozone is a greenhouse gas. The research, which studied the natural ups and downs in ozone in the troposphere and stratosphere, increases our ability to reliably predict future changes in ozone in Earth's troposphere. This information is useful for developing effective air quality and climate policies. Jessica Neu, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and colleagues used NASA satellite observations to show that short-term periodic strengthening and weakening of circulating winds in Earth's stratosphere — the layer right above the troposphere — account for about half of the observed year-to-year changes in the amount of tropospheric ozone in Earth's northern mid-latitudes. Those are the same latitudes where North America, most of Europe and Central Asia are located. In a first-of-its-kind estimate, they calculated that a 40-percent change in the strength of stratospheric winds increases tropospheric ozone levels by an average of about two percent over Earth's northern mid-latitudes at an altitude of about 16,000 feet (5,000 meters). Results are published this month in the journal Nature Geoscience. While a two-percent change in ozone is small, it does represent a significant natural variation in tropospheric ozone, which has large seasonal changes but only varies by about four percent from year to year at these altitudes in Earth's northern mid-latitudes. As the human contribution to ozone levels evolves due to increased development and stricter air quality controls, the relative importance of natural sources of tropospheric ozone such as the stratosphere will also shift. Global climate models project the stratospheric circulating winds of particular interest to Neu and colleagues are expected to strengthen by about 30 percent over the coming century in response to increased greenhouse gas emissions, but the impacts on tropospheric ozone had been highly uncertain. \"If the correlations between tropospheric ozone and changing stratospheric circulation found in this study hold true in the future, the small changes in tropospheric ozone we measured show it's unlikely the projected long-term changes in stratospheric winds will have a big impact on long-term changes in tropospheric ozone in the future,\" said Neu. The researchers studied changes in the well-established global wind circulation of the stratosphere. Like water in a fountain, winds in the tropics rise up, move toward Earth's poles, and then descend over middle and high latitudes. In these regions, the descending air carries ozone-rich air from the stratosphere to the troposphere. To quantify how ozone responds to changes in wind circulation, Neu and colleagues investigated two natural phenomena known to contribute to shorter-term circulation changes: the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. The study focused on the northern mid-latitudes because that is where most stratospheric ozone enters the troposphere. The researchers used water vapor measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA's Aura satellite from",

Images of data taken by the nation’s newest Earth-observing satellite tracked aerosols from the fires taking six days to reach America's shores. Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite’s Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) tracks aerosols, like this smoke, that are transported by winds across the globe. The Voice of Russia reported that 11,000 hectares (about 42.4 square miles) of forests in Siberia were on fire in May and that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations says roughly 80 percent of these fires are intentionally set to clear land for farming. Colin Seftor, an atmospheric physicist working for Science Systems and Applications, Inc. at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md. studies aerosols using OMPS data and created images from them. \"This smoke event is one example that shows that what happens over one area of the earth can easily affect another area thousands of miles away, whether it’s from Asia to North America or North America to Europe, and so on. Not only smoke and dust can get carried long distance. Pollutants, and even disease-carrying spores can be carried by the prevailing winds. For this event, I found out that the smoke plumes were lofted up to at least 12 kilometers (or about 7.5 miles) from the intense heat of the fires. At that point the smoke got picked up by higher level winds,\" Seftor says. Seftor false-colored the images to make the data stand out. He said,\" The colors on the image are artificial, but what they convey is a sense of the density of the smoke.\" In the images, he used blue and green colors to represent less smoke. Yellows and pink represent more smoke. Seftor showed smoke density by the level of transparency in the coloration. The less dense the smoke is the more you can see through it, and the more dense it is, the less you can see through it. The thickest area of smoke appears over Mongolia. This high concentration is transported across the Pacific Ocean and crosses into Alaska. Fires burning in Siberia recently sent smoke across the Pacific Ocean and into the U.S. and Canada.

Larger image Seftor says that unlike photographs, satellite data shows researchers the difference between reflections of smoke and dust from those from snow, ice or the tops of clouds. The UV (ultra-violet) aerosol index is helpful because it makes \"seeing\" dust and smoke easier even when that background is bright. The aerosol index allows him to separate the aerosol signal from the background. \"One of the biggest uncertainties we’ve had in terms of understanding our climate has to do with aerosols and what exactly aerosols do to the climate,\" Seftor says, adding that the OMPS instrument adds to and expands on decades of scientific research. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was the precursor to OMPS. \"Climate changes often occur over long periods, and it takes decades of data and measurements to detect and understand them. \" The JPSS program, funded by NOAA, provides the ground segment for Suomi NPP. NOAA and the Department of Defense funded the OMPS instrument. Seftor uses MODIS RGB imagery from the National Earth Observations website.

Plans call for cruising over the Pacific Ocean, forests in Northern California, the Oregon coast and cornfields in Indiana. Flights should wrap up around the end of August. NASA Langley, along with the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are all honing new carbon dioxide measurement techniques and technologies under a mission called ASCENDS, which stands for Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons. The systems use lasers to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the air between the instrument and Earth’s surface. Existing satellites use reflected sunlight to gauge carbon dioxide, so they only work in daylight conditions. Carbon dioxide is considered an important contributor to global warming, so NASA wants to make more measurements under a wider set of conditions. Langley’s team will measure carbon dioxide using a tool called the Multi-functional Fiber Laser Lidar, or MFLL. Developed by Indiana-based Exelis Inc.

Saudi Arabia reaches these underground rivers and lakes by drilling through the desert floor, directly irrigating the fields with a circular sprinkler system. This technique is called center-pivot irrigation. Because rainfall in this area is now only a few centimeters (about one inch) each year, water here is a non-renewable resource. Although no one knows how much water is beneath the desert, hydrologists estimate it will only be economical to pump water for about 50 years.

Download video Download still Warm ocean currents attacking the underside of ice shelves are the dominant cause of recent ice loss from Antarctica, a new study using measurements from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) revealed. An international team of scientists used a combination of satellite measurements and models to differentiate between the two known causes of melting ice shelves: warm ocean currents thawing the underbelly of the floating extensions of ice sheets and warm air melting them from above. The finding, published today in the journal Nature, brings scientists a step closer to providing reliable projections of future sea level rise. The researchers concluded that 20 of the 54 ice shelves studied are being melted by warm ocean currents. Most of these are in West Antarctica, where inland glaciers flowing down to the coast and feeding into these thinning ice shelves have accelerated, draining more ice into the sea and contributing to sea-level rise. This ocean-driven thinning is responsible for the most widespread and rapid ice losses in West Antarctica, and for the majority of Antarctic ice sheet loss during the study period. \"We can lose an awful lot of ice to the sea without ever having summers warm enough to make the snow on top of the glaciers melt,\" said the study's lead author Hamish Pritchard of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, United Kingdom. \"The oceans can do all the work from below.\" To map the changing thickness of almost all the floating ice shelves around Antarctica, the team used a time series of 4.5 million surface height measurements taken by a laser instrument mounted on ICESat from October",

This may provide more detailed information about the particles in Earth's atmosphere. Credit: NASA The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), a new instrument that will measure the character and worldwide distribution of the tiny particles that make up haze, dust, air pollutants and smoke, will do more than gather data once it’s deployed on the International Space Station this year. “CATS is a groundbreaking science and technology pathfinder,” said Colleen Hartman, deputy center director for science at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Not only will it make critical measurements that will tell us more about the global impact of pollution, smoke and dust on Earth’s climate, it will demonstrate promising new technology and prove that inexpensive missions can make critical measurements needed by the modelers to predict future climate changes.” A technological first Technologically, NASA has never before flown an instrument like CATS. Developed by a Goddard team led by scientist Matt McGill, the refrigerator-size CATS will demonstrate for the first time three-wavelength laser technology for measuring volcanic particles and other aerosols from space. It is intended to operate for at least six months and up to three years aboard the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility, augmenting measurements gathered by NASA’s CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) mission. However, the big difference between the two is that CALIPSO uses two wavelengths — the 1,064- and 532-nanometer wavelengths — to study the same phenomena. That’s not the only difference, McGill said. CATS, which was developed with NASA and Goddard research and development funding, also carries extremely sensitive detectors that can count individual photons, delivering better resolution and finer-scale details. It also will fire 5,000 laser pulses per second, using only one millijoule of energy per second. In sharp contrast, CALIPSO delivers 20 laser pulses per second, using a whopping 110 millijoules of energy in each of those pulses. “As a pathfinder mission, what we’re trying to determine is whether the addition of the third wavelength — 355 nanometers, which is in the ultraviolet — will produce the results we expect it to generate,” McGill said. “We believe it will deliver more detailed information revealing whether the particles scientists see in the atmosphere are dust, smoke or pollution.” Though it adds an advanced capability, particularly when coupled with the new detectors, engineers believe the ultraviolet wavelength may be particularly susceptible to damage caused by contamination, McGill said. “If you get contamination on any of your outgoing optics, they can self-destruct, and then your system’s dead,” he said. “You end up with very limited lifetime. The way to find out is to fly a relatively inexpensive payload aboard an existing platform, like the International Space Station.” As it turns out, the space station is a very useful berth for gathering aerosol measurements, McGill said. The station travels in a precessing orbit — it shifts around and around, traveling from 51 degrees north latitude to 51 degrees south latitude. As a result, CATS will provide good coverage of what’s happening over most population centers. “In addition, the station passes over and along many of the primary aerosol-transport paths within Earth’s atmosphere,” McGill added. One of Earth’s primary transport routes for airborne pollutants is from Southeast Asia. Circulation cells in Earth’s atmosphere transport particles over Japan, northward south of Alaska, and then south toward the West Coast of the United States, making a big, inverted “U” shape. Another atmospheric circulation cell moves aerosols from western Canada eastward and then southward, over the Great Lakes and the East Coast. “Because smoke-darkened skies over cities and communities can pose health risks to populations, especially to the medically vulnerable, the ability to track those aerosols and deliver warnings is critical,” McGill said. Long-term data also can reveal the shifts that are occurring in global climate — whether changes are occurring in cloud cover or whether the level of pollutants is increasing or decreasing — over geographic distances and time. The future of technology demos “What excites us so much about CATS is the fact that it will add to the observations of the aging CALIPSO,” Hartman said. “It also will show that inexpensive missions, like CATS, can be installed on the space station, pointing nadir, to make critical measurements over months at a time. Think of all the Earth-observing science that might be done in a cost-effective manner from the International Space Station.” McGill agreed. “In our current budget-constrained environment, we need to use what we already have, such as the space station, to do more with less,” McGill said, adding that if the instrument works, it can be scaled up to be a free-flier mission. “One of the most exciting things for me has been the opportunity to develop a small, low-cost, quick-turnaround payload for the International Space Station, a pathfinder project representing what’s possible for future technology investigations,” he said. “We did this using a small team, a streamlined process, and a build-to-cost mentality — and we proved it can be done.” This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "5 min read A laser-based instrument being developed for the International Space Station will provide a unique 3D view of Earth’s forests, helping to fill in missing information about their role in the carbon cycle. Called the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar, the instrument will be the first to systematically probe the depths of the forests from space. The system is one of two instrument proposals recently selected for NASA’s Earth Venture Instrument program and is being led by the University of Maryland, College Park. The instrument will be built at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “As a global leader in research and discovery related to environmental sustainability, the University of Maryland is extraordinarily proud to be a part of this new venture with our partners from NASA,” said University of Maryland Vice President and Chief Research Officer Patrick O'Shea. “GEDI lidar will have a tremendous impact on our ability to monitor forest degradation, adding to the critical data needed to mitigate the effects of climate change.” “GEDI will be a tremendous new resource for studying Earth’s vegetation,” said Piers Sellers, deputy director of Goddard’s Sciences and Exploration Directorate. “In particular, the GEDI data will provide us with global-scale insights into how much carbon is being stored in the forest biomass. This information will be particularly powerful when combined with the historical record of changes captured by the U.S.’s long-standing program of Earth-orbiting satellites, such as Landsat and MODIS.” The MODIS, or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, is an instrument that flies aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. By revealing the 3D architecture of forests in unprecedented detail, GEDI will provide crucial information about the impact that trees have on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Although it is well-established that trees absorb carbon and store it long-term, scientists have not quantified exactly how much carbon forests contain. As a result, it’s not possible to determine how much carbon would be released if a forest were destroyed, nor how well emissions could be countered by planting new trees. \"One of the most poorly quantified components of the carbon cycle is the net balance between forest disturbance and regrowth,” said Ralph Dubayah, the GEDI principal investigator at the University of Maryland. “GEDI will help scientists fill in this missing piece by revealing the vertical structure of the forest, which is information we really can’t get with sufficient accuracy any other way.” GEDI can do this because it’s a laser-based system, called a lidar, that can measure the distance from the space-based instrument to Earth’s surface with enough accuracy to detect subtle variations, including the tops of trees, the ground, and the vertical distribution of aboveground biomass in forests. Its immediate predecessors are Goddard’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and airborne Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor, known as LVIS, which is flown on high-altitude aircraft to measure forests, land topography, ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice. “Lidar has the unique ability to peer into the tree canopy to precisely measure the height and internal structure of the forest at the fine scale required to accurately estimate their carbon content,” said Bryan Blair, the deputy principal investigator for GEDI at Goddard. GEDI will carry a trio of specialized lasers, developed in-house at Goddard, and will use sophisticated optics to divide the three beams out into 14 tracks on the ground. Together, these tracks will be spaced 1,640 feet (500 meters) apart on the surface creating a total swath width of about 4 miles (6.5 kilometers). GEDI will sample all of the land between 50 degrees north latitude and 50 degrees south latitude this way, covering nearly all tropical and temperate forests. The lasers will illuminate the surface with brief pulses of light that are optimized to pass through the canopy of even very dense forests without causing harm. (The lasers are eye-safe.) The team estimates that the instrument will send out 16 billion pulses in one year. A small fraction of each pulse – the return pulse – is reflected back to a detector on the orbiting instrument. The amount of time it takes to complete this round trip is measured precisely and converted into a distance. In addition, the materials that a pulse encounters along the way will modify the signal slightly, resulting in a different fingerprint or vertical profile when a pulse interacts with leafy tree tops versus woody branches and trunks or the ground. These fingerprints will provide enough detail to measure the height of the trees and where the tree canopy begins with an accuracy of about 3-1/3 feet (1 meter). From this information, scientists will be able to estimate how much biomass the trees contain and, in turn, how much carbon they are storing. By combining these findings with spatially comprehensive maps from other satellites showing where development and deforestation are taking place, or with studies that reveal the composition of forests, scientists will have a more powerful tool set for addressing questions about land use, habitat diversity and climate effects. For example, researchers will be able to relate forest architecture with habitat quality and the biodiversity of certain birds. They also may be able to estimate the age of trees in specific forests. The ultimate goal, Dubayah said, is to be able to monitor these and other changes in forests over time. GEDI is scheduled to be completed in",

Previously, Yuen managed the mission’s education and public outreach activities. Over the last 60 years or so, we have discovered that only about half of the carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere stays in the atmosphere. Where is the other half going? Is it being absorbed by the oceans or vegetation on land? The answer is critical if we’re to fully understand the future climate change in store for us and the impact of our emissions. The flight of OCO-2 will unveil new answers. I like to be challenged all the time. I need to learn new things and have the chance to become better.

But these worlds could come crashing down as a result of ocean acidification, a problem that has only relatively recently come to light. Ocean acidification describes the process by which our ocean has become more acidic — about 30 percent more — since the Industrial Revolution. About a quarter of the carbon dioxide (CO2) we pump out into the atmosphere every day through the burning of fossil fuels and other activities is absorbed by the seas. Sigourney Weaver, who narrates the video, asks, “What happens when so much CO2 — 22 million tons of it each day — mixes with ocean water?” Scientists once thought this ‘mopping up’ process was beneficial because it reduces the amount of CO2 in the air that can cause global warming. But we now know that the uptake of CO2 can in fact alter ocean chemistry for thousands of years, and damage marine life in the process. Ocean acidification interferes with the process of calcification, by which marine animals such as mollusks and crustaceans make cell coverings or skeletons from calcium carbonate. It has been implicated in causing coral reefs to lose their color (an effect known as “coral bleaching”). And more acidic seas can also affect phytoplankton and zooplankton, which are major food sources for fish and other sea creatures. All in all, a more acidic ocean could wipe out species, disrupt the food chain and hurt fisheries, tourism and other ocean-dependent industries.

Launches are big and showy; they get our attention, but it’s the stuff that happens after the launch that’s really interesting. So now that GPM is safely in space orbiting Earth, we’ll look forward to getting our hands on the data and sharing it with you. While we were building and launching the actual GPM satellite, we were also building a virtual satellite to launch into cyberspace, and we made it as realistic as possible. So, while NASA's engineers control and drive the spacecraft, and scientists look closely at the data and use it to learn more about precipitation patterns around the world, people like you also get a chance to follow the spacecraft on NASA’s popular Eyes on the Earth 3D interactive portal. Every virtual NASA satellite is a high-end photorealistic rendering created by a 3D art director. They all have accurate telemetry, which means you can view the satellites as they orbit Earth, zoom in and look at them closely, or access real time data from your keyboard. Last week I sat down with Kevin Hussey, the guy who came up with the notion of being able to fly next to a satellite because he “thought it would be exceptionally cool.\" When I asked if he saw himself as a cowboy with the satellite as his bronco, he got all giddy with laughter. But he would admit only to “being an armchair astronaut,” even though I still think he secretly wants to ride one. He steered the conversation back to reality, explaining that as the visualization technology improves, we give people a very realistic feel for what it looks like being in space with the Earth satellites, which have a beautiful vantage point. \"Each one has a different personality. They have different color foils on [their] instruments. Some emit energy and record reflection. Some are static, and some are dynamic. GPM has a spinning antenna.\" Although the satellites have fixed orbits, he said, \"they may be moved or their orbits may degrade. So, to be accurate about the location, we correct the orbits every day, or several times a day.\" For Suzy user at home, there’s definitely the \"cool\" factor, Kevin said. You can track GPM and see it flying from your desktop today on Eyes on the Earth 3D. Then after the \"science team has a chance to verify the accuracy and validate the GPM data, [the visualization team will] work together [with the scientists] to agree upon a color scale and display the data\" for you to look at as well.

    "content": "By Rosemary Sullivant NASA Global Climate Change Excess carbon absorbed by the ocean threatens to turn coral reefs, one of the most diverse and important ecosystems on Earth, into ghostly bleached wastelands. Good news has turned out to be bad. The ocean has helped slow global warming by absorbing much of the excess heat and heat-trapping carbon dioxide that has been going into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution. All that extra carbon dioxide, however, has been a bitter pill for the ocean to swallow. It's changing the chemistry of seawater, making it more acidic and otherwise inhospitable, threatening many important marine organisms. Scientists call ocean acidification \"the other CO2 problem.\" They warn that because it causes such fundamental changes in the ocean, it could impact millions of people who depend on the ocean for food and resources. \"The growing amount of carbon dioxide in the ocean could have a bigger effect on life on Earth than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" says JPL's Charles Miller, deputy principal investigator for NASA's new Orbiting Carbon Observatory, scheduled to launch next January. The ocean takes in and stores most of the heat from the sun that is deposited at Earth's surface--heat that would otherwise be melting land ice and warming the atmosphere. The ocean also absorbs about one third of the carbon dioxide that humans now put into the air. The rest is taken up by terrestrial vegetation and soils or remains in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect. \"The ocean surface acts like a sponge to soak up excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,\" says Scott Doney, a senior scientist in marine chemistry at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass. Much of the extra dissolved carbon is in the ocean's upper few thousand feet. However, at high latitudes, surface water quickly cools, becomes saltier and denser and sinks, carrying the dissolved carbon to some of the deepest parts of the ocean. Mix carbon dioxide with water and the result is carbonic acid. After that first simple chemical reaction comes a slightly more complicated series of changes in seawater chemistry. The final outcome is a lowering of the ocean's pH--meaning the ocean is more acidic, and, ironically, a reduction in a particular form of carbon--carbonate ion--that many marine organisms need to make shells and skeletal material. The lower pH and lack of carbonate ion have serious consequences for life in the ocean. MODIS images showing a plankton bloom off Norway. Closest to the atmospheric source of excess carbon dioxide, the ocean's surface waters are the first to show the effects of acidification. Since the beginning of the industrial era, the pH of surface waters has decreased slightly but significantly from 8.2 to 8.1, and it continues to decrease. Scientists project the pH of surface water will decrease by the year",

The new result shows that the changes in this part of the Arctic have not yet had enough impact to affect the global methane budget. This is important because methane is the third most common greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, after water vapor and carbon dioxide. Although there is much less of it in the air, it is 33 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and adding to greenhouse warming. High concentrations of atmospheric methane have been measured at individual Arctic sites, especially in Siberia. This adds to the concern that massive methane releases are already occurring in the far North.

These shifts are governed, like much of the climate on the planet, by the relationship between winds and ocean surface temperatures. When trade winds, blowing from east to west across the Pacific, are strong, equatorial waters are very cool, signaling the arrival of La Niña. When these winds falter, ocean surface temperatures rise and signal the arrival of the warm sibling, El Niño (\"Christ Child\" in Spanish). These warm and cool pools expand and linger across much of the tropics for many months, causing dramatic shifts in worldwide temperature and rainfall patterns over both the oceans and continents. These shifts happen every five to seven years and have been around for centuries. 2.

By Amber Jenkins, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Scientists have come up with an entirely new way to monitor the health of Earth’s plants from space. In work published in Geophysical Research Letters [1], researchers working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and in Germany and Japan report on how measurements taken from space can open a whole new window onto the planet’s carbon cycle. Carbon is a building block of life. It is also a key component of our climate. Carbon dioxide — a gas that exists naturally in the air, but is also produced by humans when we burn fossil fuels, drive cars and chop down trees — acts as a thermostat that controls the temperature of the planet. As a “greenhouse gas,” it acts like a blanket that traps heat close to the surface of the Earth. The more carbon dioxide we emit, the more the warming. Since the beginning of the industrial age, carbon dioxide levels have gone up by nearly 40 percent, and the world’s average temperature has risen by about 0.5 degrees Celsius (nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit) as a result. Knowing how much carbon is going into and out of the Earth’s land, air and oceans — the carbon cycle — is critical for understanding how much global warming is likely to happen to our planet in the future. And plants and vegetation are a key part of this cycle. When plants photosynthesize, they use energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide from the air into sugars used to live and grow. In doing so, they give off a fluorescent light — a glow that can’t be seen with the naked eye, but that can be seen with the right instruments. More photosynthesis translates into more fluorescence, meaning that the plants are very productive in taking up carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon dioxide taken up by plants is called “gross primary productivity,” and is the largest part of the global carbon cycle. Launched in",

The map, which shows glaciers flowing thousands of miles from the continent's deep interior to its coast, will be critical for tracking future sea-level increases from climate change. The team created the map using integrated radar observations from a consortium of international satellites. \"This is like seeing a map of all the oceans' currents for the first time. It's a game changer for glaciology,\" said Eric Rignot of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the University of California (UC), Irvine. Rignot is lead author of a paper about the ice flow published online Thursday in Science Express. \"We are seeing amazing flows from the heart of the continent that had never been described before.\" Rignot and UC Irvine scientists Jeremie Mouginot and Bernd Scheuchl used billions of data points captured by European, Japanese and Canadian satellites to weed out cloud cover, solar glare and land features masking the glaciers. With the aid of NASA technology, the team painstakingly pieced together the shape and velocity of glacial formations, including the previously uncharted East Antarctica, which comprises 77 percent of the continent. Like viewers of a completed jigsaw puzzle, the scientists were surprised when they stood back and took in the full picture. They discovered a new ridge splitting the 5.4 million-square-mile (14 million-square-kilometer) landmass from east to west. The team also found unnamed formations moving up to 800 feet (244 meters) annually across immense plains sloping toward the Antarctic Ocean and in a different manner than past models of ice migration. \"The map points out something fundamentally new: that ice moves by slipping along the ground it rests on,\" said Thomas Wagner, NASA's cryospheric program scientist in Washington. \"That's critical knowledge for predicting future sea level rise.

    "content": "5 min read As the world's population grows and the climate changes, food production will have to increase 70 percent within 35-40 years to meet global food needs, according to a recent U.N. estimate. Today, yields of major crops are increasing slowly at best; some are even declining. Cross-breeding effective new varieties in the field can take years or even decades. To keep feeding the world, we need new ways forward. Darren Drewry has found one path. The scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., has been studying soybeans, the world's most important protein crop, to discover how different characteristics of the plant — the arrangement of leaves up and down the stem, for example — affect crop yields, water use, and the amount of light that the crop reflects back to space. Using an advanced vegetation model and high-performance computer optimization techniques, Drewry has designed a soybean plant that can produce more beans while requiring less water and helping to offset greenhouse gas-warming. His results were published April 3 in the journal Global Change Biology. The study was funded by the National Science Foundation with support from JPL and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Drewry and his coauthors (Praveen Kumar and Stephen Long, both of the University of Illinois) are the first to demonstrate that a major food crop can be modified to meet multiple goals at the same time. \"My intuition would have told me that some of these goals are mutually exclusive — that there is a fundamental tradeoff between increasing productivity and conserving water, for example,\" said Drewry. \"We are now able to say that there actually is a combination of traits that will make progress toward all of these goals simultaneously.\" Drewry developed the model that he used for this study (called MLCan, for multi-layer canopy model) to study U.S. Midwest agricultural systems, but it can be modified for research on other types of vegetation. It captures exchanges of carbon dioxide, water and energy between vegetation and the atmosphere in great detail. The study used numerical optimization, a mathematical way to decide which choice among a range of options will create the closest match to a desired outcome. Drewry chose five structural characteristics of a plant, such as the total leaf area (how many/large the leaves are) and the angle at which leaves are set on the plant stems. The MLCan model varied one or a combination of the five traits for each experiment, discarding less successful solutions and refining those that made progress toward the goals. Depending on which goals they are intended to meet, redesigned soybean plants can differ significantly. For example, one variety developed in the new study required 13 percent less irrigation water but was just as productive as current varieties, which would be valuable for farmers in drought-stricken areas. This plant had fewer leaves overall, and more of the leaves were located toward the bottom of the plant than is common among current varieties, which often have dense foliage at the canopy top. That arrangement was an evolutionary advantage in the wild, where the shady canopy might keep plants from growing nearby and taking moisture and nutrients away from the soybean. In a modern farm, the dense top leaves get far more sunlight than they can use for photosynthesis and lower leaves don’t get enough. \"Fixing that problem alone can produce significant gains in productivity,\" Drewry said. Another redesigned soybean reflected 34 percent more light back to space without a loss of crop yield. To reach that result, several traits had to be altered at the same time, including how much light leaves reflect in specific regions of the solar spectrum, the angle of the leaves and the distribution and density of foliage. The modeling study quickly found answers that would have required decades of cross-breeding in the field, according to Drewry. Plant hybridizers address one trait at a time, and creating a new prototype typically takes several generations — with no guarantee that the trait in question is the most critical one for meeting the hybridizer's goal. \"Looking at two or three traits at once is too complex, and the length of time it would take to implement the changes in the field is prohibitive,\" Drewry said. Now that the desired traits are known, a commercial hybridizer could find the seeds or genetic material needed to grow plants with these traits in a repository such as the USDA's Soybean Germplasm Collection, which contains about 20,000 soybean varieties from around the world. Compared to many of the so-called geoengineering solutions that have been suggested for climate change, such as spraying sulfates into the upper atmosphere to reduce incoming sunlight or loading the ocean with iron to increase plankton photosynthesis, modifying annual crop covers is inexpensive, can be implemented quickly and is reversible. \"Many proposed geoengineering solutions require significant resources, and we don't know all of the potential downstream effects,\" Drewry said. \"If changing an annual crop has an unforeseen consequence, we can simply return to the variety we grew the previous year.\" Some career changes involve small shifts.

The paired satellites travel about 137 miles (220 kilometers) apart and record small changes in the distance separating them as they encounter variations in Earth's gravitational field.

    "content": "Using satellite imagery, scientists have come up with a clever way to map agricultural water consumption. The technique may ultimately help us to better manage our precious water resources. Planet Earth should really be called “Planet Ocean”, because 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water. Of the 326 million cubic miles of water that make up the world’s total water supply, around 97 percent of it is saline. The remaining 3 percent is freshwater – the stuff we drink, bathe in, water our crops with, and use in manufacturing and industry. Freshwater scarcity is becoming an increasing concern, with some arguing that it will become one of the world’s most important issues this century, exacerbated as it will be by population growth and harsher droughts arising from climate change. Agriculture is a major cog in the water wheel: worldwide, 70 percent of all the water withdrawn for human use is devoted to land irrigation. It’s also responsible for a lot of wastage: according to the International Water Management Institute, while it currently takes 1,000 to 2,000 liters of water to produce a kilogram of grain, the same could be done with as little as 500 liters. Using satellite imagery, scientists have come up with a clever way to map agricultural water consumption, which may ultimately help us to get more crop per drop. In a new video released by NASA (below), water specialists Rick Allen, Bill Kramber and Tony Morse describe their “Mapping Evapotranspiration” technique, which, using spaceborne instruments, tracks the amount of heat in fields and reveals clues about water use in that area. Evapotranspiration is an important part of the water cycle involving vegetation. It describes the amount of water that evaporates directly from the soil plus the amount of transpiration – the release of water – through plant leaves. Water taken away by evapotranspiration carries heat energy with it, so farm fields consuming more water appear cooler. While these soil temperature differences are invisible to the eye, they can be picked up by infrared instruments on NASA’s Landsat satellite, and can tell us whether or not there is enough water to supply the needs of the plants. Mapping evapotranspiration offers an objective way for water managers to assess on a field-by-field basis how much water agricultural growers are using. The team’s measurements have even been used to help settle water rights conflicts in court. In recognition of the innovation, Harvard University’s Ash Institute awarded the work a prestigious Innovations in American Government Award. More innovations in water resource management are likely to come from space satellites and the unique vantage point that they offer us.

For starters, they carry water — and lots of it — around the world, driving the Earth’s water cycle. Second, they help to balance the Earth’s \"energy budget” — by either reflecting the sun’s energy back out into space (low clouds) or acting as a “blanket” that traps heat in the atmosphere (high clouds). The 64 million dollar question is this: Just how big an effect can clouds have on the climate? Even small changes in the amount of clouds in the sky could alter the climate as dramatically as anticipated increases in greenhouse gases have been predicted to do. There are also complicated “cloud-climate feedbacks” to contend with: changes in climate that are caused by clouds can, in turn, give rise to further changes in clouds, and so on and so forth. It’s enough to give scientists, who are trying to predict future climate change by developing state-of-the-art climate models (akin to weather forecasts), a serious headache. Engineers in northern Ireland have now come to the rescue. Professor Robert Cahill and colleagues at Queen’s University Belfast have designed a high-performance electronic gadget, known as a “Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) filter”, which can detect heat radiation in the sky up to a very high frequency — regardless of how those heat waves are polarized. Polarization is an important characteristic of many types of waves (light, radio, heat waves, for example) and describes the orientation of the wave oscillations as the waves travel along. Up until now, spaceborne instruments have only been able to pick up heat waves of one particular polarization at a time from gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. The new FSS filter will pave the way towards more complicated cloud imaging that has until now been impossible. Plans are already afoot to integrate the technology into next-generation atmospheric probes that will be launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) next decade.

    "content": "3 min read Scientists at NASA and the University of California, Irvine (UCI), have found that canyons under Greenland's ocean-feeding glaciers are deeper and longer than previously thought, increasing the amount of Greenland's estimated contribution to future sea level rise. \"The glaciers of Greenland are likely to retreat faster and farther inland than anticipated, and for much longer, according to this very different topography we have discovered,” said Mathieu Morlighem, a UCI associate project scientist who is lead author of the new research paper. The results were published Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience. Ice loss from Greenland has accelerated during the last few decades. However, older ice sheet models predicted the speedup would be temporary because the glaciers would soon melt back onto higher ground and stabilize. The models therefore projected Greenland's contribution to global sea level rise would be limited. Morlighem's new topography shows southern Greenland's ragged, crumbling coastline is scored by more than 100 canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean. Many canyons are well below sea level as far as 60 miles (100 kilometers) inland. Higher ground, where glaciers could stabilize, is much farther from the coastline than previously thought. The finding calls into question the idea that the recent accelerated ice loss will be short-lived. Buried under the Greenland Ice Sheet, the subcontinent's bedrock topography has been estimated using soundings from ice-penetrating radar. However, the wet and fractured ice along the southern coastline cluttered the radar soundings so that large swaths of the bed remained invisible. To overcome that problem, Morlighem and his colleagues devised an advanced technique to create a more accurate map. The technique makes the best use of several kinds of data: ice thickness measurements derived from airborne radar; satellite radar interferometry data on the speed and direction of ice movement: and estimates of snowfall and surface melt to the sea. By combining the different types of data, they were able to map the bed topography along Greenland's margins with unprecedented precision and detail. \"We have been able to make a quantum leap in our knowledge of bed topography beneath ice sheets in the last decade, thanks to the advent of missions like NASA's Operation IceBridge in combination with satellite data on the speed these ice sheets are flowing,\" said co-author Eric Rignot of UCI and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.

    "title": "Just 5 questions: Hacking the planet",
    "date": null,
    "content": "By Erik Conway, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory There’s no planet B. But is there a plan B? Can we save ourselves from the worst effects of climate change? Ideas exist, but there’s no magic bullet – hacking the climate may cause more harm than good. We spoke to Riley Duren, a systems engineer based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), to get his take on the topic. Riley looks at how we can use observations of planet Earth to make better-informed responses to climate change. 1. What is geoengineering? Geoengineering is an attempt to avoid or reduce the negative consequences of climate change by directly altering parts of the Earth’s natural system. It’s different from “mitigation” efforts, where people try to reduce emissions of [heat-trapping] greenhouse gases, or preserve natural carbon-dioxide storage or removal mechanisms like forests. It’s also distinct from “adaptation,” which involves dealing with the impacts of climate change. 2. What are some examples of geoengineering? Geoengineering schemes basically fall into two broad camps. The first involves reducing the amount of the sun’s energy reaching the surface of the planet. This could be done by injecting sulfate particles into the upper atmosphere – essentially mimicking a large volcanic eruption and the cooling that follows. Or injecting sea salt into the lower atmosphere to seed or brighten clouds so that they reflect incoming sunlight away from the planet. Another option might be to increase the reflectivity of large areas of the Earth’s surface by changing the mix of plants and vegetation. The second main approach involves removing (or boosting the removal of) carbon from the atmosphere – essentially “negative emissions.” This might be achieved by stimulating ecosystems to “mop up” carbon or building large machines to absorb carbon dioxide and store it underground. In addition to slowing the rise in Earth’s temperature, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide accumulating in the air would help keep it from mixing in the oceans, where it makes the waters more acidic and can have catastrophic impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Scientists are already seeing this acidification happen today. 3. What would geoengineering solve, and what would it not solve? Geoengineering is not a cure. At best, it’s a Band-Aid or tourniquet; at worst, it could be a self-inflicted wound. By itself, hacking the climate system won’t fix the way society manages the planet, and in fact it can de-incentivize [effective management]. If geoengineering is perceived as a “silver bullet” that offers the illusion of consequence-free carbon pollution, then there’s no incentive to control emissions that are the root cause of the problem. Even if geoengineering could be made to work safely, we would have to continuously ramp it up to keep pace with accelerating emissions – and that’s not sustainable. The climate has a lot of inertia; once it starts moving in a certain direction it may be difficult to stop. The carbon we are pumping into the atmosphere today is essentially permanent; natural processes take thousands of years to remove it. There may also be irreversible “tipping points” – cliffs, or points of no return – that could cause dramatic, abrupt climate changes like shifts in ocean circulation or irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Generally, we don’t understand the risks of geoengineering well. Engineering the planet could make things worse, and it could cause serious social and political issues. All of these things suggest to me that geoengineering should be seen as a highly uncertain insurance policy or emergency response, not a solution. By itself, hacking the climate system won’t fix the way society manages the planet, and in fact it can de-incentivize [effective management]. 4. How is JPL involved in geoengineering? We’re focused on improving our understanding of how the Earth system works, not on doing actual geoengineering. Other groups are addressing questions like: What’s the most efficient way to do cloud seeding? How could you inject aerosols into the stratosphere? At JPL, we’re interested in working out how key climate processes are connected and how we can use satellite observations to provide policymakers with better information they can use to make objective decisions about geoengineering. Equally important, we want to identify where limits in observations and scientific understanding preclude reliable assessments of the impact of geoengineering. Understanding the uncertainty is essential. 5. How are you working to inform decision-makers? By offering them (and the public) better data about the Earth and how it responds to human actions, so that they can objectively weigh the pros and cons of geoengineering. In an ideal world, decisions about geoengineering would be done in a thoughtful way, drawing on research that quantifies outcomes and risks – including the possible unintended consequences of a particular geoengineering scheme. Geoengineering would only happen when all the governments got together and agreed on a course of action well in advance of a perceived threat. But we don’t live in an ideal world. A risk with some forms of geoengineering is that even the smallest countries or private entities with relatively modest resources could undertake global-scale climate manipulation. A country could decide to inject aerosols into the stratosphere over their airspace or seed clouds over the ocean, and that could have worldwide consequences. So it seems prudent to use scientifically robust, transparent research to improve our understanding of how the Earth might respond to geoengineering. Even though we’re not making recommendations on geoengineering, we’re helping shape assessments of the effects, risks and uncertainties. I think that’s an important contribution to the overall public dialogue on this complex topic.

Aerosols scatter and absorb incoming sunlight and affect the formation and properties of clouds. Among all cloud types, low-level clouds over the ocean, which cover about one-third of the ocean’s surface, have the biggest impact on the albedo, or reflectivity, of Earth’s surface, reflecting solar energy back to space and cooling our planet. Now a new, comprehensive global analysis of satellite data led by Yi-Chun Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and a joint team of researchers from JPL and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, has quantified how changes in aerosol levels affect these warm clouds over the ocean. The findings appeared Aug. 3 in the advance online version of the journal Nature Geoscience. Changes in aerosol levels have two main effects — they alter the amount of clouds in the atmosphere and change their properties. Water vapor condenses on aerosol particles into cloud droplets or cloud ice particles, so higher levels of aerosols mean more clouds. With regard to cloud properties, increased aerosol levels can either increase or decrease the amount of liquid water in clouds, depending on whether the clouds are raining or not, the stability of the atmosphere and humidity levels in the upper troposphere.

Rignot said these findings will require an upward revision to current predictions of sea level rise. \"This sector will be a major contributor to sea level rise in the decades and centuries to come,\" Rignot said. \"A conservative estimate is it could take several centuries for all of the ice to flow into the sea.\" Three major lines of evidence point to the glaciers' eventual demise: the changes in their flow speeds, how much of each glacier floats on seawater, and the slope of the terrain they are flowing over and its depth below sea level. In a paper in April, Rignot's research group discussed the steadily increasing flow speeds of these glaciers over the past 40 years. This new study examines the other two lines of evidence. The glaciers flow out from land to the ocean, with their leading edges afloat on the seawater. The point on a glacier where it first loses contact with land is called the grounding line. Nearly all glacier melt occurs on the underside of the glacier beyond the grounding line, on the section floating on seawater. Just as a grounded boat can float again on shallow water if it is made lighter, a glacier can float over an area where it used to be grounded if it becomes lighter, which it does by melting or by the thinning effects of the glacier stretching out. The Antarctic glaciers studied by Rignot's group have thinned so much they are now floating above places where they used to sit solidly on land, which means their grounding lines are retreating inland. \"The grounding line is buried under a thousand or more meters of ice, so it is incredibly challenging for a human observer on the ice sheet surface to figure out exactly where the transition is,\" Rignot said. \"This analysis is best done using satellite techniques.\" The team used radar observations captured between",

A new NASA field campaign will begin flights over the Arctic this summer to study the effect of sea ice retreat on Arctic climate. The Arctic Radiation IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment (ARISE) will conduct research flights Aug. 28 through Oct. 1, covering the peak of summer sea ice melt. ARISE is NASA's first Arctic airborne campaign designed to take simultaneous measurements of ice, clouds and the levels of incoming and outgoing radiation, the balance of which determines the degree of climate warming. The campaign team will fly aboard NASA’s C-130 aircraft from Thule Air Base in northern Greenland the first week and from Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, Alaska, through the remainder of the campaign. In recent years the Arctic has experienced increased summer sea ice loss. Scientists expect the exposure of more open water to sunlight could enhance warming in the region and cause the release of more moisture to the atmosphere. Additional moisture could affect cloud formation and the exchange of heat from Earth’s surface to space. Researchers are grappling with how these changes in the Arctic affect global climate. \"A wild card in what's happening in the Arctic is clouds and how changes in clouds, due to changing sea-ice conditions, enhance or offset warming,\" said Bill Smith, ARISE principal investigator at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. ARISE was planned over the last year to take advantage of NASA’s existing capabilities for gathering data about ongoing changes in the Arctic. Satellites provided some information about clouds and the energy balance in the Arctic, but the multiple instruments flown during ARISE should provide further insight. \"The clouds and surface conditions over the Arctic as we observe them from satellites are very complex,\" Smith said. \"We need more information to understand how to better interpret the satellite measurements, and an aircraft can help with that.\" The array of instruments on ARISE should help scientists better observe how sea ice loss is affecting Arctic cloud formation and therefore the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation. Low-level clouds typically reflect more sunlight and offset warming, while higher clouds are typically less reflective and act to trap more heat in the atmosphere. “It’s a complex business, but it depends on a lot of things we can, in fact, measure,” said Hal Maring, program manager for radiation sciences in the Earth Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. ARISE researchers will fly survey missions that target different cloud types and surface conditions, such as open water, land ice and sea ice. The missions will be timed to fly under the orbit paths of key satellite instruments, such as the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) instruments on multiple NASA satellites. Each morning, mission planners will look at satellite timings and weather forecasts to design flight plans that meet the most objectives of the campaign. The NASA C-130, based at the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, will carry instruments that measure solar (incoming) and infrared (outgoing) radiation, ice surface elevation and cloud properties such as cloud particle size. This will be the first time that many of these instruments, including the mission's laser altimeter, have flown together. The ARISE campaign is a joint effort of the Radiation Sciences, Cryospheric Sciences and Airborne Sciences programs of the Earth Science Division in NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic, and a new NASA mission… It’s not just rising air and water temperatures influencing the decades-long decline of Arctic sea… Editor’s note, April 16,",

This discovery of life existing in one of Earth's darkest, saltiest and coldest habitats is significant because it helps increase our limited knowledge of how life can sustain itself in these extreme environments on our own planet and beyond. Lake Vida, the largest of several unique lakes found in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, contains no oxygen, is mostly frozen and possesses the highest nitrous oxide levels of any natural water body on Earth. A briny liquid, which is approximately six times saltier than seawater, percolates throughout the icy environment, where the average temperature is minus 8 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 22 degrees Celsius). The international team of scientists published their findings online Nov. 26 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Early Edition. \"This study provides a window into one of the most unique ecosystems on Earth,\" said Alison Murray, a molecular microbial ecologist and polar researcher at the DRI and the report's lead author. \"Our knowledge of geochemical and microbial processes in lightless icy environments, especially at subzero temperatures, has been mostly unknown up until now. This work expands our understanding of the types of life that can survive in these isolated, cryoecosystems and how different strategies may be used to exist in such challenging environments.\" Despite the very cold, dark and isolated nature of the habitat, the report finds the brine harbors a surprisingly diverse and abundant variety of bacteria that survive without a current source of energy from the sun.

But now, new research using data from NASA's Operation IceBridge shows that snow depth on Arctic sea ice has been decreasing over the past several decades, a trend largely owing to later sea ice freeze-up dates in the Arctic. Arctic sea ice melts during the summer and begins refreezing in the fall. A previous NASA study using satellite data found that the date when Arctic waters begin to freeze has been trending later, and because a large portion of the year's snowfall happens in September and October, more of that snow is falling into the ocean and melting instead of landing on ice. \"You don't have a platform for snow to accumulate on,\" said Melinda Webster, the study's lead author and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington, in Seattle, Washington.

    "content": "4 min read Every day, above our planet, five Earth-observing satellites rush along like trains on the same “track,” flying minutes, and sometimes seconds, behind one another. They carry more than 15 scientific instruments in total, looking at many different aspects of our home planet. Called the Afternoon Constellation, or A-Train, these satellites work as a united, powerful tool for advancing our understanding of Earth’s surface and atmosphere. The train is about to get longer. NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), which launched July 2, will be the A-Train’s sixth member. Its mission is to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that makes up a greater percentage of our atmosphere today than it has in at least 800,000 years. It will produce data that will help scientists analyze data from the other A-Train instruments. In return, other satellites will help validate its vital data. “The A-Train constellation is an ideal measurement system for us,” said Dave Crisp, the leader of the OCO-2 science team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. OCO-2 will fly along the same path as NASA satellites CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) and CloudSat, which monitor minute particles in the atmosphere called aerosols, and clouds, respectively. “We’ve lined up the ground tracks of OCO-2, CALIPSO and CloudSat almost perfectly, and we’re hoping to keep them well aligned for as long as possible during the missions, so we can do the science we want with measurements from all three satellites,” Crisp said. OCO-2 measures carbon dioxide by observing its effect on sunlight. Sunlight is made up of waves of many lengths, or frequencies, some visible and others invisible. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, carbon dioxide and other molecules absorb specific frequencies in the spectrum of light, leaving dark, narrow gaps in the spectrum. The more light that has been absorbed in a certain column of air, the more carbon dioxide is present there. In some cases, this may suggest that Earth's surface beneath that air contains a source of carbon dioxide, like a large industrial city. Less carbon dioxide implies a “sink,” which absorbs carbon dioxide, like a thick forest during the growing season. The OCO-2 spacecraft carries a single instrument composed of three spectrometers that measure different regions of the spectrum of light. One of these spectrometers observes the spectrum of molecular oxygen, referred to as the A-band spectrum. This is important because molecular oxygen is a relatively constant fraction of the atmosphere and can be used as a reference for measurements of other atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide. In addition to being critical for calibrating the carbon dioxide concentrations, it also tells scientists how much sunlight is absorbed or reflected by the aerosols and clouds, features that CALIPSO and CloudSat observe. “If we combine the A-band spectrometer’s measurements with information on aerosols and clouds from CALIPSO and CloudSat, we can use that information to estimate the amount of absorption of sunlight by these airborne particles, which is something we cannot currently do,” said Dave Winker, principal investigator for the CALIPSO mission. CloudSat and CALIPSO also help clarify OCO-2’s data. The observatory uses its A-band spectrometer to find out how far sunlight has traveled before it reaches the satellite (its optical path) -- vital information for finding sources and sinks. A tiny mistake in the path-length measurement can introduce serious errors in the satellite’s carbon dioxide measurements. Often clouds and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere reflect some sunlight back toward space before it reaches the surface, shortening sunlight’s path and confusing the spectrometer about the distance to Earth. But CALIPSO and CloudSat’s data about the location and height of aerosols and clouds can verify OCO-2’s path-length measurements and determine what kept the sun from reaching Earth’s surface. “To check OCO-2’s accuracy, we can compare it to CloudSat and CALIPSO. These measurements are synergistic,” Crisp said. Winker noted, “From OCO-2’s point of view, CALIPSO is going to be very important in validating their measurement by correcting for cloud and aerosol effects. That these two satellites are flying together is a key part of the mission.” The A-Train’s other satellites support OCO-2’s work, too. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), an instrument on the Aqua satellite, tracks cloud cover. AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder), another Aqua instrument, measures air temperature and the amount of water content in the atmosphere. To accurately measure carbon dioxide, scientists must know all those details. “We have the platforms that can tell us about water vapor and temperature, as well as clouds from the CloudSat satellite, the CALIPSO satellite, the AIRS instrument, and the MODIS instrument. This is the right place to fly OCO-2,” Crisp said. An unusual boost in plant productivity can foreshadow severe soil water loss.

    "content": "4 min read NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, which launched on July 2, will soon be providing about 100,000 high-quality measurements each day of carbon dioxide concentrations from around the globe. Atmospheric scientists are excited about that. But to understand the processes that control the amount of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, they need to know more than just where carbon dioxide is now. They need to know where it has been. It takes more than great data to figure that out. \"In a sense, you're trying to go backward in time and space,\" said David Baker, a scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. \"You're reversing the flow of the winds to determine when and where the input of carbon at the Earth's surface had to be to give you the measurements you see now.\" Harry Potter used a magical time turner to travel to the past. Atmospheric scientists use a type of computer model called a chemical transport model. It combines the atmospheric processes found in a climate model with additional information on important chemical compounds, including their reactions, their sources on Earth's surface and the processes that remove them from the air, known as sinks. Baker used the example of a forest fire to explain how a chemical transport model works. \"Where the fire is, at that point in time, you get a pulse of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning carbon in wood. The model's winds blow it along, and mixing processes dilute it through the atmosphere. It gradually gets mixed into a wider and wider plume that eventually gets blown around the world.\" Some models can be run backward in time — from a point in the plume back to the fire, in other words — to search for the sources of airborne carbon dioxide. The reactions and processes that must be modeled are so complex that researchers often cycle their chemical transport models backward and forward through the same time period dozens of times, adjusting the model as each set of results reveals new clues. \"You basically start crawling toward a solution,\" Baker said. \"You may not be crawling straight toward the best answer, but you course-correct along the way.\" Lesley Ott, a climate modeler at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, noted that simulating carbon dioxide's atmospheric transport correctly is a prerequisite for improving the way global climate models simulate the carbon cycle and how it will change with our changing climate. \"If you get the transport piece right, then you can understand the piece about sources and sinks,\" she said. \"More and better-quality data from OCO-2 are going to create better characterization of global carbon.\" Baker noted that the volume of data provided by OCO-2 will improve knowledge of carbon processes on a finer scale than is currently possible. \"With all that coverage, we'll be able to resolve what's going on at the regional scale,\" Baker said, referring to areas the size of Texas or France. \"That will help us understand better how the forests and oceans take up carbon. There are various competing processes, and right now we're not sure which ones are most important.\" Ott pointed out that improving the way global climate models represent carbon dioxide provides benefits far beyond the scientific research community. \"Trying to figure out what national and international responses to climate change should be is really hard,\" she said. \"Politicians need answers quickly. Right now we have to trust a very small number of carbon dioxide observations. We're going to have a lot better coverage because so much more data is coming, and we may be able to see in better detail features of the carbon cycle that were missed before.\" Taking those OCO-2 data backward in time may be the next step forward on the road to understanding and adapting to climate change.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the leading human-produced greenhouse gas responsible for warming our world. It is a critical natural component of Earth’s carbon cycle. OCO-2 will produce the most detailed picture to date of sources of carbon dioxide, as well as their natural “sinks” — places on Earth’s surface where carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. The observatory will study how these sources and sinks are distributed around the globe and how they change over time. Following launch from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base on July 2, OCO-2 underwent a series of steps to configure the observatory for in-flight operations. Mission controllers established two-way communications with the observatory, stabilized its orientation in space and deployed its solar arrays to provide electrical power. The OCO-2 team then performed a checkout of OCO-2’s systems to ensure they were functioning properly. Through the month of July, a series of propulsive burns was executed to maneuver the observatory into its final 438-mile (705-kilometer), near-polar orbit at the head of the international Afternoon Constellation, or “A-Train,” of Earth-observing satellites. It arrived there on Aug. 3. Operations are now being conducted with the observatory in an orbit that crosses the equator at 1:36 p.m. local time. The A-Train, the first multi-satellite, formation-flying “super observatory” to record the health of Earth’s atmosphere and surface environment, collects an unprecedented quantity of nearly simultaneous climate and weather measurements. OCO-2 is now followed by the Japanese GCOM-W1 satellite, and then by NASA’s Aqua, CALIPSO, CloudSat and Aura spacecraft, respectively — all of which fly over the same point on Earth within 16 minutes of each other. With OCO-2 in its final orbit, mission controllers began cooling the observatory’s three-spectrometer instrument to its operating temperatures. The spectrometer’s optical components must be cooled to near 21 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 degrees Celsius) to bring them into focus and limit the amount of heat they radiate. The instrument’s detectors must be even cooler, near minus 243 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 153 degrees Celsius), to maximize their sensitivity. With the instrument’s optical system and detectors near their stable operating temperatures, the OCO-2 team collected “first light” test data on Aug. 6 as the observatory flew over central Papua New Guinea. The data were transmitted from OCO-2 to a ground station in Alaska, then to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, for initial decoding, and then to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, for further processing. The test provided the OCO-2 team with its first opportunity to see whether the instrument had reached orbit with the same performance it had demonstrated before launch. As OCO-2 flies over Earth’s sunlit hemisphere, each spectrometer collects a “frame” three times each second, for a total of about 9,000 frames from each orbit. Each frame is divided into eight spectra, or chemical signatures, that record the amount of molecular oxygen or carbon dioxide over adjacent ground footprints. Each footprint is about 1.3 miles (2.25 kilometers) long and a few hundred yards (meters) wide. When displayed as an image, the eight spectra appear like bar codes — bright bands of light broken by sharp dark lines. The dark lines indicate absorption by molecular oxygen or carbon dioxide. “The initial data from OCO-2 appear exactly as expected — the spectral lines are well resolved, sharp and deep,” said OCO-2 chief architect and calibration lead Randy Pollock of JPL. “We still have a lot of work to do to go from having a working instrument to having a well-calibrated and scientifically useful instrument, but this was an important milestone on this journey.” Over the next several weeks, the OCO-2 team will conduct a series of calibration activities to characterize fully the performance of the instrument and observatory. In parallel, OCO-2 will routinely record and return up to 1 million science observations each day. These data will be used initially to test the ground processing system and verify its products. The team will begin delivering calibrated OCO-2 spectra data to NASA’s Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center for distribution to the global science community and other interested parties before the end of the year. The team will also deliver estimates of carbon dioxide to that same center for distribution in early",

Credit: NASA GISS/Lilly Del Valle By Kathryn Hansen NASA's Earth Science News Team Water vapor and clouds are the major contributors to Earth's greenhouse effect, but a new atmosphere-ocean climate modeling study shows that the planet's temperature ultimately depends on the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide. The study, conducted by Andrew Lacis and colleagues at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York, examined the nature of Earth's greenhouse effect and clarified the role that greenhouse gases and clouds play in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Notably, the team identified non-condensing greenhouse gases — such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons — as providing the core support for the terrestrial greenhouse effect. Without non-condensing greenhouse gases, water vapor and clouds would be unable to provide the feedback mechanisms that amplify the greenhouse effect. The study's results will be published Friday, Oct. 15 in Science. A companion study led by GISS co-author Gavin Schmidt that has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research shows that carbon dioxide accounts for about 20 percent of the greenhouse effect, water vapor and clouds together account for 75 percent, and minor gases and aerosols make up the remaining five percent. However, it is the 25 percent non-condensing greenhouse gas component, which includes carbon dioxide, that is the key factor in sustaining Earth’s greenhouse effect. By this accounting, carbon dioxide is responsible for 80 percent of the radiative forcing that sustains the Earth’s greenhouse effect. The climate forcing experiment described in Science was simple in design and concept — all of the non-condensing greenhouse gases and aerosols were zeroed out, and the global climate model was run forward in time to see what would happen to the greenhouse effect. Without the sustaining support by the non-condensing greenhouse gases, Earth’s greenhouse effect collapsed as water vapor quickly precipitated from the atmosphere, plunging the model Earth into an icebound state — a clear demonstration that water vapor, although contributing 50 percent of the total greenhouse warming, acts as a feedback process, and as such, cannot by itself uphold the Earth's greenhouse effect. \"Our climate modeling simulation should be viewed as an experiment in atmospheric physics, illustrating a cause and effect problem which allowed us to gain a better understanding of the working mechanics of Earth’s greenhouse effect, and enabled us to demonstrate the direct relationship that exists between rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and rising global temperature,\" Lacis said. The study ties in to the geologic record in which carbon dioxide levels have oscillated between approximately 180 parts per million during ice ages, and about 280 parts per million during warmer interglacial periods. To provide perspective to the nearly 1°C (1.8°F) increase in global temperature over the past century, it is estimated that the global mean temperature difference between the extremes of the ice age and interglacial periods is only about 5°C (9°F). \"When carbon dioxide increases, more water vapor returns to the atmosphere. This is what helped to melt the glaciers that once covered New York City,\" said co-author David Rind, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. \"Today we are in uncharted territory as carbon dioxide approaches 390 parts per million in what has been referred to as the 'superinterglacial.'\" \"The bottom line is that atmospheric carbon dioxide acts as a thermostat in regulating the temperature of Earth,\" Lacis said. \"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has fully documented the fact that industrial activity is responsible for the rapidly increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It is not surprising then that global warming can be linked directly to the observed increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and to human industrial activity in general.\" Related Links: GISS Science Brief: The Thermostat that Controls Earth's Temperature GISS Science Brief: Taking the Measure of the Greenhouse Effect NASA GISS: Andrew Lacis NASA GISS: David Rind NASA GISS: Gavin Schmidt Water Vapor Confirmed as Major Player in Climate Change This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "By Patrick Lynch, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center An ultra-high-resolution NASA computer model has given scientists a stunning new look at how carbon dioxide in the atmosphere travels around the globe. Plumes of carbon dioxide in the simulation swirl and shift as winds disperse the greenhouse gas away from its sources. The simulation also illustrates differences in carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres and distinct swings in global carbon dioxide concentrations as the growth cycle of plants and trees changes with the seasons. Scientists have made ground-based measurements of carbon dioxide for decades and in July NASA launched the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite to make global, space-based carbon observations. But the simulation — the product of a new computer model that is among the highest-resolution ever created — is the first to show in such fine detail how carbon dioxide actually moves through the atmosphere. “While the presence of carbon dioxide has dramatic global consequences, it’s fascinating to see how local emission sources and weather systems produce gradients of its concentration on a very regional scale,” said Bill Putman, lead scientist on the project from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Simulations like this, combined with data from observations, will help improve our understanding of both human emissions of carbon dioxide and natural fluxes across the globe.” The carbon dioxide visualization was produced by a computer model called GEOS-5, created by scientists at NASA Goddard’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. In particular, the visualization is part of a simulation called a “Nature Run.” The Nature Run ingests real data on atmospheric conditions and the emission of greenhouse gases and both natural and man-made particulates. The model is then is left to run on its own and simulate the natural behavior of the Earth’s atmosphere. This Nature Run simulates May",

    "content": "4 min read A new space-based instrument to study how effectively plants use water is being developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The instrument, called the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), will monitor one of the most basic processes in living plants: the loss of water through the tiny pores in leaves. When people lose water through their pores, the process is called sweating. The related process in plants is known as transpiration. Because water that evaporates from soil around plants also affects the amount of water that plants can use, ECOSTRESS will measure combined evaporation and transpiration, known as evapotranspiration. “When a person sweats during a workout, it helps cool their body, and if they get enough water they can keep exercising,\" said Simon Hook, a research scientist at JPL and the project’s principal investigator. \"If they do not get enough water, they show signs of overheating and stress and eventually collapse. Similarly, if plants do not get enough water, they show signs of stress. By measuring evapotranspiration, we get an early indicator of that stress, and we can do something about it before the plants collapse.\" ECOSTRESS’s science instrument is a high-resolution thermal infrared radiometer, which works like a giant thermometer from space to measure the temperature of plants and the amount of heat radiating from Earth’s surface. \"If we find a plant is too hot, that's because it’s not getting enough water to cool itself down,\" said Josh Fisher, a JPL research scientist and science lead for ECOSTRESS. “We see in our own gardens that one type of plant needs more water to grow than the next plant, but we have not been able to see this on a global scale,\" Fisher noted. \"That has huge implications for our understanding of global water and carbon cycling, and which plants are going to live or die in a future world of greater droughts.” Existing satellite instruments that monitor evapotranspiration offer either high spatial resolution but low time frequency (a couple of measurements a month), or high time frequency and coarse spatial resolution (1,600 feet, or 500 meters square). Scientists, farmers and water managers need both high resolution and high frequency. ECOSTRESS will provide a four-day repeat cycle and a spatial resolution of 125 feet (38 meters) by 185 feet (57 meters), high enough to see most farms and small differences within ecosystems. \"We are keeping an eye on how ECOSTRESS can be applied not only to science but society at large,\" said Andy French, a U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist and member of the mission’s team. \"It could be very useful for water managers and farmers.\" By combining the instrument’s measurements with other ecosystem data, scientists will be able to calculate how efficiently plants use water to process carbon dioxide and identify plants likely to be more resilient during droughts. The mission will target regions where models disagree about water use efficiency, and ECOSTRESS data will be used to improve those models. The International Space Station provides a particularly beneficial vantage point not regularly available with traditional free-flying (sun-synchronous polar-orbiting) satellites, which fly over the same spot on Earth at the same time on each pass. The station's orbit shifts so that it flies over any given spot on Earth at different times. By looking at ECOSTRESS imagery of a certain location over the course of days to weeks, scientists will be able to see how evapotranspiration varies in that location throughout the day. This is important, because plants that get enough water in the cool of the morning might shut down in afternoon heat, just as a person stops sweating under extreme heat stress. Up until now, scientists have not known at the global scale in which ecosystems plants shut down in the afternoon and in which ecosystems plants do not, and what environmental conditions influence this basic characteristic.

    "content": "3 min read A NASA spacecraft designed to track Earth's water in one of its most important, but least recognized, forms — soil moisture — now is at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, to begin final preparations for launch in January. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) spacecraft arrived Wednesday at its launch site on California's central coast after traveling from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The spacecraft will undergo final tests and then be integrated on top of a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket in preparation for a planned Jan. 29 launch. SMAP will provide the most accurate, highest-resolution global measurements of soil moisture ever obtained from space and will detect whether the ground is frozen or thawed. The data will be used to enhance scientists' understanding of the processes that link Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles. Soil moisture is critical for plant growth and supplies aquifers, which are underground water supplies contained in layers of rock, sand or dirt. Through evaporation, water in the soil cools the land surface and lower atmosphere while seeding the upper atmosphere with moisture that forms clouds and rain. High-resolution global maps of soil moisture produced from SMAP will allow scientists to understand how regional water availability is changing and inform water resource management decisions. \"Water is vital for all life on Earth, and the water present in soil is a small but critically important part of Earth's water cycle,\" said Kent Kellogg, SMAP project manager at JPL. \"The delivery of NASA's SMAP spacecraft to Vandenberg Air Force Base marks a final step to bring these unique and valuable measurements to the global science community.\" SMAP data also will aid in predictions of plant growth and agricultural productivity, improve weather and climate forecasts and enhance our ability to predict the extent and severity of droughts and where floods may occur. SMAP's freeze/thaw data will also be used to detect changes in the length of the growing season, which is an indicator of how much carbon plants take up from the atmosphere each year. Among the users of SMAP data will be hydrologists, weather forecasters, climate scientists and agricultural and water resource managers. Additional users include fire hazard and flood disaster managers, disease control and prevention managers, emergency planners and policy makers. To make its high-resolution, high-accuracy measurements, SMAP will combine data from two microwave instruments — a synthetic aperture radar and a radiometer — in a way that uses the best features of each. The instruments can peer through clouds and moderate vegetation cover day and night to measure water in the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of the soil. SMAP will fly in a 426-mile (685-kilometer) altitude, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit that crosses the equator near 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. local time. SMAP is designed to operate for at least three years, producing a global map of soil moisture every two to three days. SMAP is planned to be the final of five NASA Earth science missions launched into space in a 12-month period, the most new NASA Earth-observing mission launches in that timespan in more than a decade.

Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are floating the idea that airships have potential for important scientific and commercial uses. NASA is considering issuing a challenge for developing stratospheric airships that can break records in terms of duration of flight at high altitudes. The agency has issued a request for information for this contemplated \"20-20-20 Airship Challenge.\" Submissions will be accepted until December 1. \"We are seeking to take astronomy and Earth science to new heights by enabling a long-duration, suborbital platform for these kinds of research,\" said Jason Rhodes, an astrophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who is leading the effort on the possible challenge. A blimp is one example of an airship; a zeppelin, which has a rigid body, is another. By definition, an airship must be powered, navigable, and lighter than air. The idea behind the 20-20-20 Airship Challenge would be to achieve unprecedented airship milestones. The first \"tier\" of competition would be to get an airship with a 44-pound (20 kilogram) payload to stay at an altitude of 65,000 feet (20 kilometers) for 20 hours. More ambitious ship-builders can aim for the second tier, with the same height but carrying a 440-pound (200-kilogram) payload for 200 hours. \"The 65,000-foot mark is the sweet spot where the airship would get as high as possible while still having enough air to propel against, because it needs propulsion to stay in the same spot. It's also a good altitude in terms of average wind speed,\" Rhodes said. So far, no powered airship has been able to sustain this altitude for more than eight hours. Balloons do fly at this height — for example, weather balloons — but they are subject to prevailing winds, and may be less reliable. In the framework being considered, the total airship prize purse may range from 2 to 3 million dollars, and could be split into multiple prize awards for successful demonstrations of the two competition tiers. NASA's request for information is to gauge the interest among various communities that would be interested in using the airships or directly constructing them. A",

    "date": null,
    "content": "7 min read Yi-Chun Chen has spent years studying the low clouds that linger over Earth’s ocean but has never been out to sea. As a postdoctoral scholar at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Chen writes computer programs to simulate cloud formation, then runs them and compares the results to satellite measurements. Chen is a numerical modeler, a scientist who uses a series of equations to study the natural world. Chen’s latest paper, published in the journal Nature Geosciences in August, suggests that precipitation, temperature and humidity all have a say in how clouds respond to very tiny atmospheric particles called aerosols. The better she understands these micro-level processes, the more she can help scientists trying to model larger systems, including our planet and its future. Ninety percent of aerosols, like dust, smoke and ash, come from natural processes like wildfires. Human activity produces the remaining 10 percent, including black carbon, CFCs and sulfates. Scientists know aerosols affect the amount of water in a cloud, how easily they form raindrops and how much sunlight they reflect, but don’t know exactly what impact they have. “We’d like to see a simple linear relationship between aerosols and clouds, but it’s much more complicated,” Chen said. “Aerosol-cloud interactions are the leading source of uncertainty in our predictions of future climate.” For example, scientists know aerosols act as seeds for clouds to form. When there are more in the atmosphere than usual, the clouds that form contain many small water droplets instead of fewer, larger droplets, meaning they cover more area. That allows them to reflect more sunlight, which keeps Earth’s surface cooler. A planet's surface reflectivity is called albedo, and these low marine clouds have a greater influence on Earth’s albedo than any other cloud type. Some studies suggest that, if ocean cloud albedo increased by just 6 percent, it could offset the global warming caused by doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. But the system is much too complicated to make simple assumptions about the overall effect of aerosols, Chen said. “We think we want higher cloud albedo so the Earth would be cooler,” Chen said. “But, in reality, there are other things going on, like air mixing into clouds. When aerosols make cloud droplets smaller, more of the dry, warm air from above the clouds mixes into them. When that dry air comes into the cloud, it causes more evaporation, causing clouds to decrease or even disappear. That can result in lower cloud albedo and less precipitation.” Ultimately, Chen and her colleagues concluded that the state of precipitation – whether or not it’s raining – and tropospheric stability – how fast air is moving up and down – help control the impact aerosols have on how much water clouds contain. The amount of water, in turn, affects clouds’ albedo. Of studies based on satellite data, the August paper was the first to look at the effects of both aerosols and local weather conditions on marine stratus clouds. Both change the amount of clouds in the atmosphere and those clouds’ internal properties. A NASA co-author, Graeme Stephens, said the experiment suggested aerosols produce an albedo effect twice as intense as the one estimated in the latest IPCC report. Chen performed this whole experiment using a special type of mathematical model, called a large-eddy simulation, to represent the short lives of clouds with a resolution of about a square mile (2.5 square kilometers). It would take 200 million of those boxes to surround Earth. “Nowadays, high-resolution models represent aerosol-cloud interactions pretty well, because we’ve been able to resolve these small-scale microphysics,” Chen said. “Trying to study the whole globe is another story. Running that simulation would take a very, very, very long time.” Chen’s models include dozens of variables, but they represent a single, uncoupled system. JPL’s Jui-Lin Frank Li uses models that unite many of these smaller-scale components, which represent systems like Earth’s ocean, atmosphere and sea ice very well, into global climate models that show how the systems interact with one another. These coupled models also divide Earth into grid boxes for processing, but Li’s smallest are about 6 square miles (10 square kilometers) – six times the size of Chen’s cloud-focused programs. “Models divide the Earth into a grid and take averages of each of the grid’s boxes to represent nature,” Li said. “Many clouds are smaller than the boxes, and they can be averaged, but they cannot be ignored because they can also cause rain or block the sun. We try to estimate what fraction of each box is covered by clouds based on information from observations.” Estimating how much of the sky is covered by clouds is one of the biggest challenges modelers face. David Randall, a climate modeler at Colorado State University, uses another type of program called a super-parameterized model. Randall’s models also divide the globe into boxes, but instead of inputting data daily or weekly and running equations, he embeds high-resolution models like Chen’s within each box. “The super-parameterized model is a couple hundred times slower on the computer than the parameterized model, but it gives considerably better results.

    "content": "4 min read A three-dimensional view of the age and structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet Scientists using ice-penetrating radar data collected by NASA’s Operation IceBridge and earlier airborne campaigns have built the first-ever comprehensive map of layers deep inside the Greenland Ice Sheet. Peering into the thousands of frozen layers inside Greenland’s ice sheet is like looking back in time. Each layer provides a record of what Earth’s climate was like at the dawn of civilization, or during the last ice age, or during an ancient period of warmth similar to the one we experience today. Credit: NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio. Download this video in HD formats from NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio. This new map allows scientists to determine the age of large swaths of Greenland’s ice, extending ice core data for a better picture of the ice sheet’s history. “This new, huge data volume records how the ice sheet evolved and how it’s flowing today,” said Joe MacGregor, a glaciologist at The University of Texas at Austin’s Institute for Geophysics and the study’s lead author. Greenland’s ice sheet is the second largest mass of ice on Earth, containing enough water to raise ocean levels by about 20 feet. The ice sheet has been losing mass over the past two decades and warming temperatures will mean more losses for Greenland. Scientists are studying ice from different climate periods in the past to better understand how the ice sheet might respond in the future. One way of studying this distant past is with ice cores. These cylinders of ice drilled from the ice sheet hold evidence of past snow accumulation and temperature and contain impurities like dust and volcanic ash that were carried by snow that accumulated and compacted over hundreds of thousands of years. These layers are visible in ice cores and can be detected with ice-penetrating radar. Ice-penetrating radar works by sending radar signals into the ice and recording the strength and return time of reflected signals. From those signals, scientists can detect the ice surface, sub-ice bedrock and layers within the ice. New techniques used in this study allowed scientists to efficiently pick out these layers in radar data. Prior studies had mapped internal layers, but not at the scale made possible by these newer, faster methods. Another major factor in this study was the amount of Greenland IceBridge has measured. “IceBridge surveyed previously unexplored parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet and did it using state-of-the-art CReSIS radars,” said study co-author, Mark Fahnestock, a glaciologist from the Geophysical Institute at University of Alaska Fairbanks and IceBridge science team member. CReSIS is the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center headquartered at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. IceBridge’s flight lines often intersect ice core sites where other scientists have analyzed the ice’s chemical composition to map and date layers in the ice. These core data provide a reference for radar measurements and provide a way to calculate how much ice from a given climate period exists across the ice sheet, something known as an age volume. Scientists are interested in knowing more about ice from the Eemian period, a time from 115,000 to 130,000 years ago that was roughly as warm as today. This new age volume provides the first rough estimate of where Eemian ice may remain. Comparing this age volume to simple computer models helped the study’s team better understand the ice sheet’s history. Differences in the mapped and modeled age volumes point to past changes in ice flow or processes like melting at the ice sheet’s base. This information will be helpful for evaluating the more sophisticated ice sheet models that are crucial for projecting Greenland’s future contribution to sea-level rise. “Prior to this study, a good ice-sheet model was one that got its present thickness and surface speed right. Now, they’ll also be able to work on getting its history right, which is important because ice sheets have very long memories,” said MacGregor. This study was published online on Jan. 16,",

The new study is the first to devise a way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of carbon dioxide estimates from many sources at different scales: computer models of ecosystem processes, atmospheric models run backward in time to deduce the sources of today's concentrations (called inverse models), satellite images, data from experimental forest plots and more. The researchers reconciled all types of analyses and assessed the accuracy of the results based on how well they reproduced independent, ground-based measurements. They obtained their new estimate of the tropical carbon absorption from the models they determined to be the most trusted and verified. \"Until our analysis, no one had successfully completed a global reconciliation of information about carbon dioxide effects from the atmospheric, forestry and modeling communities,\" said co-author Joshua Fisher of JPL. \"It is incredible that all these different types of independent data sources start to converge on an answer.\" The question of which type of forest is the bigger carbon absorber \"is not just an accounting curiosity,\" said co-author Britton Stephens of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado. \"It has big implications for our understanding of whether global terrestrial ecosystems might continue to offset our carbon dioxide emissions or might begin to exacerbate climate change.\" As human-caused emissions add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, forests worldwide are using it to grow faster, reducing the amount that stays airborne. This effect is called carbon fertilization. \"All else being equal, the effect is stronger at higher temperatures, meaning it will be higher in the tropics than in the boreal forests,\" Schimel said. But climate change also decreases water availability in some regions and makes Earth warmer, leading to more frequent and larger wildfires. In the tropics, humans compound the problem by burning wood during deforestation. Fires don't just stop carbon absorption by killing trees, they also spew huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere as the wood burns. For about 25 years, most computer climate models have been showing that mid-latitude forests in the Northern Hemisphere absorb more carbon than tropical forests. That result was initially based on the then-current understanding of global air flows and limited data suggesting that deforestation was causing tropical forests to release more carbon dioxide than they were absorbing.

The new finding is published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The research is dedicated to the memory of coauthor Alberto Behar of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, who died in a small-plane crash in Los Angeles on Jan. 9. Eighty percent of Greenland, which is about the size of the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, is covered by ice, which has the potential to make a significant contribution to sea level rise as it melts. Because Greenland's ice sheet is vast and difficult to study from ground level, scientists are still learning about the many processes by which its melting water reaches the ocean. This is the first study of the drainage system of rivers and streams that forms atop the ice sheet in summer.

    "content": "By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Earth Science News Team The skyline of downtown Los Angeles on a summer morning. Credit: Basil D. Soufi / Wikimedia Commons A NASA study using two years of observations from a novel mountaintop instrument finds that Los Angeles' annual emissions of methane, an important greenhouse gas, are 18 to 61 percent higher than widely used estimates. The study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of long-term mapping of greenhouse gases across an urban area from an elevated—but still earthbound—site. \"For the first time, we've been able to provide an accurate estimate of total methane emissions from the Los Angeles basin, whatever their sources,\" said senior research scientist Stanley Sander of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, the new instrument's principal investigator. \"Altogether, it's a very significant increase in the estimate.\" The CLARS observatory on Mt. Wilson in southern California's San Gabriel Mountains. Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Methane is extremely efficient at trapping heat and warming the planet. Its urban sources include gas pipeline leaks, landfills, wastewater treatment plants and transportation. The study used observations by an instrument called a spectrometer, which measures the effect of methane and other gases on the spectrum of sunlight, allowing it to \"count\" the number of molecules in the air above LA. The instrument is part of the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS), located about 5,700 feet (1,700 meters) above Los Angeles atop Mt. Wilson. Because of regional air patterns, virtually none of LA's pollution drifts as high as the CLARS site, but all of it is within view. \"The instrument is like a stationary satellite,\" said Clare Wong, a NASA postdoctoral fellow at JPL and lead author of a paper on the new study in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Every 90 minutes during daylight hours, the CLARS spectrometer points at one after another of 28 flat, unobstructed sites throughout the Los Angeles basin, including Angels Stadium in Anaheim and the Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia. The spectrometer measures how much methane, carbon dioxide and other pollutants are in the air between it and each site. It also takes a measurement in the clean air above the mountain. The difference between the clean-air and ground-site measurements gives the amount of methane in the LA basin. Over the sprawling 30-by-70-mile LA basin (50 by 110 kilometers), methane emissions were estimated to be 430,000 U.S. tons (0.39 teragrams) per year. This is significantly larger than the value obtained by the common method of adding up estimated emissions from all known methane sources. Although the study was not specifically designed to find out where the methane is coming from, \"certain areas seem to be more significant emitters than others,\" Sander said. \"The ones we have been able to identify are—perhaps coincidentally, but perhaps not—located near large landfills. That is consistent with our understanding that landfills have the potential to be methane sources under certain conditions.\" The highest concentrations were recorded at ground sites in eastern Los Angeles County and near the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The mountaintop instrument is part of the pilot Megacities Carbon Project to monitor emissions from urban areas with populations of more than 10 million. Cities are the source of about 70 percent of the world's carbon emissions, and Earth's 22 megacities are responsible for about half of that 70 percent. Sander noted that a setup like CLARS would work equally well in other megacities that are overlooked by mountains, such as Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Mexico City. The Megacities Carbon Project LA site is funded by NASA; the National Institute of Standards and Technology; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Keck Institute for Space Studies, Pasadena, California; and the California Air Resources Board, Sacramento, California.

While methane is much less prevalent in Earth's atmosphere than carbon dioxide, molecule for molecule, it packs a much bigger punch, particularly on short timescales. Because of its potency and potential to contribute to climate change, scientists are interested in how its concentrations may be changing.Currently, more than half of atmospheric methane comes from human-related sources, such as livestock, landfills and leaks of natural gas into the atmosphere during its extraction, storage, transportation and distribution.Natural gas is primarily composed of methane.

Soil moisture links together the cycles of water, solar energy and carbon in plants. Credit: USDA When you open the back of a fine watch, you see layer upon layer of spinning wheels linked by interlocking cogs, screws and wires. Some of the cogs are so tiny they're barely visible. Size doesn't matter — what's important is that the cogs fit together well so the wheels keep turning smoothly. For centuries, scientists have thought of the Earth system as a series of cycles or interlocking wheels like the ones in a watch. It's a way to make sense of the movements of water and other essentials back and forth between the air and the land, ocean and soil or rock beneath them. In today's changing climate, some cycles are spinning faster or beginning to wobble. There's an urgent need to understand what is happening to the cogs that keep these cycles turning. The minuscule fraction of Earth's water lodged just beneath the land surface is a tiny cog that links the water cycle to two other fundamental Earth cycles: energy and carbon. \"That linkage is what makes these three gears turn with a certain harmony,\" said Dara Entekhabi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. Entekhabi is science team leader for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission, scheduled to launch Jan. 29. Developed and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, SMAP will provide the most accurate information ever about this small but critical cog. You may have learned about the water cycle in school: Water falls from the sky to the land when it rains or snows, and rises from the land back to the sky when it heats up and evaporates. Your teacher may not have mentioned that water vapor isn't the only thing that rises. The heat energy that turned liquid water into vapor also rises, cooling Earth's surface. In fact, evaporating soil moisture is the main way that land sheds the solar energy it receives every day and thus is a major player in the energy cycle. \"It's the first process to kick in when the surface heats up, and it continues as long as there is moisture in the soil that can evaporate,\" Entekhabi said. Evaporation gets rid of nearly half of the solar energy that reaches land, keeping our planet's temperature comfortable. If there's any moisture at all in soil, there's probably a plant growing there. That's why most evaporation from soil starts with a plant absorbing water through its roots. Plants need water for photosynthesis, their food-creating process. During photosynthesis they \"sweat\" — or transpire — water onto their leaves, where it evaporates. Besides using water and energy, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Over land, this is virtually the only natural way for carbon to be removed from the atmosphere. Soil moisture keeps this vital carbon highway open by enabling plants to continue growing. \"If a plant has access to water, it happily carries on with photosynthesis,\" Entekhabi said. \"If not, the plant shuts down, and eventually it wilts and dies.\" After SMAP launches, the new data it will provide are expected to help scientists answer some long-standing questions about what is likely to happen to these important Earth cycles in a changing climate. Entekhabi hopes to take advantage of the synergy available between SMAP and NASA's new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, which measures global carbon dioxide. \"We have talked a lot with the OCO-2 scientists about how we can use simultaneous measurements to solve the puzzle of how plants respond to soil moisture and how the carbon cycle and the water cycle are linked,\" he said. \"If we get that linkage right, we will reduce the uncertainty in future climate projections and know more about how terrestrial plants are going to act in the future.\" SMAP will be the last of five NASA Earth science launches within 12 months.

    "content": "6 min read Nitrogen and oxygen comprise nearly 99 percent of Earth’s atmosphere. The remaining one percent is comprised of gases that — although present in small concentrations — can have a big impact on life on Earth. Trace gases called greenhouse gases warm the surface, making it habitable for humans, plants and animals. But these greenhouse gases, as well as clouds and tiny particles called aerosols in the atmosphere, also play vital roles in Earth’s complex climate system. Celebrating its tenth anniversary this week, NASA’s Aura satellite and its four onboard instruments measure some of the climate agents in the atmosphere including greenhouse gases, clouds and dust particles. These global datasets provide clues that help scientists understand how Earth’s climate has varied and how it will continue to change. When the sun shines on Earth, some of the light reaches and warms the surface. The surface then radiates this heat back outward, and greenhouse gases stop some of the heat from escaping to space, keeping the surface warm. Greenhouse gases are necessary to keep Earth at a habitable temperature, but since the industrial revolution, greenhouse gases have increased substantially, causing an increase in temperature. Aura provides measurements of greenhouses gases such as ozone and water vapor, helping scientists understand the gases that influence climate. People, plants and animals live in the layer of the atmosphere called the troposphere. In this layer, the temperature decreases with altitude, as mountain climbers experience. The temperature starts to increase again at the tropopause, a surface located about eight miles above the surface at temperate latitudes, which includes, for example, the U.S. and Europe. Closer to the equator, the tropopause is about 11 miles from the surface. In the middle and upper troposphere, ozone acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere. Tropospheric ozone is one of the most important human-influenced greenhouse gases. Aura’s Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) delivers global maps showing annual averages of the heat absorbed by ozone, in particular in this middle troposphere altitude region. Using these maps and computer models, researchers learned that ozone trapped different amounts of heat in Earth’s atmosphere depending on its geographic location. For instance, ozone appeared to be a more effective greenhouse gas over hotter regions like the tropics or cloud-free regions like the Middle East. “If you want to understand climate change, you need to monitor the greenhouse gases and how they change over time,” said Bryan Duncan, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Along with ozone, Aura measures other important greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor. In addition to greenhouse gases, Aura measures several other constituents relevant to climate — smoke, dust and clouds including the ice particles within the clouds — that are important for testing and improving climate models. “If you don’t have any data, then you don’t know if the models are right or not,” said Anne Douglass, Aura Project Scientist at Goddard. “The models can only be as good as your knowledge.” Clouds affect Earth’s climate depending on their altitude and latitude. Two of Aura’s instruments have provided information about tropical clouds. Like greenhouse gases, high, thin clouds in the tropics absorb some of Earth’s outgoing heat and warm the surface. Aura’s High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) instrument provided global maps showing cirrus clouds in the upper altitudes in the tropics. Researchers have used these data along with data records from previous satellites going back to",

    "content": "5 min read Like a cowboy at a rodeo, NASA's newest Earth-observing satellite, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), has triumphantly raised its \"arm\" and unfurled a huge golden \"lasso\" (antenna) that it will soon spin up to rope the best soil moisture maps ever obtained from space. Launched Jan. 31 from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Delta II rocket, SMAP is now literally riding tall in the saddle as it continues to successfully wrangle the checkout procedures of its three-month-long commissioning phase. Analyses of onboard inertial measurement unit data and other telemetry confirm the antenna deployment, performed Feb. 24, was completely successful. SMAP's minimum three-year mission will expand our understanding of soil moisture, a key component of the Earth system that links the water, energy and carbon cycles driving our planet. SMAP's combined radar and radiometer instruments will peer into the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of soil, through clouds and moderate vegetation cover, day and night, to produce the highest-resolution, most accurate soil moisture maps ever obtained from space. SMAP also will detect whether ground is frozen or thawed. Detecting variations in timing of spring thaw and changes in growing season length will help scientists more accurately account for how much carbon plants are removing from the atmosphere each year. Following its picture-perfect launch and insertion into orbit, mission controllers performed a series of health checks of the observatory's subsystems. They also ran successful initial health checks of SMAP's radiometer and radar science instruments, powering them on for 30 hours in receive-only mode and processing the data. Then on Feb. 18, mission controllers successfully commanded SMAP's 16-foot (5-meter) two-hinged boom to unfold and extend. On Feb. 24, the team commanded SMAP's reflector antenna at the end of the boom to deploy. Designed and built by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman Corporation company located in Carpenteria, California, under subcontract to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, SMAP's reflector boom assembly is an advanced, low-mass rotating deployable mesh reflector antenna system that supports the collection of SMAP's radar and radiometric measurements in space. It is the first-ever spinning and precision mass-balanced deployable mesh reflector antenna, and is the largest spinning mesh reflector ever deployed in space. The reflector boom assembly enables SMAP to meet its requirements for high accuracy and high spatial resolution in its soil moisture measurements, and achieve global coverage every two to three days using a single small observatory and medium-lift-class launch vehicle. Astro Aerospace experts have preliminarily determined that the deployed natural frequency of the reflector boom assembly in orbit is nearly identical to prelaunch model predictions. This provides confidence in the health of the deployed reflector and in its performance once spun up. For launch, the flexible mesh antenna, which is edged with a ring of lightweight graphite supports called a perimeter truss, had been tightly folded and stowed into a volume of just 1 foot by 4 feet (30 by 120 centimeters). Upon deployment, the truss slowly opened, like a camp chair, to its full diameter of almost 20 feet (6-meters). Despite its size, the reflector weighs in at a mere 56 pounds (25 kilograms). With its supporting boom and launch restraints, the entire reflector and boom assembly weighs just 127 pounds (58 kilograms). \"Deploying large, low-mass structures in space is never easy and is one of the larger engineering challenges NASA missions can confront in development,\" said Kent Kellogg, SMAP project manager at JPL. \"This week's result culminates more than six years of challenging reflector and boom assembly development, system engineering and an extensive test campaign. With this key milestone in our rear-view mirror, the team now looks forward to completing the remainder of our commissioning activities and beginning routine science operations for this important mission with broad applications for science and society.\" Later this week, SMAP's science instruments will be checked out with the deployed reflector antenna in a non-spinning configuration. This will mark the observatory's first operation with the reflector and boom assembly functioning as an antenna to view Earth. It will also mark the first time SMAP's radar high-power amplifier will transmit a signal. In about a month, after additional tests and maneuvers to adjust the observatory to its final 426-mile (685-kilometer), near-polar operational science orbit, SMAP's \"lasso\" antenna will do a sort of Texas two-step, spinning up in a two-stage process to nearly 15 revolutions per minute. By rotating, the antenna will be able to measure a 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) swath of Earth below, allowing SMAP to map the globe every two to three days. SMAP science operations will then begin, and SMAP data will be calibrated and validated. The first release of SMAP soil moisture data products is expected within nine months. Fully validated science data are expected to be released within 15 months. SMAP will have broad benefits for society. It will help improve climate and weather forecasts and allow scientists to monitor droughts and better predict flooding caused by rainfall or snowmelt — information that can save lives and property. In addition, since plant growth depends on the amount of water in the soil, SMAP data will allow nations to better forecast crop yields and assist in global famine early-warning systems. SMAP is managed for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington by JPL, with instrument hardware and science contributions made by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. JPL built the spacecraft and is responsible for project management, system engineering, radar instrumentation, mission operations and the ground data system.

He does. But he’s found that teaching people about it often induces despair. “I've given tons of talks about global warming and climate change in my professional life,” he said. “People would say, ‘how do you sleep at night?’” He decided that what he needed to help the message go down with less hopeless anxiety was a spoonful of sugar in the form of a Second City comedy show. “I think helping people laugh about it kind of breaks that spell a little bit and gets people thinking and beginning to accept it,” he said, “and then, hopefully, beginning to ask, what can we do about it?” Chicago-based The Second City, whose alumni include Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell and Mike Myers, operates an improvisational-comedy school in Los Angeles from which Willis graduated in February",

It’s flooded with sunshine 24/7 during its two-week-long daytime, so it makes sense to use solar energy to power future lunar rovers and other devices. But each lunar day is followed by two weeks of lunar night, and that means a long stretch of downtime after the sun sets. Stockpiling two weeks worth of the energy needed to power a robotic exploration vehicle -- like the “Curiosity” rover on Mars -- in a manner suitable for future lunar missions is currently beyond our capability. So NASA has issued a challenge to America’s technologists: Come up with a way for a rover to store enough solar energy to work through the lunar night and win your share of a $1.5 million prize. It can be an advanced battery, a fuel cell system, or even a flywheel of some sort as long as it meets the requirements set forth in the challenge’s rules. Any individual, group or company not receiving federal funds for projects related to energy storage is eligible to compete (other than from countries on the State Department’s Designated Countries list), but only U.S. citizens can receive the prize money.

    "content": "3 min read By Steve ColeNASA Headquarters Ruth Dasso MarlaireNASA Ames Research Center NASA scientists and an international team of researchers have found tropical ecosystems can generate significant carbon dioxide when temperatures rise, unlike ecosystems in other parts of the world. The researchers discovered a temperature increase of just 1 degree Celsius in near-surface air temperatures in the tropics leads to an average annual growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide equivalent to one-third of the annual global emissions from combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation combined. In tropical ecosystems carbon uptake is reduced at higher temperatures. This finding provides scientists with a key diagnostic tool to better understand the global carbon cycle. \"What we learned is that in spite of droughts, floods, volcano eruptions, El Niño and other events, the Earth system has been remarkably consistent in regulating the year-to-year variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,\" said Weile Wang, a research scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., and lead author of a paper published Wednesday, July 24, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study provides support for the \"carbon-climate feedback\" hypothesis proposed by many scientists. This hypothesis asserts a warming climate will lead to accelerated carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere from vegetation and soils. Multiple Earth system processes, such as droughts and floods, also contribute to changes in the atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate. The new finding demonstrates observed temperature changes are a more important factor than rainfall changes in the tropics. The team used a state-of-the-art, high-performance computing and data access facility called NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) at Ames to investigate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between carbon dioxide levels and increased temperatures.

    "content": "6 min read When you fill a sink, the water rises at the same rate to the same height in every corner. That's not the way it works with our rising seas. According to the 23-year record of satellite data from NASA and its partners, the sea level is rising a few millimeters a year — a fraction of an inch. If you live on the U.S. East Coast, though, your sea level is rising two or three times faster than average. If you live in Scandinavia, it's falling. Residents of China's Yellow River delta are swamped by sea level rise of more than nine inches (25 centimeters) a year. These regional differences in sea level change will become even more apparent in the future, as ice sheets melt. For instance, when the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is totally gone, the average global sea level will rise four feet. But the East Coast of the United States will see an additional 14 to 15 inches above that average. Tides, winds and ocean currents play a role in these regional differences, but an increasingly important mover and shaker is the solid Earth itself. Global warming is not just affecting the surface of our world; it's making the Earth move under our feet. Unless a volcano or earthquake is in the news, we tend to think of our home planet as solid rock. But 50 miles (80 kilometers) below our feet, there's a layer thousands of miles thick that can flow like a liquid over thousands of years. The tectonic plates of Earth's crust float on this viscous layer, called the mantle, like a vanilla wafer on a very thick pudding. If you were to put a strawberry on top of that vanilla wafer, the added weight would make the cookie sink into the pudding. In the same way, heavy weights on Earth's crust push it down into the mantle, which flows away and bulges out elsewhere. The miles-thick ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have been depressing the crust beneath them for millennia. That weight has a second effect that you won't see in your dessert: its gravitational pull on the surrounding ocean makes seawater pile up around the coastlines. These weight-filled dents in the mantle don't make a permanent scar. When the extra weight lifts, the mantle rebounds. This doesn't just happen at the majestic pace of mountain ranges crumbling. It happens every day. \"The solid earth can respond very quickly — nearly instantaneously,\" said Mark Tamisiea, a scientist at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, England, who studies the connection between sea levels and Earth processes. Tamisiea cited the example of solid-Earth tides, which pull the crust outward as much as a foot (30 centimeters) toward the moon as it passes overhead. Similarly, Earth has an instant initial response to glaciers and ice sheets melting, called the elastic response.

Credit: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Methane ‘hot spots’ in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta are more likely to be found where recent wildfires burned into the tundra, altering carbon emissions from the land. In Alaska’s largest river delta, tundra that has been scorched by wildfire is emitting more methane than the rest of the landscape long after the flames died, scientists have found. The potent greenhouse gas can originate from decomposing carbon stored in permafrost for thousands of years. Its release could accelerate climate warming and lead to more frequent wildfires in the tundra, where blazes have been historically rare. The new study was conducted by a team of scientists working as part of NASA’s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), a large-scale study of environmental change in Alaska and Western Canada. Researchers found that methane hot spots were roughly 29% more likely to occur in tundra that had been scorched by wildfire in the past 50 years compared to unburned areas. The correlation nearly tripled in areas where a fire burned to the edge of a lake, stream, or other standing-water body. The highest ratio of hot spots occurred in recently burned wetlands.

    "content": "4 min read A quarter to half of Earth’s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25. An international team of 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort, which involved using satellite data from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index, or amount of leaf cover, over the planet’s vegetated regions. The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States. Green leaves use energy from sunlight through photosynthesis to chemically combine carbon dioxide drawn in from the air with water and nutrients tapped from the ground to produce sugars, which are the main source of food, fiber and fuel for life on Earth. Studies have shown that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth. While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events. Carbon dioxide fertilization isn’t the only cause of the increased plant growth—nitrogen, land cover change and climate change by way of global temperature, precipitation and sunlight changes all contribute to the greening effect. To determine the extent of carbon dioxide’s contribution, researchers ran the data for carbon dioxide and each of the other variables in isolation through several computer models that mimic the plant growth observed in the satellite data. Results showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect, said co-author Ranga Myneni, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University. “The second most important driver is nitrogen, at 9 percent. So we see what an outsized role CO2 plays in this process.” About 85 percent of Earth’s ice-free lands is covered by vegetation. The area covered by all the green leaves on Earth is equal to, on average, 32 percent of Earth’s total surface area — oceans, lands and permanent ice sheets combined. The extent of the greening over the past 35 years “has the ability to fundamentally change the cycling of water and carbon in the climate system,” said lead author Zaichun Zhu, a researcher from Peking University, China, who did the first half of this study with Myneni as a visiting scholar at Boston University. Every year, about half of the 10 billion tons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere from human activities remains temporarily stored, in about equal parts, in the oceans and plants. “While our study did not address the connection between greening and carbon storage in plants, other studies have reported an increasing carbon sink on land since the",

    "content": "By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Earth Science News Team SMAP will monitor the frozen or thawed state of the global landscape north of 45 degrees north latitude. Credit: UCAR/Carlye Calvin Those who feel as though they've been living in the never-ending winter of the movie \"Frozen\" this year may be glad to hear that the spring thaw is now typically arriving up to two weeks earlier in the Northern Hemisphere than it did 20 to 30 years ago. But the changing date of the spring thaw has consequences far beyond reducing the number of mornings when you have to scrape off your windshield. One ecosystem where scientists would most like to understand the effects of changing freeze/thaw cycles is boreal forests, the great ring of green covering the land nearest the North Pole. The forests of Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia and Siberia cover almost 15 percent of Earth's land surface. The Arctic is warming more quickly than lower latitudes, and the way these forests respond to this rapid change could provide valuable clues about our planet's warmer future. But we know very little about how the boreal forests are changing. Millions of square miles have no roads or even villages. \"What we have now are very sparse, seasonal measurements from the ground,\" said John Kimball, a professor of systems ecology at the University of Montana, Missoula, and a member of the science team for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, launched Jan. 31. \"We do have long-term, global satellite data sets that are sensitive to freeze-thaw, but they tend to be very coarse.\" That means each measurement averages the status of a large area. Like a mosaic made of large tiles, these data cannot show much detail. That's about to change. By the end of April, SMAP will begin monitoring the frozen or thawed state of the landscape north of 45 degrees north latitude (about the latitude of Minneapolis) every two days. The primary mission of SMAP is to measure the amount of moisture in the top few inches of soil globally, but it also detects whether that moisture is frozen or in liquid form. SMAP's radar measurements, with \"tiles\" only half a mile to a mile and a half (1 to 3 kilometers) across, will reveal far more detail than scientists now have about the freeze/thaw status of the land surface. Why is greater detail needed? In the Arctic, the timing of the spring thaw can vary considerably within a small area. Because the returning sun is low on the horizon, the shadowed north side of a hill may remain icy many days after plants have started growing again on the sunlit south side. Those early spring weeks are critical in the short Arctic growing season. \"Once the vegetation thaws, boom! Photosynthesis takes off,\" Kimball explained. \"You can get your highest rates of photosynthesis within a few weeks after the thaw, and a later thaw can mean much lower vegetation growth for the season. We need observations at what I call the landscape level to more precisely monitor those patterns and changes.\" During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air. The carbon stays in their wood, roots and leaves, and when they die, most of it remains in the soil. That makes undisturbed forests what scientists call carbon sinks — places that remove carbon from the atmosphere. Longer unfrozen seasons in the Arctic give forests more time to grow and spread, increasing the extent of the carbon sink. On the other hand, climate warming has increased the occurrence of droughts and wildfires in the Arctic. A burning forest spews enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere; in scientific terms, it is a carbon source. Thus, global climate change is causing the northern forests both to absorb and to release more carbon. With so little Arctic data to crunch, models of Arctic land processes do not agree on which of these trends is prevailing, much less what the future could hold. Lack of consensus does not indicate fundamental disagreements on the physical processes involved, according to JPL scientist Josh Fisher, a member of the SMAP algorithm team. The problem is that, at present, if you put the Arctic's emitted carbon on one side of a scale and absorbed carbon on the other, the scales would almost balance. \"The source/sink balance is usually close to zero, and it's very easy to get on the wrong side of the zero,\" he said. Yet the wrong answer on this fundamental question can cascade into a chain of wrong answers in the course of a model simulation. SMAP's fine-scale observations have the potential to improve modelers' understanding of both today's situation and how it may change in the future. This spring, SMAP will spin up in time to track the spring thaw in the boreal forest with the detail scientists need — as Princess Anna in \"Frozen\" says, \"For the first time in forever.\" For more about SMAP, visit: http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/ Fast facts SMAP will measure whether northern forests are frozen or thawed.

    "content": "By Dr. Michael Puma, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center The \"butterfly effect,\" a term coined by the late Edward Lorenz, is a phenomenon familiar to many of us. The idea is that in a chaotic system, a small change like a butterfly flapping its wings in some distant part of the globe can influence a large-scale effect, such as the formation and trajectory of a storm like the recent Hurricane Sandy. In light of the tremendous consequences that can result from such trivial changes, climate modelers now recognize that it is not possible to simulate our climate system perfectly and have devised various approaches to deal with this phenomenon. Yet, if we look at recent efforts by the climate simulation community to construct comprehensive Earth System Models, perhaps this question is not so ridiculous after all. In fact, due to inclusion of more detailed representations of biological, physical, and chemical processes, model complexity has increased dramatically in recent years. Small-scale, seemingly trivial processes such as soil microbial activity and aerosols from consumer products are now standard features of many climate models. The rationale, of course, is that these processes are essential for realistic simulation of some aspect of our climate system. In a new paper, we explored the importance of one new feature that adds complexity to state-of-the-art climate models: simulation of year-to-year variations in the emergence and loss of leaves by trees and other plants, or \"dynamic phenology\". These interannual leaf variations are typically represented within the dynamic global vegetation model of a climate model. We asked the question: How important are these predictions of leaf variation for a climate model, assuming that they can be simulated accurately in the first place? We found in our analyses that, for such things as evapotranspiration and runoff, year-to-year leaf variations are less important than year-to-year variations in meteorology. Because poor simulation of meteorological variables is common in climate models, a determination that meteorological variability is more important for certain variables than leaf variability may point to meteorological bias correction as a more fruitful development path — for certain model applications — than the development of a dynamic phenological routine. We might be tempted to simply include dynamic phenology in a climate model for all applications (again, assuming we can realistically simulate leaf variations). More generally, we might promote climate models that are as complex or comprehensive as possible, reasoning that such models would be our best tools for understanding climate. However, we should be cautious about going down such a path. One challenge of additional complexity, recently highlighted by a land-model intercomparison study, is that predictions are diverging as models have become more complex, rather than converging as was hoped. The complexity also impedes efforts to understand the reasons for differences among predictions and the associated mechanisms. A more practical reason to be cautious is the limited financial, time, and computing resources available to the scientific community. We must be more strategic about which processes we include and avoid being driven by model envy (i.e., believing a certain model is the best, because it includes the greatest level of detail). Our paper and others like it are critically needed as we work with limited resources to improve the skill of our climate models. If a published paper one day promotes a climate model that represents the moth interacting with leaves as they emerge in the springtime, we will know that our model-development efforts have gone astray.

Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on Thursday, March 26 commanded SMAP's spun instrument assembly – the part of the observatory that spins – to increase its rotation speed from the initial rate of 5 revolutions per minute achieved on March 23 to its final science measurement rate of 14.6 revolutions per minute. Throughout the gradual process, which took approximately 80 minutes, onboard guidance, navigation and control software managed the spin-up acceleration level, allowing the spacecraft to maintain its Earth-pointing (nadir) attitude. Initial data indicate the antenna spin-up procedure went as planned. Mission controllers will now analyze the spin-up process and the stability of the observatory at its final spin rate. Next week, mission controllers are scheduled to again power on SMAP’s two soil moisture measuring instruments to complete their checkout with the rotating antenna. The rotating antenna enables true global coverage every two to three days by generating a 620-mile-wide (1,000-kilometer) swath of the ground as it flies above Earth at an altitude of 426 miles (685 kilometers). SMAP remains on track to complete its initial checkout and commissioning activities by the end of April. After that, scientists will begin calibrating and validating SMAP’s data products to ensure they meet the stringent accuracy and data quality requirements NASA has established for the mission. This process is expected to take up to 15 months to complete; however, initial data products with a preliminary level of calibration will be released by August",

    "content": "3 min read Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, NASA and other research organizations have discovered two seafloor troughs that could allow warm ocean water to reach the base of Totten Glacier, East Antarctica's largest and most rapidly thinning glacier. The discovery likely explains the glacier's extreme thinning and raises concern about its impact on sea level rise. The result, published in the journal Nature Geoscience today, March 16, has global implications because the ice flowing through Totten Glacier alone is equivalent to the entire volume of the more widely studied West Antarctic Ice Sheet. If Totten Glacier were to collapse completely, global sea levels would rise by at least 11 feet (3.3 meters). As in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, complete collapse of Totten Glacier may take centuries, although the timing of retreat in both places is the subject of intensive research. East Antarctica has appeared to be stable compared with the rapidly melting western side of the continent. The new finding shows that \"Totten Glacier and the East Antarctic Ice Sheet are a much more interesting and dynamic part of the sea level rise story than we'd previously thought,\" said co-author Dustin Schroeder, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. Schroeder helped analyze data from an ice-penetrating radar to demonstrate that ocean water could access the glacier through the newfound troughs. In some areas of the ocean surrounding Antarctica, warm water can be found below cooler water because it is saltier, and therefore heavier, than the shallower water. Seafloor valleys that connect this deep warm water to the coast can especially compromise glaciers, but this process had previously been seen only under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Deep warm water had been observed seaward of Totten Glacier, but there was no evidence that it could compromise coastal ice. The newly discovered troughs are deep enough to give the deep warm water access to the huge cavity under the glacier. The deeper of the two troughs extends from the ocean to the underside of Totten Glacier in an area not previously known to be floating. The data for this study were gathered as part of the International Collaboration for Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling (ICECAP) project, which, together with the East Antarctic component of NASA's Operation IceBridge mission, made the first comprehensive survey of the Totten Glacier Ice Shelf and nearby regions between",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech. View larger image. Mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, have commanded the 20-foot (6-meter) reflector antenna on NASA's new Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory to begin spinning for the first time. The partial spin-up is a key step in commissioning the satellite in preparation for science operations. Last week, mission controllers sent commands to release the locking mechanism that prevented the observatory's spun instrument assembly –- the part that spins — from rotating during launch and deployment of the reflector. The spun instrument assembly includes the spin control electronics, radiometer instrument and reflector antenna. Yesterday, in the first step of a two-step procedure, the spun instrument assembly was spun up to its initial rate of five revolutions per minute (rpm), a process that took about a minute. Initial data indicate the partial antenna spin-up procedure went as planned. Because of the large size (mass) of the spun instrument assembly and its relatively rapid angular acceleration during spin-up, SMAP's spacecraft bus rotated in the opposite direction during this process to balance the angular momentum. It reached a peak rate of up to 11 degrees per second. Once the spun instrument assembly spin rate stabilized at five rpm, the spacecraft’s reaction wheels quickly restored the spacecraft bus to a non-rotating, stable attitude. Onboard flight software then turned the observatory back to its science-gathering orientation, with the spin axis pointing straight down to the ground and SMAP's solar array pointed toward the sun. The observatory will remain in its current configuration with the spun instrument assembly rotating at five rpm for about three days to allow ground controllers to assess the observatory's performance at this spin rate before proceeding to the next step. On March 26, after ground analysis of this first antenna spin-up step is completed, mission controllers plan to increase the antenna's spin speed to its final rate of approximately 15 rpm. The partial antenna spin-up follows a series of recent propulsive maneuvers by SMAP's ground flight operations team to adjust the observatory to its final science orbit for mapping operations. SMAP launched Jan. 31 on a minimum three-year mission to map global soil moisture and detect whether soils are frozen or thawed. The mission will help scientists understand the links in Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles; help reduce uncertainties in predicting weather and climate; and enhance our ability to monitor and predict natural hazards such as floods and droughts When fully spun up and collecting science data, SMAP's antenna will measure a 620-mile-wide (1,000-kilometer) swath of the ground as it flies above Earth at an altitude of 426 miles (685 kilometers). This will allow SMAP to map the entire globe with high-resolution radar data every two to three days.

NAAMES, or the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study, is a five-year NASA-funded study that aims to define that relationship better. NAAMES is the first NASA Earth Venture-Suborbital mission focused on studying the coupled ocean ecosystem and atmosphere using ships and aircraft simultaneously. Plankton ecosystems of the global ocean profoundly affect climate and life on Earth. NASA's ocean color satellite record tells us that these invaluable ecosystems are highly responsive to climate variability, with changes in ocean plankton production impacting food (e.g., fish), uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the ocean, and ocean emission of climate-regulating aerosols. During the field campaign, NASA satellites provide a larger view of ocean processes. In fact, satellite data caused NAAMES ocean and atmospheric scientists to question current thinking on what forces control plankton blooms and how those factors could impact the atmosphere and the climate. “Satellite data can be used to calculate the total photosynthesis that goes on in the ocean every year,” said Mike Behrenfeld, NAAMES principal investigator. “It’s essentially equivalent to the total photosynthesis that’s happening on land.” The interdisciplinary ocean and atmospheric science questions of NAAMES parallel those of upcoming NASA satellite missions, such as PACE (Pre-Aerosol, Clouds, and ocean Ecosystem). Comparisons of ship-based measurements to the airborne measurements also provide valuable information for scientists to develop and test analytical tools to use with these future satellite data.

    "content": "By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Earth Science News Team PRISM was designed to focus on hard-to-see phenomena in difficult coastal light conditions. Credit: Flickr user Ken Lund, CC BY-SA 2.0. A coastal scene with deep blue seas and a coral reef is beautiful to look at, but if you try to record the scene with a camera or a scientific instrument, the results are almost always disappointing. Most cameras can't \"see\" underwater objects in such scenes because they're so dim and wash out the glaring seashore. These problems don't just ruin vacation photos. They're a serious hindrance for scientists who need images of the coastline to study how these ecosystems are being affected by climate change, development and other hazards. To the rescue: the new Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer, created at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. PRISM is an airborne instrument designed to observe hard-to-see coastal water phenomena. In NASA's upcoming Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory (CORAL) field experiment, PRISM will observe entire reef ecosystems in more of the world's reef area – hundreds of times more — than has ever been observed before. \"Coastal ocean science has specific requirements that had not been met with other instruments\" when PRISM was initially proposed, said Pantazis Mouroulis of JPL, who designed the instrument. \"At that time, it was not even known whether anyone could design an instrument with those characteristics. We had to devise new techniques for assembling and aligning the instrument, and even new technologies for the components.\" With devastating coral bleaching taking place around the world, a sensor that can collect a detailed, uniform, large-scale dataset on coral reefs could hardly be more timely. \"The value of doing this investigation right now is unimaginable because of the speed at which the environment is changing, and PRISM is the perfect instrument at the perfect time,\" said JPL's David Thompson, who with Bo-Cai Gao, Zhongping Lee and the CORAL science team is designing a computer model to use with PRISM's measurements for CORAL. \"It's such a sensitive instrument — beyond anything I've worked with before.\" PRISM is a spectrometer, an instrument that splits light into its spectrum of wavelengths and measures the intensity of the light at each individual wavelength. Every type of molecule absorbs a unique combination of wavelengths, leaving dark gaps in the spectrum of light. The pattern of gaps is a sort of spectral \"bar code\" for that molecule. Spectrometers collect light and record these spectral patterns in it. PRISM's spectrometer collects spectra in the visible, ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths, which encompass the \"bar codes\" for most phenomena of interest along coastlines. Because it is an airborne instrument, PRISM can measure wide swaths of coastline repeatedly in a short period of time — important when monitoring rapidly changing conditions such as rising floodwaters — and it creates a dataset on a regional scale, but with an amount of detail approaching what can be collected by boat-based campaigns. Boat campaigns can only produce local-scale datasets, because they are so expensive and labor intensive. PRISM measures all spectra in the entire scene below its airborne perch. Each airborne campaign that uses the instrument can select just the spectra it needs for its area of study. For the CORAL campaign, \"We're after that fraction of light that makes it all the way to the bottom of the ocean and comes back to the sensor, which carries the signal of the health of the coral reef,\" said Thompson. Thompson designed his computer algorithms to eliminate the unneeded light and isolate just the seafloor spectra. \"You can think of it as peeling back the layers of an onion,\" he said. \"Atmospheric haze is different from the surface glint off the ocean, which is different from light that's gone partway down into the ocean, which is different from light that's gone all the way down [to the seafloor and back]. All those other optical paths have to be eliminated in our modeling.\" To test Thompson's model, the light from each \"onion layer\" is compared against measurements of the same thing — the amount of atmospheric haze and the light-changing properties of the ocean water, for example — taken aboard boats at a few points along the plane's path at the same time the instrument flies overhead. \"It's critical for the math [in the model] to be tied down at different points with actual, physical measurements,\" Thompson said. When a shipboard measurement of the water's murkiness agrees with the model's calculation of the same thing, for example, it gives confidence that the model is correctly interpreting the spectra collected by PRISM. Heidi Dierssen, an oceanographer and professor at the University of Connecticut, Groton, and co-investigator in the CORAL campaign, worked on the development of PRISM and took the instrument on its first field campaign to study eelgrass in California's coastal waters. Dierssen has used many different instruments to gather coastal data in the past. When she used sensors that were optimized for land to observe the ocean, \"They failed to give us good signals,\" she said. \"When you looked at a spectrum it was often wavy, and you had to spend a lot of effort to calibrate it to what you measured in the water.\" When she used PRISM, \"I was shocked,\" she said. \"The first time we collected imagery, we got very good agreement with the field data. That instrument is truly a leap forward.\" CORAL's project scientist, Michelle Gierach of JPL, has seen PRISM's data from Dierssen's study and used the instrument to observe ocean color (which can indicate phytoplankton presence) in the sea around Antarctica last winter. \"We have only begun to scratch the surface of what PRISM is capable of doing, from eelgrass to biology within the Southern Ocean to now assessing coral reefs throughout the western tropical Pacific,\" she said. \"Those are just some of the things that PRISM has in its arsenal. There's so much more that is possible.\" For more information about NASA's Earth science activities, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/earth Alan Buis Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California 818-354-",

    "content": "10 Interesting Things About Water There aren’t many qualities that are true of all life on Earth, but the need for water is one of them. It’s in all living things, whether they live at the bottom of the ocean or the driest desert. Water made life possible on Earth. Because of this, astrobiologists (scientists who search for life on other planets) think our best bet for finding life is to search for water. A whopping 96.5 percent of water on Earth is in our oceans, covering 71 percent of the surface of our planet. And at any given time, about 0.001 percent is floating above us in the atmosphere. If all of that water fell as rain at once, the whole planet would get about 1 inch of rain. Just 3.5 percent of Earth’s water is fresh—that is, with few salts in it. You can find Earth’s freshwater in our lakes, rivers, and streams, but don’t forget groundwater and glaciers. Over 68 percent of Earth’s freshwater is locked up in ice and glaciers. And another 30 percent is in groundwater. In a gallon of average ocean water, there is about 1 cup of salt. But it does vary. The Atlantic Ocean is saltier than the Pacific Ocean, for instance. Most of the salt in the ocean is the same kind of salt we put on our food: sodium chloride. The saltiest water in the world is found in Antarctica in a small lake named Don Juan Pond. There can be a lot going on in a single drop of ocean water. It will most likely have millions (yes, millions!) of bacteria and viruses. And it could also have fish eggs, baby crabs, plankton, or even small worms. The rocky material that formed Earth contained some water. But that probably doesn't account for all the water we see today. Comets are mostly water ice. It’s possible that comets made regular water deliveries to Earth. It would take a lot of comets to fill the ocean, but comets could well have made a big contribution. Usually when solids form, atoms get closer together to form something denser. This is why most solids sink in water. But solid water, or ice, is actually less dense. This is unusual. The water molecules form rings when water freezes. All that space makes ice less dense. This is why it floats. This is great because ice floating on top of a body of water lets the rest of it stay liquid. If ice sank, whole oceans could freeze solid! A newborn baby is 78 percent water. Adults are 55-60 percent water. Water is involved in just about everything our body does. It’s a big part of the blood that brings nutrients to all our cells. We use it to get rid of wastes. It helps us regulate our body temperature. It acts as a shock absorber for our brain and spinal cord. We are very dependent on water. Water has an interesting characteristic. It’s sort of “sticky.” It likes to stick to itself and other things. That’s why water forms round droplets. Not all liquids do that. This “stickiness” helps get water from the roots of plants up to the leaves. Water molecules travel up thin straws called xylem in the plant by holding onto each other and the walls of the tube. They’re pulled upwards as water evaporates from the leaves at the top. We experience water in all three states: solid ice, liquid water, and gas water vapor. That’s actually pretty unusual. While all substances can be solid, liquid, or gas, a lot of them only change states at extreme temperatures. You probably don’t see liquid silver or solid oxygen very much because their melting points and freezing points are at temperatures that would kill us.

    "content": "From NASA Ocean currents and winds form an endless feedback loop: winds blow over the ocean's surface, creating currents there. At the same time, the hot or cold water in these currents influences the wind's speed. This delicate dance is crucial to understanding Earth's changing climate. Gathering data on this interaction can also help people track oil spills, plan shipping routes and understand ocean productivity in relation to fisheries. Instruments already exist that measure ocean currents, and others that measure wind, such as NASA's QuickScat and RapidScat. But a new, airborne radar instrument developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is able to measure both. Called DopplerScatt, the instrument is a spinning radar that \"pings\" the ocean's surface, allowing it to take measurements from multiple directions at once. It's a step up from previous technology, which could simultaneously measure current from one or two directions at the most, and couldn't measure properties of the sea surface as completely as this new instrument. These measurements would make DopplerScat a valuable addition to future satellite missions, said Ernesto Rodriguez, science lead for the instrument at JPL. \"DopplerScatt gives us unprecedented simultaneous observation of wind and currents,\" Rodriguez said. \"Because it combines observations of the surface over a wide swath, we can now take a high-resolution snapshot of the interacting ocean and atmosphere unavailable from previous instruments.\" DopplerScatt was developed at JPL with funding from NASA's Earth Science Technology Office. As with a highway patrolman's speed gun, it calculates the Doppler effect of a radar signal bouncing off an object. As that object moves closer or farther away, it detects these changes and figures out its speed and trajectory. Those measurements are combined with data from a scatterometer, which detects the reflection of the radar signal from the ocean's surface. The more \"scattering\" the radar observes, the rougher the waves. From the roughness and orientation of the waves, wind speed and direction can be calculated.

    "content": "From NASA The Gulfstream III carrying NASA's PRISM instrument being readied for science flights from Cairns, Australia. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/BIOS. A NASA airborne mission designed to transform our understanding of Earth's valuable and ecologically sensitive coral reefs has set up shop in Australia for a two-month investigation of the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef ecosystem. At a media briefing today at Cairns Airport in North Queensland, Australia, scientists from NASA's COral Reef Airborne Laboratory (CORAL) mission and their Australian collaborators discussed the mission's objectives and the new insights they expect to glean into the present condition of the Great Barrier Reef and the function of reef systems worldwide. \"CORAL offers the clearest, most extensive picture to date of the condition of a large portion of the world's coral reefs,\" said CORAL Principal Investigator Eric Hochberg of the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), Ferry Reach, St. George's, Bermuda, prior to the briefing. \"This new understanding of reef condition and function will allow scientists to better predict the future of this global ecosystem and provide policymakers with better information for decisions regarding resource management.\" CORAL's three-year mission combines aerial surveys using state-of-the-art airborne imaging spectrometer technology developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, with in-water validation activities. The mission will provide critical data and new models for analyzing reef ecosystems from a new perspective. CORAL will generate a uniform data set for a large sample of reefs across the Pacific Ocean. Scientists can use these data to search for trends between coral reef condition and the natural and human-produced biological and environmental factors that affect reefs. Over the next year, CORAL will survey portions of the Great Barrier Reef, along with reef systems in the main Hawaiian Islands, the Mariana Islands and Palau. In Australia, CORAL will survey six discrete sections across the length of the Great Barrier Reef, from the Capricorn-Bunker Group in the south to Torres Strait in the north. Two locations on the reef — one north (Lizard Island Research Station) and one south (Heron Island Research Station) — will serve as bases for in-water validation activities. Scientists from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the University of Queensland in Brisbane are collaborating with NASA and BIOS to conduct additional complementary in-water validation activities. Located in the Coral Sea off Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef encompasses more than 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. It is more than 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) long and covers an area of about 133,000 square miles (344,400 square kilometers). The largest single structure made by living organisms on Earth, the reef teems with biodiversity, including about 400 species of coral. It attracts about 2 million visitors a year; in turn, tourism and fishing generate billions annually and employ tens of thousands of people. However, the reef faces environmental pressures from various human and climate change impacts. \"The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's national treasure, so having a broader understanding of its condition and what's threatening it will help us better understand how we can protect it,\" said Tim Malthus, research leader of CSIRO's Coastal Monitoring, Modeling and Informatics Group in Canberra, Australia. \"Along with surveying several large sections of the reef, CORAL will also survey the health of corals in the Torres Strait, a complex high-tide area that has been historically less studied. It is also opportunistic for us to see if the reef is recovering after the recent bleaching event.\" Stuart Phinn, professor of geography at the University of Queensland (UQ), said CORAL will provide Australian coral reef science and management with unique new maps and mapping approaches. These will expand ongoing efforts to map and understand Great Barrier Reef dynamics. \"Being able to support and collaborate on NASA's CORAL project will enable groups like ours to advance our capabilities and transfer them to Australian science and management agencies,\" Phinn said. \"Part of this includes building a process for mapping the entire reef. UQ and CORAL will exchange field data, knowledge and experience to cross-validate mapping and monitoring approaches.\" Around the world, concerns among scientists, resource managers and the public that coral reef ecosystems are degrading at alarming rates due to human-induced factors and global change have motivated increased assessment and monitoring efforts. The urgency of the problem has forced estimates of global reef status to be synthesized from a variety of local surveys with disparate aims, methods and quality. The problem with current assessments of reef degradation, said Hochberg, is that the data supporting these predictions are not uniform and surprisingly sparse. \"Virtually all reef assessments to date rely on in-water survey techniques that are laborious, expensive and limited in spatial scope,\" he said. \"Very little of Earth's reef area has been directly surveyed. More importantly, there are no existing models that quantitatively relate reef conditions to the full range of biological and environmental factors that affect them -- models that can help scientists better understand how coral reefs will respond to expected environmental changes. CORAL addresses an urgent need in the face of ongoing worldwide reef degradation, and also serves as a pathfinder for a future satellite mission to globally survey the world's reefs.\" Natural, balanced coral reefs comprise mosaics of coral, algae and sand on the seafloor that, together, drive the structure and function of reef ecosystems. When corals die, algae rapidly take over their skeletons. A non-stressed, healthy reef will usually increase coral coverage as it recovers from disturbance. But when a stressed reef is disturbed, the carbonate structure of its coral erodes, and the reef ultimately becomes a flat-bottom community dominated by algae, shifting rubble and sand, with little to no coral recovery. Such ecosystem phase shifts, as they are called, represent a radical change in a reef's character, marked by a decline in the diversity of reef flora and fauna. CORAL will generate scientific data products describing coral reef condition, measuring three key components of reef health for which we currently have limited data: composition, primary productivity and calcification. Primary productivity is a measure of how much energy is available to drive biological activity in a reef system. Calcification measures the net gain in carbonates, which determine a reef's long-term growth. To accomplish its science objectives, CORAL will use JPL's Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM). PRISM will literally peer through the ocean's surface to generate high-resolution images of reflected light in the specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum important to coral reef scientists. Mounted in the belly of a modified Tempus Solutions Gulfstream IV aircraft, PRISM will survey reefs from an altitude of 28,000 feet (8,500 meters) to generate calibrated scientific data products. \"PRISM builds on an extensive legacy of JPL spectrometers that have successfully operated for NASA and non-NASA missions,\" said Michelle Gierach, NASA CORAL project scientist at JPL. \"It provides the coral reef science community with high-quality oceanographic imagery at the accuracy, range, resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, sensitivity and uniformity needed to answer key questions about coral reef condition. PRISM data will be analyzed against data for 10 key biological and environmental factors affecting coral reef ecosystems, acquired from pre-existing data sources.\" NASA collects data from space, air, land and sea to increase our understanding of our home planet, improve lives and safeguard our future.

A new study by University of Washington researchers, funded by NASA and using satellite data from NASA and other agencies, found a trend toward earlier sea ice melt in the spring and later ice growth in the fall across all 19 polar bear subpopulations, which can negatively impact the feeding and breeding capabilities of the bears. The paper, published on Sept. 14 in the journal The Cryosphere, is the first to quantify the sea ice changes in each polar bear subpopulation across the entire Arctic region using metrics that are specifically relevant to polar bear biology. \"This study shows declining sea ice for all subpopulations of polar bears,\" said co-author Harry Stern, a researcher with the University of Washington's Polar Science Center in Seattle. The analysis shows that the critical timing of the sea ice break-up and sea ice freeze-up is changing in all areas in a direction that is harmful for polar bears. “Other researchers have used the satellite-derived sea ice data to look at how the sea ice extent in a particular place is changing in a particular month. But for us the important thing was the timing of the retreat of sea ice in the spring and its advance in the fall, for all 19 polar bear subpopulations,” Stern said. Nineteen separate polar bear subpopulations live throughout the Arctic, spending their winters and springs roaming on sea ice and hunting. The bears have evolved mainly to eat seals, which provide necessary fats and nutrients in the harsh Arctic environment. Polar bears can't outswim their prey, so instead they perch on the ice as a platform and ambush seals at breathing holes or break through the ice to access their dens. \"Sea ice really is their platform for life,\" said co-author Kristin Laidre, a researcher at the UW's Polar Science Center. \"They are capable of existing on land for part of the year, but the sea ice is where they obtain their main prey.\" The new study draws upon 35 years of satellite data showing sea ice concentration each day in the Arctic. NASA scientists process the data, stored at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. The center also reports each fall the yearly minimum low for Arctic sea ice. This August saw the fourth lowest in the satellite record and the September minimum extent is likely headed to its second lowest level in the record. In 17 of the 19 polar bear subpopulations, the researchers found that the total number of ice-covered days declined at the rate of seven to 19 days per decade between",

During a 9 a.m. PST (noon EST) media teleconference today, NASA and university scientists will discuss new insights, tools and agency research into key carbon and climate change questions, as the agency ramps up its efforts to understand how Earth’s ocean, forest, and land ecosystems absorb nearly half of emitted carbon dioxide today. Carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by human activities influences the amount of the sun’s energy trapped by Earth’s atmosphere. These emissions are the subject of a United Nations climate conference in Paris later this month. To improve the information available to policymakers on this issue, scientists are grappling with the complex question of whether Earth’s oceans, forests and land ecosystems will maintain their capacity to absorb about half of all human-produced carbon dioxide emissions in the future. “NASA is at the forefront of scientific understanding in this area, bringing together advanced measurement technologies, focused field experiments, and cutting-edge research to reveal how carbon moves around the planet and changes our climate,” said Michael Freilich, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division. “Understanding how the planet responds to human carbon emissions and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels will position our nation to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges that climate changes present.” Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels recently surpassed a concentration of 400 parts per million (ppm) — higher than at any time in at least 400,000 years — and continue to increase at about 2 ppm per year. Levels of the even more potent heat-trapping gas methane — also carbon-based — now exceed pre-industrial amounts by about 2.5 times. Calculations show that, on average, only about half of the carbon emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere. This “other half” of the carbon problem — how and where it is absorbed on land and sea — is a priority for carbon cycle scientists at NASA and around the world. Scientists are investigating how Earth’s warming environment will affect the ability of ecosystems around the world to absorb carbon naturally, and what changes in those ecosystems could mean for future climate. It’s a major research question involving several NASA satellite missions, multi-year field campaigns and new instruments that will fly on the International Space Station in coming years. Scientists discussed the ongoing analysis of the first year-plus of satellite data from NASA’s recently launched Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 — the agency’s first satellite designed to measure carbon dioxide from the top of Earth’s atmosphere to its surface. “As carbon dioxide is the largest human-produced driver of our changing climate, having regular observations from space is a major step forward for our ability to understand and predict climate change,” said Annmarie Eldering, OCO-2 deputy project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. “Precisely measuring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been one of the most difficult observations to make from space.” OCO-2 already is demonstrating the accuracy, precision and coverage needed to provide the first complete picture of both human and natural sources of carbon dioxide and the places where they are being absorbed. While the mission gives scientists new, near-global data on atmospheric carbon dioxide, satellite data cannot directly observe the processes by which the gas is absorbed on the land and ocean. To better understand these processes, NASA scientists will use satellite data and detailed field experiments in concert with super-high-resolution computer models. Scientists need this integrated approach in order to continue to more accurately predict how carbon-absorbing ecosystems will respond to a warming climate. \"The land and the ocean are really doing us a big favor,\" said Lesley Ott, an atmospheric scientist in the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Otherwise you would have carbon building up in the atmosphere twice as fast as it does now.\" Also causing concern is the potential for the ocean’s rate of carbon absorption to change as ocean temperatures rise and phytoplankton communities show signs of change. NASA’s North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) launched ship and airborne studies last week to the North Atlantic Ocean, where satellites have documented surprising phytoplankton behavior in recent years. “We will be studying an ocean region that every year exhibits one of the largest natural phytoplankton blooms on Earth,” said Mike Behrenfeld, NAAMES principal investigator from Oregon State University in Corvallis. “Phytoplankton are not only influenced by climate, but they also influence climate. That’s why we’re out here in the North Atlantic in the middle of November.” Forest and other land ecosystems are also changing in response to a warmer world. Some ecosystems — such as thawing permafrost in the Arctic and fire-prone forests — could begin emitting more carbon than they currently absorb. Next fall, NASA’s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment will begin a 10-year investigation into the fate of carbon stores in rapidly warming regions of Alaska and Canada. The scientists also outlined several other upcoming NASA carbon missions and field campaigns, including: To learn more about NASA’s efforts to better understand the carbon and climate challenge, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/carbonclimate Scientific tools, information and expertise to help people manage their climate-related risks and opportunities, and improve their resilience to extreme events.

    "content": "From NASA A pristine reef in American Samoa. Credit: NOAA/NMFS/PIFSC/CRED, Oceanography Team. NASA's new COral Reef Airborne Laboratory (CORAL) field campaign kicks off its data-gathering phase with an operational readiness test on Oahu, Hawaii, starting the week of June 6. Over the next year, CORAL will conduct airborne and in-water surveys of representative coral reefs from Hawaii to Australia. By focusing on entire reef ecosystems, CORAL scientists will get state-of-the-art insights into how biological, physical and chemical processes shape and affect the ecosystems. These data will help them answer fundamental questions about how reefs are changing globally due to the effects of climate change and human activities. It uses a new NASA airborne instrument designed specifically to observe coastal environments. The Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) can see objects about five feet by five feet square (less than two meters by two meters square) from its airborne perch five miles (eight kilometers) overhead. PRISM will fly in a Gulfstream IV airplane, collecting large swaths of data that will allow scientists to distinguish among coral, algae and sand — important information for assessing reef condition — without having to go underwater in each location. This uniform dataset will be an advance over the current data, collected by multiple groups all using different techniques. Search online for \"coral reef images\" and you'll get a million spectacular photos, but they all show just the small fraction of the world's reef area that scuba divers have visited. The fraction that has been scientifically surveyed is even smaller. We simply don't have enough data to understand which impacts to reefs are the most damaging and how resilient reefs are likely to be. For decades, scuba diving has been the gold standard for conducting reef research, allowing scientists to study everything from coral reproduction to the complex relationships between coral and other organisms. However, scuba diving as a method of understanding entire ecosystems leaves a lot to be desired: it is time consuming, labor intensive and costly. CORAL's use of remote sensing technology to survey entire reef ecosystems represents a huge step forward in research capacity. Hard corals have outlived dinosaurs, existing on Earth since the mid-Triassic period, 200-250 million years ago. During this time, they’ve evolved and diversified to exist across the world’s ocean. Reef building corals typically occupy shallow tropical and subtropical waters; however, deep-water corals can be found at depths up to 20,000 feet (6,000 meters), and coral reefs were recently discovered at the mouth of the Amazon River in turbid, muddy water. Coral reef ecosystems play a vital role in maintaining Earth’s marine biodiversity and are also valuable to humans as a source of food, medical advances and tourism revenue, with total global ecosystem goods and services estimated at $400 billion each year. This number is especially impressive if you consider that the U.N. Environment Programme estimates that all the world's reefs would fit into an area smaller than the state of Arizona. A single coral polyp — consisting of the coral animal, its symbiotic algae and calcium carbonate skeleton — is usually less than half an inch (one centimeter) across. Unlike many animals, corals are colonial, which means that many polyps grow together and form a larger structure. Most corals that you see in aquaria are, in fact, colonies. A coral reef, on the other hand, is an entire ecosystem that includes the individual polyps and their colonies, plus other living (e.g., fish, worms, invertebrates, algae) and nonliving (e.g., sunlight, sand, water) components. Scientists have a pretty good understanding of how individual coral polyps and colonies function, but much less understanding of how the various parts of a reef act individually and collectively to form an ecosystem. CORAL is the first opportunity to study reefs at the ecosystem scale, rather than relying on patchy, inconsistent surveys.

For more than three decades NASA has focused its space-faring skills and science chops CSI-like on an elusive global killer. Later this month, that pursuit takes us to East Asia. In a few years, part way to the moon. We are getting close. Air pollution causes an estimated 152,000 deaths a year across the Americas and more than 2 million deaths in the Western Pacific, according to the United Nations. Some parts of the world have a detailed view of local air quality from ground sensor networks and forecast models that generate public alerts.

Spacecraft orbiting Earth hundreds or thousands of miles away with instruments to track pollutants – the way weather satellites watch clouds and storms – could benefit people worldwide.

    "content": "7 min read With its antenna now spinning at full speed, NASA's new Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory has successfully re-tested its science instruments and generated its first global maps, a key step to beginning routine science operations next month. SMAP launched Jan. 31 on a minimum three-year mission to map global soil moisture and detect whether soils are frozen or thawed. The mission will help scientists understand the links among Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles; help reduce uncertainties in predicting weather and climate; and enhance our ability to monitor and predict natural hazards such as floods and droughts. In late March, mission controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, successfully spun SMAP's 20-foot-wide (6-meter) antenna up to its full speed of 14.6 revolutions per minute in a two-step process. SMAP's spinning antenna makes cone-shaped scans across Earth’s surface, measuring a 620-mile-wide (1,000-kilometer) swath of the ground as it flies above Earth from pole to pole at an altitude of 426 miles (685 kilometers). The wide swath width and polar orbit allow SMAP to map the entire globe with high-resolution radar data every two to three days. With its spin-up activities complete, the observatory's radar and radiometer instruments were powered on from March 31 to April 3 in a test designed to verify the pointing accuracy of the antenna and the overall performance of the radar and radiometer instruments. The radar data acquired from the test have been processed to generate data products with a spatial resolution of about 19 miles (30 kilometers). The first full global maps produced during the test are online at: SMAP's radar, operating at 1.2 gigahertz, works by transmitting microwave pulses to the ground and receiving and measuring the strength of the signals that bounce back from Earth, called backscatter. Water — including water in soil — responds differently than dry soil does to microwaves. Water changes the strength of backscatter and microwaves’ polarization (the orientation of the electrical field of the microwaves). Therefore, backscatter from soil containing more moisture is stronger and is polarized differently than backscatter from drier soil. The extent of this difference allows scientists to distinguish the amount of moisture present in the soil. SMAP’s radar emits pulses with two different polarizations, horizontal and vertical, to make a more complete measurement of this effect. Like the radar, SMAP’s radiometer detects differences in microwaves caused by water in soil; but it measures Earth’s natural microwave emissions at the frequency of 1.4 gigahertz. Around the globe, the most striking difference in these natural emissions is between water and land surfaces. A desert emits microwaves at about three times the rate a lake does. Because the difference is so large, even a small amount of moisture in soil causes a change that a radiometer can measure accurately.

Launched Jan. 31 on a minimum three-year mission, SMAP will help scientists understand links among Earth's water, energy and carbon cycles; reduce uncertainties in predicting climate; and enhance our ability to monitor and predict natural hazards like floods and droughts. SMAP data have additional practical applications, including improved weather forecasting and crop yield predictions. During SMAP's first three months in orbit, referred to as SMAP's \"commissioning\" phase, the observatory was first exposed to the space environment, its solar array and reflector boom assembly containing SMAP's 20-foot (6-meter) reflector antenna were deployed, and the antenna and instruments were spun up to their full speed, enabling global measurements every two to three days. The commissioning phase also was used to ensure that SMAP science data reliably flow from its instruments to science data processing facilities at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, and the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Fourteen years after the concept for a NASA mission to map global soil moisture was first proposed, SMAP now has formally transitioned to routine science operations,\" said Kent Kellogg, SMAP project manager at JPL. \"SMAP's science team can now begin the important task of calibrating the observatory's science data products to ensure SMAP is meeting its requirements for measurement accuracy.\" Together, SMAP's two instruments, which share a common antenna, produce the highest-resolution, most accurate soil moisture maps ever obtained from space. The spacecraft’s radar transmits microwave pulses to the ground and measures the strength of the signals that bounce back from Earth, whereas its radiometer measures microwaves that are naturally emitted from Earth’s surface. \"SMAP data will eventually reveal how soil moisture conditions are changing over time in response to climate and how this impacts regional water availability,” said Dara Entekhabi, SMAP science team leader at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. “SMAP data will be combined with data from other missions like NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement, Aquarius and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment to reveal deeper insights into how the water cycle is evolving at global and regional scales.\" The first global view of SMAP's flagship product, a combined active-passive soil moisture map with a spatial resolution of 5.6 miles (9 kilometers), shows dry conditions in the Southwestern United States and in Australia's interior. Moist soil conditions are evident in the U.S. Midwest and in eastern regions of the United States, Europe and Asia. The far northern regions depicted in these SMAP maps do not indicate soil moisture measurements because the ground there was frozen. Zooming in on the data allows a closer look at the benefits of combining SMAP's radar and radiometer data. A few days before SMAP collected data over the central and southern United States on April 27, intense rainstorms pounded northern Texas. The areas affected by the storm in northern Texas and the Gulf Coast are visible in great detail. Such detail can be used to improve local weather forecasts, assist in monitoring drought in smaller watersheds, and forecast floods. Over the next year, SMAP data will be calibrated and validated by comparing it against ground measurements of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state around the world at sites representing a broad spectrum of soil types, topography, vegetation and ground cover. SMAP data also will be compared with soil moisture data from existing aircraft-mounted instruments and other satellites. Preliminary calibrated data will be available in August at designated public-access data archives, including the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, and Alaska Satellite Facility in Fairbanks. Preliminary soil moisture and freeze/thaw products will be available in November, with validated measurements scheduled to be available for use by the general science community in the summer of",

For centuries, Africans have been setting fires to increase agricultural productivity and clear land for farming. The smoke from these fires coalesces into huge plumes that have far-ranging impacts, influencing weather and precipitation patterns and supplying nutrients to land and ocean regions downwind. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, assessed how microscopic smoke particles, or aerosols, from fires south of the Sahara Desert and north of the equator affect the formation of clouds, and consequently rainfall.

    "date": null,
    "content": "5 min read Flaring of waste natural gas from industrial oil fields in the Northern Hemisphere is a potential source of significant amounts of nitrogen dioxide and black carbon to the Arctic, according to a new NASA study. Nitrogen dioxide is a well-known air pollutant and health hazard, and black carbon, also known as soot, is an agent of global warming that is critical for understanding climate change effects in the Arctic. In addition to absorbing sunlight while aloft, which heats the air, black carbon darkens white snow when it settles on the surface, accelerating snowmelt. The amount of black carbon that reaches the Arctic is currently poorly estimated. Scientists hadn't found all the sources of black carbon that ends up in the Arctic, a puzzle that was brought to the Goddard group by Joshua Fu, an atmospheric modeler at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. The atmospheric modeling community, which runs computer simulations of Earth's atmosphere, uses emission inventories reported by governments or compiled by researchers as a starting point for simulating pollution trajectories throughout the atmosphere. However, their results generally underestimated the amount of black carbon reaching the Arctic when compared to direct field measurements, Fu said. Previous researchers suggested gas flares from oil extraction in countries near the Arctic as the missing source. Gas flares are an often-overlooked subset of industrial emissions in the reported inventories, which are difficult to compile and are known to have gaps in their data that lead to over- or underestimates of pollutants. Regional estimates in Russia, for example, suggest gas flaring may account for about 30 percent of all black carbon emissions, said Fu. But with few monitoring stations near flaring sites globally, the modeling community couldn't get the accurate estimates of oil flare emissions they needed. \"They were trying to pinpoint gas flare emissions, but there's very few measurements there, so they asked us for the satellite view,\" said Can Li lead author for the Goddard team looking into the problem of the missing black carbon sources. The results were published in March in Atmospheric Environment. The first step — find the oil flares. The research team used night lights data from the NASA-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Department of Defense Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite over four known industrial oil extraction sites: Bakken, North Dakota; Athabasca Oil Sands, Canada; the North Sea near Great Britain and Norway; and western Siberia, Russia. They pinpointed the oil flares by excluding light produced from electricity in nearby towns and roads. Black carbon levels in the atmosphere cannot be directly measured by satellites from space, but indirectly it is associated with two compounds satellites can observe: the gas nitrogen dioxide and the total concentration of particles in the atmosphere called aerosols. Nitrogen dioxide is an air pollutant produced at the same time as black carbon particles from burning fossil fuels. \"The Arctic starts from a very clean state so there's no significant local pollution sources of dust or smoke, and in this kind of pristine environment even small anthropogenic sources make a big difference,\" said Nickolay Krotkov, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who was part of a team looking into the origins of Arctic black carbon. For each site, Li and Krotkov retrieved nitrogen dioxide satellite data from the Dutch-Finnish Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard NASA's Aura spacecraft, launched in",

Farmers were once able to depend solely on rivers and man-made canals fed by glaciers and rain. But as population and urbanization boomed in recent decades, the country turned to groundwater to keep up with demand. Today, more than 60 percent of Pakistan's water is pumped from natural underground reservoirs, with no limits placed on how many wells can be drilled or how much anyone can take. Now, Pakistan's water managers are looking to NASA satellites to help them more effectively monitor and manage that precious resource, thanks to a partnership with engineers and hydrologists at the University of Washington, Seattle. \"Satellites up in space looking at how much water we have underground, in rivers or in the atmosphere are providing routine observations that can help policymakers and on-the-ground managers make informed decisions,\" said Faisal Hossain, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington. \"From offering improved flood forecasting to indicating areas where groundwater resources are threatened, freely available satellite data can be an invaluable resource, particularly in developing countries.\" After training at the University of Washington, the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources in January",

    "content": "By Laura E.P. Rocchio, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center When different definitions of forest are used, satellite forest cover measurements can vary widely. Here global forest cover as measured by Landsat is shown using two different UN Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC) forest definitions: 10 percent tree cover (top) and 30 percent tree cover (bottom). Data are publicly available at www.landcover.org. Credit: Sexton, et al. Examining eight different satellite-derived maps of global forest cover, a team of scientists from NASA and other institutions noticed striking differences. The forested area on the maps differed by as much as 6 percent of Earth’s land area, nearly equivalent to the size of China. The reason, they found with the help of the Landsat satellites, was varied definitions of what constitutes a forest. With deforestation responsible for up to one-sixth of greenhouse gas emissions, an accurate measurement of global forests figures prominently into carbon cycle studies. Large international organizations vary substantially in their definition of forests. The researchers found that when different satellite-based calculations use different definitions, it can severely compromise forest area calculations in regions that have less dense tree cover, such as savannahs and shrublands. Using the world’s first global, Landsat-based 30-meter resolution map of tree cover, the scientists found that ambiguity of the term “forest” has the potential to create discrepancies double the size of the 6 percent difference found between current maps. Ecologists have long understood the complexity involved in defining forests, and geographers have called for more uniform definitions. This is the first study, however, to quantify the scope of the problem. “Whereas previous studies mentioned the discrepancy, our analysis quantified and mapped it globally and connected it to estimates of biomass and economic value,” said Joseph Sexton, a senior scientist at the University of Maryland’s Global Land Cover Facility in College Park, and lead author of the study. The findings were published Oct. 5 in Nature Climate Change by a team of researchers from the University of Maryland, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the National Wildlife Federation, the Global Environment Facility and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Sexton and his colleagues examined other factors that could account for a discrepancy between the forest maps, including clouds blocking the view of the tropics and shadows cast by tree canopies. But these potential problems were small in comparison to the definition difference. “It’s not the technology’s fault. Today’s satellites provide us with sufficient precision to make ecological measurements of forests,” Sexton said. The study found that there was significant agreement between eight global satellite-derived forest cover maps (in terms of area). These maps, created by U.S. and European science agencies and universities, use both coarse and medium resolution satellite data, and rely on differing international definitions of forest. For example, “forest” is considered anywhere with at least 10 percent forest cover in some definitions, as opposed to at least 30 percent forest cover in others. Where and why the maps disagree is now better understood. The varying definition of forest is problematic because the greenhouse gas emissions caused by deforestation have major implications for climate change, and also because deforestation leads to biodiversity reduction. It was early satellite-based maps of forest cover change that helped raise the alert about the widespread severity of global deforestation. The authors explain that this was one of the factors that eventually led to environmental policy initiatives such as the",

The Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) will bring together on-the-ground research in Alaska and northwestern Canada with data collected by NASA airborne instruments, satellites and other agency programs, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), and upcoming Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) missions. Over the next decade, scientists from NASA and other public and private organizations will investigate questions about the formidable region that spans about 2.5 million square miles (6.4 million square kilometers). \"Boreal forests and tundra are critical for understanding the ecological impacts of Earth’s changing climate,\" said Jack Kaye, associate director for research in NASA’s Earth Science Division in Washington. \"These ecosystems hold a third of the carbon stored on land — in trees, shrubs and the frozen ground of the permafrost.

But there are many unknowns about the current status of 11 species of marine mammals who depend on Arctic sea ice to live, feed and breed, and about how their fragile habitat will evolve in a warming world. A recently published multinational study attempted to gauge the population trends of Arctic marine mammals and changes in their habitat, identify missing scientific information, and provide recommendations for the conservation of Arctic marine mammals over the next decades. The Arctic sea ice cover, made of frozen seawater floating on top of the Arctic Ocean and its neighboring seas, naturally grows in the fall and winter and melts during the spring and summer every year. But over the past decades, the melt season has grown longer and the average extent of Arctic sea ice has diminished, changing the game for many Arctic marine mammals – namely beluga, narwhal and bowhead whales; ringed, bearded, spotted, ribbon, harp and hooded seals; walruses; and polar bears. \"This research would not have been possible without support from NASA,\" said Kristin Laidre, lead author of the new study and a polar scientist with University of Washington in Seattle. \"NASA backed us on research related to the biodiversity and ecology of Arctic marine mammals, as well as the development of metrics for the loss of sea ice, their habitat.\" Laidre’s team used the Arctic sea ice record derived from microwave measurements taken by NASA and Department of Defense satellites.

    "content": "6 min read By Laurie J. Schmidt,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory If you’ve ever gone snorkeling, you know that getting to the calm water that offers the best visibility often requires first muscling your way through the breaking waves in the surf zone. These waves form far from shore in the deep ocean, but it’s not until they hit an obstacle – like the shoreline – that their force and momentum becomes obvious. \"You have this enormous difference in where the waves are produced, and where they actually have an effect,\" said Eric Fetzer, a project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"A quarter mile out from shore, the waves barely even move you, but if you go 1,000 miles offshore, those waves are forming somewhere.\" An ocean wave is a type of gravity wave, named for the restoring force of gravity that pulls down on the water as the force of buoyancy pushes it back up. The simplest examples of gravity waves are familiar small ripples in a pond or large waves in the ocean. These occur at the water's surface where it meets the less-dense air. Because the atmosphere becomes less dense with altitude, it too can support gravity waves, but atmospheric gravity waves spread both upward and outward. Just as pond ripples or ocean waves are often created by wind, atmospheric gravity waves are created as wind blows over mountains. And just as surface waves crash into the coastline, gravity waves also break in the atmosphere, creating a high-altitude surf zone and generating air turbulence. \"If you’ve ever flown into Denver International Airport, much of the time you get bumped like crazy at about 15,000 feet,\" said Fetzer. \"The ‘surf zone’ happens to be right where you’re landing over Denver.\" Although air turbulence often occurs as a result of thunderstorms, it can also occur in clear-sky conditions, causing an aircraft to start rocking under benign conditions. \"Breaking gravity waves are a major source of clear-air turbulence,\" said Fetzer. \"You’ll look out the window and it will be sunny and clear and suddenly the plane starts jostling.\" Air turbulence is one of the leading causes of aircraft damage and passenger injury, but fortunately, pilots can avoid atmospheric waves if they know where they are. \"It’s pretty easy to predict where they’re going to form – the worst is always going to be flying downwind of mountains, like in Denver,\" Fetzer said. Gravity waves that form on the leeward (downwind) side of mountains are known as mountain waves. Using observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA's Aqua satellite, researchers are learning that these mountain waves travel high up into the atmosphere, triggered by topography at the Earth’s surface. \"With AIRS, we discovered that mountain waves at very high altitudes in the stratosphere were generated by small islands in the Southern Ocean,\" said Joan Alexander, a senior research scientist at Northwest Research Associates Inc. Just as an ocean wave breaks when it hits the beach, gravity waves break when the air bumps into a mountain. The disturbance then sends the waves rippling up instead of outward. Alexander’s study revealed “hotspots” of gravity waves above islands with an elevation of at least 3,500 feet. \"The gravity waves were generated by the flow of air over these islands, and they traveled very high from the surface all the way up into the stratosphere,\" Alexander said. \"They were very clear in the AIRS data, and we were able to quantify their importance to general circulation.\" General circulation, which describes wind patterns in the atmosphere, is a key variable in climate models. Any mechanism that affects general circulation must be accounted for in a model, or the predictions based on that model will be wrong. Because small mountainous islands comprise only a fraction of the total area represented, a global model can’t resolve them. \"You have a model that’s trying to cover the whole globe, and the effect of these tiny islands is too fine a detail,\" Alexander said. \"By trying to approximate what these gravity waves are doing to the general circulation, we get the answers closer to correct, and then the whole model behaves more similarly to the way the real atmosphere works.\" Detecting gravity waves wasn’t one of the AIRS instrument’s scheduled duties; it was scientific instinct that told Alexander and her colleagues to look for them in the data. \"We believed gravity waves ought to be there in the data, because AIRS has this wonderful resolution and sensors at the right radiation wavelength to capture temperature variations at small scales,\" she said. Eric Fetzer NASA project scientist But the existing AIRS data products employed a resolution too coarse to expose gravity waves. So, Alexander and her colleagues went back to the raw data to look for the temperature fluctuations that signal the location of gravity waves. \"We looked, and out popped these beautiful banded wave features in the data,\" she said. \"In hindsight it makes sense, but because [the island waves] were neglected in the global models, we assumed their effects were negligible.\" Fetzer says the ability to pinpoint gravity wave hotspots, and account for their impacts on circulation, is crucial to improving long-term climate predictions – in addition to forecasting air turbulence. \"It’s really remarkable when you think about it – the whole structure of the atmosphere way up there is determined by these waves that start way down here,\" said Fetzer. \"If we’re going to forecast what the climate will be doing 50 years from now, we need to have some idea of how these waves are interacting.\" Proof-of-concept results from the mouth of the Tijuana River in San Diego County show how… Science in Space June",

    "content": "4 min read A new NASA-led study has found that in at least part of the Arctic, scientists are not doing as good a job of detecting changes in carbon dioxide during the long, dark winter months as they are at monitoring changes during the short summer. That's a concern, because growing Arctic plants can act as a brake on global warming rates by removing carbon from the atmosphere, but increasing cold-season emissions could overwhelm the braking effect and accelerate global warming. Led by Nicholas Parazoo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, the new study compares our ability to observe increases in cold-season emissions of carbon dioxide and increases in warm-season removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The cold-season emissions come mainly from deep soil layers that retain enough summer heat to remain thawed after the soil's surface freezes in the fall. As the climate continues to warm, these buried layers are expected to remain unfrozen later and later into the winter, releasing more and more carbon. It will be important for scientists to track these releases carefully. However, it's hard to monitor carbon dioxide in the Far North. Alaska is more accessible than most of the Arctic, but most of the state is too remote and rugged for ground measurements to be collected. Satellite and airborne measurements fill these geographical gaps, but their higher-altitude measurements capture carbon dioxide that drifted into the state from sources that may be far outside the Arctic, as well as the locally produced gas, making small local changes hard to spot. Parazoo and his co-authors conducted a series of simulations with a global carbon forecast model. First they predicted how carbon dioxide will change as plants grow and deep soil layers thaw, then they simulated how well those changes could be observed if today's airborne and satellite measurements continued unchanged in the future.

    "content": "5 min read A team of NASA and university scientists has developed a new way to use satellite measurements to track changes in Atlantic Ocean currents, which are a driving force in global climate. The finding opens a path to better monitoring and understanding of how ocean circulation is changing and what the changes may mean for future climate. In the Atlantic, currents at the ocean surface, such as the Gulf Stream, carry sun-warmed water from the tropics northeastward. As the water moves through colder regions, it sheds its heat. By the time it gets to Greenland, it's so cold and dense that it sinks a couple of miles down into the ocean depths. There it turns and flows back south. This open loop of shallow and deep currents is known to oceanographers as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) — part of the \"conveyor belt\" of ocean currents circulating water, heat and nutrients around the globe and affecting climate. Because the AMOC moves so much heat, any change in it is likely to be an important indicator of how our planet is responding to warming caused by increasing greenhouse gases. In the last decade, a few isolated measurements have suggested that the AMOC is slowing down and moving less water. Many researchers are expecting the current to weaken as a consequence of global warming, but natural variations may also be involved. To better understand what is going on, scientists would like to have consistent observations over time that cover the entire Atlantic. \"This [new] satellite approach allows us to improve projections of future changes and — quite literally — get to the bottom of what drives ocean current changes,\" said Felix Landerer of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, who led the research team.

But not all warming has been happening equally rapidly everywhere. Temperatures in the Arctic, for example, are rising much faster than the rest of the planet. Patrick Taylor, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, says that one of the main factors for the Arctic's rapid warming is how clouds interact with frozen seawater, known as sea ice. These interactions influence the Arctic’s albedo feedback, which is a term scientists use to describe changes in the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth due to changes in the Earth's albedo caused by increased greenhouse gases. The Earth's albedo is basically the fraction of sunlight that it reflects. Understanding what influences the Arctic’s albedo is particularly important, as its bright snow and ice make it one of the regions with the highest capacity to reflect solar energy.

For such projections to be useful, they have to accurately represent the Earth’s climate system.

Credit: University of Hawaii/NASA-JPL/Caltech. A new NASA and university study using NASA satellite data finds that tide gauges — the longest and highest-quality records of historical ocean water levels — may have underestimated the amount of global average sea level rise that occurred during the 20th century. A research team led by Philip Thompson, associate director of the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, Manoa, evaluated how various processes that cause sea level to change differently in different places may have affected past measurements. The team also included scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia. “It’s not that there’s something wrong with the instruments or the data,” said Thompson, “but for a variety of reasons, sea level does not change at the same pace everywhere at the same time. As it turns out, our best historical sea level records tend to be located where 20th century sea level rise was most likely less than the true global average.” One of the key processes the researchers looked at is the effect of “ice melt fingerprints,” which are global patterns of sea level change caused by deviations in Earth’s rotation and local gravity that occur when a large ice mass melts. To determine the unique melt fingerprint for glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets, the team used data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites on Earth’s changing gravitational field, and a novel modeling tool (developed by study co-author Surendra Adhikari and the JPL team) that simulates how ocean mass is redistributed due to ice melting. One of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive features of these fingerprints is that sea level drops in the vicinity of a melting glacier, instead of rising as might be expected. The loss of ice mass reduces the glacier’s gravitational influence, causing nearby ocean water to migrate away. But far from the glacier, the water it has added to the ocean causes sea level to rise at a much greater rate. During the 20th century, the dominant locations of global ice melt were in the Northern Hemisphere. The results of this study showed that many of the highest-quality historical water level records are taken from places where the melt fingerprints of Northern Hemisphere sources result in reduced local sea level change compared to the global average. Furthermore, the scientists found that factors capable of enhancing sea level rise at these locations, such as wind or Southern Hemisphere melt, were not likely to have counteracted the impact of fingerprints from Northern Hemisphere ice melt. The study concludes it is highly unlikely that global average sea level rose less than 5.5 inches (14 centimeters) during the 20th century. The most likely amount was closer to 6.7 inches (17 centimeters). “This is really important, because it provides answers to the question about how melt fingerprints and the influence of wind on ocean circulation affect our ability to estimate past sea level rise,” said Thompson. “These results suggest that our longest records are most likely to underestimate past global mean change and allow us to establish the minimum amount of global sea level rise that could have occurred during the last century.” Results are published in Geophysical Research Letters.

As people burn fossil fuels and clear forests, only half of the carbon dioxide released stays in the atmosphere, warming and altering Earth’s climate. The other half is removed from the air by the planet’s vegetation ecosystems and oceans. As carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere continue their rapid, human-made rise past levels not seen for hundreds of thousands of years, NASA scientists and others are confronted with an important question for the future of our planet: How long can this balancing act continue? And if forests, other vegetation and the ocean cannot continue to absorb as much or more of our carbon emissions, what does that mean for the pace of climate change in the coming century? These questions are a major priority for NASA’s Earth science research program, and the agency is preparing to ramp up its field studies, satellite monitoring and computer modeling to help answer them. Carbon is a fundamental element of life on Earth, but the increasing amount of carbon in the atmosphere – in the form of carbon dioxide and methane molecules – is also the primary element driving our warming climate. Scientists are studying how carbon moves through Earth’s atmosphere, land and ocean with an array of tools, including a new dataset of the ebbs and flows of carbon in the air. \"Today and for the past 50 to 100 years, the oceans and land biosphere have consistently taken up about half of human emissions,\" said Dave Schimel of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \"If that were to change, the effect of fossil emissions on climate would also change. We don't understand that number, and we don't know how it will change in the future.\" So researchers at NASA are tackling the questions from a number of angles. They’re monitoring land, atmosphere and oceans with airborne and satellite sensors and digging into the first results from a new satellite observatory measuring carbon dioxide. And they’re pulling all the information we have into supercomputer simulations to understand how our Earth responds to changes in carbon emissions. \"There are all these amazing data sets, but none of them quite give us the entire carbon story,\" said Lesley Ott, an atmospheric scientist with the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The models help us tie all the observations together to get at how atmospheric carbon is varying and changing, but we still have a lot of work left to do to understand how carbon moves among the land, oceans and atmosphere.\" Carbon naturally cycles through Earth’s environments. Trees and other plants take up carbon dioxide and turn it into the building blocks of roots, stems and leaves. Some of that carbon stays in the soil as the vegetation dies and gets buried. Some is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide through plant respiration, and both carbon dioxide and methane – another potent, carbon-based greenhouse gas – can be released through decomposition, land clearing and wildfire. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the tiny water-dwelling plants called phytoplankton take up the gas as well. Over many millennia, the pace of carbon cycling is governed by volcanic emissions and weathering of rocks. For most of human history, carbon has been in a more or less steady cycle. This cycle has been thrown off balance as people burn fossil fuels – carbon that has been long buried underground as oil, gas and coal – and as forests are cleared and soils are turned for agriculture. All of these contribute to increasing carbon emissions. While the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that ecosystems absorb from the atmosphere each year varies quite a bit, the fraction in the long run has averaged out to about half. More carbon dioxide and methane in the air mean warmer global temperatures. Warmer temperatures can disrupt some ecosystems and impact their ability to absorb more and more carbon. An even more imbalanced carbon cycle will cause greater variability and consequences that are not yet fully understood. NASA’s newest tool in tackling the complex question of carbon ebbs and flows is the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, or OCO-2. Launched in July",

    "content": "5 min read Two new studies by researchers at NASA and the University of California, Irvine (UCI), detect the fastest ongoing rates of glacier retreat ever observed in West Antarctica and offer an unprecedented direct view of intense ice melting from the floating undersides of glaciers. The results highlight how the interaction between ocean conditions and the bedrock beneath a glacier can influence the glacier's evolution, with implications for understanding future ice loss from Antarctica and global sea level rise. The two studies examined three neighboring glaciers in West Antarctica that are melting and retreating at different rates. Smith, Pope and Kohler glaciers flow into the Dotson and Crosson ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica, the part of the continent with the largest loss of ice mass. A study led by Bernd Scheuchl of UCI, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters on Aug. 28, used radar measurements from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 satellite and data from the earlier ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites to look at changes in the glaciers' grounding lines — the boundary where a glacier loses contact with bedrock and begins to float on the ocean. The grounding line is important because nearly all glacier melting takes place on the underside of the glacier's floating portion, called the ice shelf. If a glacier loses mass from enhanced melting, it may start floating farther inland from its former grounding line, just as a boat stuck on a sandbar may be able to float again if a heavy cargo is removed. This is called grounding line retreat. Scheuchl's team found a rapid retreat of Smith Glacier's grounding line of 1.24 miles (2 kilometers) per year since",

    "content": "11 min read Every part of the mosaic of Earth's surface — ocean and land, Arctic and tropics, forest and grassland — absorbs and releases carbon in a different way. Wild-card events such as massive wildfires and drought complicate the global picture even more. To better predict future climate, we need to understand how Earth's ecosystems will change as the climate warms and how extreme events will shape and interact with the future environment. Here are seven pressing concerns. The Far North is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth, on average. With a 5-year Arctic airborne observing campaign just wrapping up and a 10-year campaign just starting that will integrate airborne, satellite and surface measurements, NASA is using unprecedented resources to discover how the drastic changes in Arctic carbon are likely to influence our climatic future. Wildfires have become common in the North. Because firefighting is so difficult in remote areas, many of these fires burn unchecked for months, throwing huge plumes of carbon into the atmosphere. A recent report found a nearly 10-fold increase in the number of large fires in the Arctic region over the last 50 years, and the total area burned by fires is increasing annually. Organic carbon from plant and animal remains is preserved for millennia in frozen Arctic soil, too cold to decompose. Arctic soils known as permafrost contain more carbon than there is in Earth's atmosphere today. As the frozen landscape continues to thaw, the likelihood increases that not only fires but decomposition will create Arctic atmospheric emissions rivaling those of fossil fuels. The chemical form these emissions take — carbon dioxide or methane — will make a big difference in how much greenhouse warming they create. Initial results from NASA's Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) airborne campaign have allayed concerns that large bursts of methane, a more potent greenhouse gas, are already being released from thawing Arctic soils. CARVE principal investigator Charles Miller of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, is looking forward to NASA's ABoVE field campaign (Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment) to gain more insight. \"CARVE just scratched the surface, compared to what ABoVE will do,\" Miller said. Methane is the Billy the Kid of carbon-containing greenhouse gases: it does a lot of damage in a short life. There's much less of it in Earth's atmosphere than there is carbon dioxide, but molecule for molecule, it causes far more greenhouse warming than CO2 does over its average 10-year life span in the atmosphere. Methane is produced by bacteria that decompose organic material in damp places with little or no oxygen, such as freshwater marshes and the stomachs of cows. Currently, over half of atmospheric methane comes from human-related sources, such as livestock, rice farming, landfills and leaks of natural gas. Natural sources include termites and wetlands. Because of increasing human sources, the atmospheric concentration of methane has doubled in the last 200 years to a level not seen on our planet for 650,000 years. Locating and measuring human emissions of methane are significant challenges. NASA's Carbon Monitoring System is funding several projects testing new technologies and techniques to improve our ability to monitor the colorless gas and help decision makers pinpoint sources of emissions. One project, led by Daniel Jacob of Harvard University, used satellite observations of methane to infer emissions over North America. The research found that human methane emissions in eastern Texas were 50 to 100 percent higher than previous estimates. \"This study shows the potential of satellite observations to assess how methane emissions are changing,\" said Kevin Bowman, a JPL research scientist who was a coauthor of the study. Tropical forests are carbon storage heavyweights. The Amazon in South America alone absorbs a quarter of all carbon dioxide that ends up on land. Forests in Asia and Africa also do their part in \"breathing in\" as much carbon dioxide as possible and using it to grow. However, there is evidence that tropical forests may be reaching some kind of limit to growth. While growth rates in temperate and boreal forests continue to increase, trees in the Amazon have been growing more slowly in recent years. They've also been dying sooner. That's partly because the forest was stressed by two severe droughts in",

    "content": "3 min read Scientists have produced the first global maps of human emissions of carbon dioxide ever made solely from satellite observations of the greenhouse gas. The maps, based on data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and generated with a new data-processing technique, agree well with inventories of known carbon dioxide emissions. No satellite before OCO-2 was capable of measuring carbon dioxide in fine enough detail to allow researchers to create maps of human emissions from the satellite data alone. Instead, earlier maps also incorporated estimates from economic data and modeling results. The team of scientists from the Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, produced three main maps from OCO-2 data, each centered on one of Earth's highest-emitting regions: the eastern United States, central Europe and East Asia. The maps show widespread carbon dioxide across major urban areas and smaller pockets of high emissions. \"OCO-2 can even detect smaller, isolated emitting areas like individual cities,\" said research scientist Janne Hakkarainen, who led the study. \"It's a very powerful tool that gives new insight.\" The results appear in a paper titled \"Direct Space-Based Observations of Anthropogenic CO2 Emission Areas from OCO-2,\" published Nov. 1 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Human emissions of carbon dioxide have grown at a significant rate since the Industrial Revolution, and the greenhouse gas lingers in the atmosphere for a century or more. This means that recent human output is only a tiny part of the total carbon dioxide that OCO-2 records as it looks down toward Earth's surface. \"Currently, the background level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about 400 parts per million, and human emissions within the past year may add only something like three parts per million to that total,\" said Hakkarainen. The data-processing challenge, he noted, was to isolate the signature of the recent emissions from the total amount. The team's new data-processing technique accounts for seasonal changes in carbon dioxide, the result of plant growth and dormancy, as well as the background carbon dioxide level. To be sure their method was correct, they compared the results with measurements of nitrogen dioxide -- another gas emitted from fossil fuel combustion -- from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, a Dutch-Finnish instrument on NASA's Aura satellite. OMI and OCO-2 are both in the A-Train satellite constellation, so the two measurements cover the same area of Earth and are separated in time by only 15 minutes. The two measurements correlated well, giving the researchers confidence that their new technique produced reliable results. Coauthor Johanna Tamminen, head of the atmospheric remote sensing group at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, noted that with its comparison of OCO-2 and OMI data, \"The research demonstrates the possibility of analyzing joint satellite observations of carbon dioxide and other gases related to combustion processes to draw out information about the emissions sources.\" OCO-2 Deputy Project Scientist Annmarie Eldering of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, said, \"We are very pleased to see this research group make use of the OCO-2 data.

View larger image. Research using NASA satellite measurements has given scientists a better understanding of what happens to rain and snow that falls on land — how much runs off into rivers, lakes and aquifers; how much plants use; and how much simply evaporates. Among the new findings: plants around the world use less water than previous studies had indicated, and most freshwater passes more rapidly through soil than previously thought, with less exposure to the nutrients and contaminants contained there. Understanding how precipitation, plants, soil, groundwater and other fresh water interact is important for improving large-scale climate models and regional and local hydrology models. Water that has taken different pathways through the water cycle — water released by plants during photosynthesis versus water evaporated from a lake, for example — contains different ratios of hydrogen and the hydrogen isotope deuterium. Researchers from the University of Utah, Salt Lake City; and Oregon State University, Corvallis, analyzed the two forms of hydrogen in atmospheric water vapor as measured from space by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Aura satellite, and also in global water samples. The researchers accounted for each different isotopic signature in a computer simulation, producing a narrow range of estimates of the amount of water released to the atmosphere by each pathway. More than a quarter of the rain and snow that falls on continents runs off directly, ending up in the ocean. Of the water that does not run off, two-thirds is eventually released by plants during photosynthesis. The last third evaporates — mostly from plant leaves, with a few percent evaporating from bare ground or water. \"Some previous estimates suggested that more water was used by plants than we find here,\" said University of Utah hydrologist Stephen Good, first author of a paper on the research recently published in Science. Good said that means \"either plants are less productive globally than we thought, or plants are more efficient at using water than we assumed.\" Good noted, \"In a variety of models — from large-scale climate models to regional and local hydrology models — we try to simulate all these pathways, but we currently have difficulty measuring them individually. Our study presents a new approach for measuring the importance of these pathways and provides a new, improved estimate at the global scale.\" For more information on the study, see: http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/water-cycle/ To learn more about TES: http://tes.jpl.nasa.gov/ Fast facts A new study uses NASA satellite measurements of hydrogen to clarify what happens to precipitation on land after it falls. Plants appear to be using less water than previously estimated. This could mean that there's not as much plant growth worldwide as we thought, or that plants use water more efficiently than we thought. Water also passes through soil more rapidly than earlier studies showed, a finding that has implications for water quality. This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

This month, NASA begins an airborne experiment to improve scientists’ understanding of the sources of two powerful greenhouse gases and how they cycle into and out of the atmosphere. Atmospheric Carbon and Transport–America, or ACT-America, is a multi-year airborne campaign that will measure concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in relation to weather systems. The study will gather real-time measurements from research aircraft and ground stations to improve the ability to detect and quantify the surface sources and sinks of the gases. \"Carbon dioxide and methane are the two most important long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” said Ken Davis, ACT-America principal investigator from Pennsylvania State University, University Park. “We have a very difficult time inferring important sources and sinks of these gases, including uptake of carbon dioxide by the biosphere, and emission of methane from a variety of human and biological sources. We hope to improve our ability to measure those sources and sinks today, which should enable improvements in the management and simulation of future climate.\" ACT-America will employ a new generation of data analysis systems to convert regional observations of greenhouse gas concentrations and the meteorological conditions that move them around the atmosphere into more accurate estimates of where on the surface the gases originated and where they are absorbed. These data will fill in the details of how the gases are moved by weather systems, information that will help scientists interpret the long-term greenhouse gas observations more accurately. Currently, the ability to determine sources and sinks of greenhouse gases relies on long-term observations from a sparse network of tower-based instruments.

    "date": null,
    "content": "From NASA Eric Hochberg, the principal investigator for NASA's COral Reef Airborne Laboratory (CORAL) campaign, is a research scientist at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, St. George's, Bermuda. CORAL will survey more of the world's coral reefs, and in far greater detail, than ever before to measure the condition of these threatened ecosystems. It will combine airborne and shipboard sensor observations to create a uniform dataset on reefs around the globe. Hochberg: CORAL is going to give reef scientists — and resource managers and the public — a new perspective on coral reefs. We've learned a fantastic amount by scuba diving on reefs. CORAL will let us see the whole ecosystem in one picture. Hochberg: Coral reefs provide very valuable ecosystem goods and services. Reefs are a focus for traditional culture and provide food for innumerable small subsistence economies. They protect shorelines from storm and wave damage and form barriers that provide safe passage for shipping. They are a superlative recreational resource and the foundation of a multibillion-dollar tourist industry worldwide. Coral reefs are a locus of biodiversity and genetic complexity. Their high species diversity is a storehouse for the biotechnology industry, enabling researchers to isolate and identify chemical substances and biochemical mechanisms with potential value for new medicines. The global economic valuation of the direct and indirect use of coral reefs has been estimated at nearly $400 billion annually. Unfortunately, because reef ecosystems are already stressed by human activities at local and regional scales, they may be unable to withstand the impact of global climate change. The interconnected influences of rising sea surface temperature and increasing ocean acidification are predicted to transform reefs globally from coral-rich to coral-poor. With this shift, the predictions are that the ecosystem services and economic value provided by reefs will become severely diminished. Hochberg: First, and most important, these areas have all types of reefs (fringing, barrier and atoll reefs in oceanic and continental shelf locations) and span a range of environmental conditions that reef scientists have identified as influencing reefs. Second, these areas are readily accessible for both airborne and in-water observations. Hochberg: For the in-water validation teams, the day will start around 6 a.m. with breakfast, prep work and a weather briefing with the airborne team. Gear will be loaded into boats, and we'll shove off around 8 a.m. Different boats have different tasks. One team will continually measure light in and above the water. Another will deploy instruments to measure reef primary production and calcification. The last team will be scuba diving to survey the reef surface itself. The boats return to shore around 3 p.m., and all the equipment is cleaned and prepped for the next day. The airborne team will be flying over the reef during the day, collecting spectral images with the PRISM [Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer] instrument. At the end of the day, the airborne team and in-water teams will meet to decide on the next day's activities. This will include discussing the weather forecast and flight targets. Hochberg: PRISM is the most recent, and best, version of a technology that goes back decades. It \"sees\" sunlight reflected from underwater reefs the same way our eyes do, but PRISM has an advantage over our eyes in that it carefully measures this reflected light in hundreds of different colors. Algorithms developed for CORAL use the subtle differences between colors to identify features on the reef. Hochberg: CORAL's two objectives, in very simple terms, are to collect data and to analyze those data. So the first people to use CORAL data will be researchers working on the CORAL mission. CORAL data will be analyzed against known environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature, carbonate chemistry) for each reef in the survey. The result will be a set of quantitative, empirical models that can be used to estimate current global reef condition and forecast reef condition under scenarios of predicted global change. The new models will be useful to scientists to better understand reef function and to resource managers to better steward these vital ecosystems through global change. CORAL will serve as a pathfinder for possible future satellite missions with instruments similar to PRISM, producing the first comprehensive and consistent assessment of reef condition for a significant proportion of the world’s coral reefs. Finally, CORAL will represent the initiation of a long-term ecosystem observation program that will be carried on through the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission and its successors.

Global climate change is like that: You can't understand it if all you have is a few years of data from a few locations. That's one reason that a fourth-generation satellite launching this summer is something to get excited about. Jason-3, a mission led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that is currently scheduled to launch on July 22, is the latest in a series of U.S.-European satellite missions that have been measuring the height of the ocean surface for 23 years. Sea level height is a critical piece of evidence about Earth's natural cycles and how humans are affecting our planet. Knowing sea level height also improves hurricane forecasts, navigation and the efficiency of fisheries and other offshore industries (see below). Most people think that, except for waves, the ocean is flat. It's not. The ocean has topography just as land does. Ocean currents cause hills and valleys in the sea surface that vary in height by more than six feet (two meters) from one place to another. And just as Earth's rocky landscapes change because of erosion and many other causes, its watery hills and valleys also change. High points on the sea surface tend to be over warm water and valleys over cold water, with currents flowing around the hills and valleys. Because the ocean absorbs more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by human-emitted greenhouse gases, monitoring the changing ocean topography is a key to understanding how the ocean responds to and influences climate change. Of course, the ocean changes naturally as well, with cycles like the Pacific Ocean's El Niño and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which change the height and temperature of the sea surface. Scientists want to understand these natural cycles better. \"Jason-3 might witness a new phase of the PDO,\" said Josh Willis of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA's Jason-3 project scientist.

Just ask the people charged with the safety of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), one of the climate-research satellites orbiting our planet. When the sun hurled an enormous electromagnetic storm at us in mid-June, they were forced to shut down CALIPSO’s laser instrument for 11 days to prevent potentially catastrophic damage. CALIPSO’s operators heeded a warning from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) run by NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. SWPC’s ability to forecast space weather is about to improve thanks to a new spacecraft called the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), which has just taken its sentry post a million miles sunward of Earth. A number of spacecraft currently report solar activity to the SWPC, but DSCOVR is the first deep-space spacecraft whose primary mission is to keep an eye on space weather. What are these storms in space? They start on the surface of the sun, when titanic magnetic forces launch enormous blobs of the sun’s surface into space at millions of miles per hour. These blobs are called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and consist of magnetic field and plasma—largely protons, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, but also the nuclei of heavy elements like oxygen and iron. When a CME smashes into Earth’s magnetic field, it triggers beautiful auroras but it can also play havoc with power grids, radio communications and satellites. And then there’s the effect on the solar wind, a constant outflowing of particles from the sun that streams through space. CMEs often generate shock waves similar to what happens when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier in Earth’s atmosphere. But the solar wind’s equivalent of a sonic boom can accelerate protons up to millions of miles per minute —as much as 40 percent of the speed of light. The result is called a solar radiation storm. The ultra-fast, ultra-high-energy protons and other nuclei in these storms create their own hazards for satellites and radio communication, as well as for people in space and even in aircraft flying at high latitudes and altitudes. The particles comprising CMEs and solar radiation storms are too sparse to buffet spacecraft like an earthly hurricane attacking a ship.

    "content": "4 min read Earth’s seas and oceans have high and low points, just like Earth’s continents have hills and valleys. The difference is that sea surface topography is affected by temperature, currents and underwater mountains and trenches. Scientists like Josh Willis are working to understand how sea level rise, warming oceans and sea surface topography will interact and affect our planet as our climate continues to change. 1. What is sea surface topography and how do we measure it? Sea surface topography is the height and shape of the ocean’s surface. Certain parts of the ocean are taller than others because of currents or, in some cases, because of underwater mountains that pile up the ocean water. The most comprehensive way to measure topography is from space. You fly a satellite over the ocean and shoot the surface with a radar wave. Then you wait for the wave to bounce off the ocean and come back. By measuring the time it takes the wave to go down and come back, you can tell how far away the ocean is from the satellite. So as it flies, the satellite will trace out the topography of the sea surface. 2. How big are these topographic features? Do they stay in the same place, or do they move around? These things happen over many miles. For example, a large variation in sea surface height can range by a few feet in a few miles. The surface topography that is caused by underwater mountains, which would then create a hill at the ocean surface, or by an underwater trench, which would cause a valley—those stay in the same place because the mountains on the sea floor don’t move around. But the topographic features that are there because of currents move around and are the ones oceanographers tend to be the most interested in. Those variations in sea surface topography are caused by ocean currents that tilt the sea surface. 3. How do temperature and global warming affect sea surface topography? Typically, warm water takes up more space than cold water—it’s less dense. When we observe a high sea level, oftentimes it’s because there’s warm water not just at the surface but down deeper as well. So sea level is rising for two different reasons. One is because glaciers and ice sheets all over the world are melting and the extra water raises sea levels. But also sea levels are rising because the ocean is absorbing almost all of the extra heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But the extra heat doesn’t go in the ocean evenly everywhere. Some places are getting more heat than others, and this can cause changes in ocean currents, and it also means that sea levels rise faster in some places than in others. 4. What role do regional variations in sea level play in weather and climate? Changes in sea level tell us where the warm water is and where oceans carry warm water around. In places where the warm water is at the surface, it can have a big impact on weather and climate. One example of that is the El Niño phenomenon, which involves a bunch of warm water that is normally in the West Pacific moving to the East Pacific. When it does that, it disrupts the jet stream and causes weather patterns to change all over the United States and sometimes all over the world. One of the main ways we monitor El Niño is by looking at sea level measured by satellites. 5. What are the big questions that scientists are asking about ocean topography right now? One big question is \"What’s going on at the smallest scales?\" Our satellites are really good at telling us when the entire North Pacific gets warmer or when a big El Niño is running from the West Pacific to the East Pacific. But the smaller things—like eddies, really sharp boundary currents and natural mixing in the ocean—are too small for the current generation of satellite altimeters to see. But in",

NASA's Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) field campaign is gathering data that will help scientists both to understand how the oceans are joining with the atmosphere in melting the vast ice sheet and to predict the extent and timing of the resulting sea level rise. \"A lot of the major uncertainty in future sea level rise is in the Greenland Ice Sheet,\" said OMG principal investigator Josh Willis, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. At about 660,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometers), the ice sheet is three times the size of Texas. It's about a mile deep on average and contains enough water to raise global sea levels about 20 feet (6 meters), if it were all to melt. \"The question is how fast it's melting,\" Willis said. If the ice sheet were simply melting from the top down, researchers could track its disappearance more easily. However, ocean water melts ice too. The northwest Atlantic Ocean has been warming at an unprecedented rate for the last 10 to 15 years. Where that warm, salty water can reach Greenland's glaciers, it accelerates their melting. Finding out where that is happening is no easy task. Greenland's coastline is more than 27,000 miles (44,000 kilometers) long — longer than the distance around Earth at the equator — because of the island's hundreds of long, narrow fjords, many containing glaciers. Just as the coast is scored by fjords, Greenland's shallow continental shelf is gouged by underwater canyons cut by the glaciers of the last ice age. In this part of the world, the warmest water is down deep in the ocean, but that water may be able to get into the underwater canyons and reach the glaciers. \"We don't know how deep almost all of the glaciers and the fjords are, nor where the deep canyons cut through the continental shelf,\" said OMG co-investigator Ian Fenty of JPL. OMG is making the first high-resolution maps of the complete Greenland coast and continental shelf. The maps are just the opening act of the OMG campaign, however. From next year to",

    "content": "7 min read On Greenland's ice sheet, a vast icy landscape crisscrossed by turquoise rivers and dotted with meltwater lakes, a small cluster of orange camping tents popped up in late July. The camp, home for a week to a team of researchers, sat by a large, fast-flowing river. Just half a mile (a kilometer) downstream, the river dropped into a seemingly bottomless moulin, or sinkhole in the ice. The low rumble of the waters, the shouted instructions from scientists taking measurements, and the chop of the blades of a helicopter delivering personnel and gear were all that was heard in the frozen landscape. This camp was Laurence C. Smith's field research site in western Greenland. Smith, a professor and chair of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his NASA-funded team were studying the hydrology of the ice sheet — how the shifting network of streams and rivers that form during the melt season transport water from the surface of the ice to the ocean, contributing to sea level rise. \"Surface melting in Greenland has increased recently, and we lacked a rigorous estimate of the water volumes being produced and their transport,\" said Tom Wagner, the cryosphere program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"NASA funds fieldwork like Smith's because it helps us to interpret satellite data, and to extrapolate measurements from the local field sites to the larger ice sheet.\" Greenland loses ice to the sea mainly through two processes: the shedding of icebergs from glaciers that run into the sea, and surface melt runoff. \"Losses [from icebergs] have been studied in great detail by scientists for years, but the meltwater component, despite being the dominant agent in the ice sheet's mass balance, has received comparatively less study,\" Smith said. \"This is particularly true for the surface water hydrology on top of the ice sheet, which has received very little study.\" The handful of surface water hydrology studies have mostly focused on Greenland's massive meltwater lakes, which can drain in a matter of hours, engulfed by the ice. But Smith and his team believe that rivers sinking into holes in the ice are the main agent transporting water from the top to the bottom of the ice sheet. \"While lake drainages do suddenly pump a large volume of water to the ice sheet, in fact, the amount of water they put into the ice sheet is almost trivial compared to the flux of water moving through these intricate, very efficient drainage networks [of rivers] that spread across the surface each summer,\" Smith said. Besides contributing to sea level rise, meltwater runoff also accelerates ice loss: when the water percolates through the ice sheet and reaches the rock below, it slightly lifts the ice, helping it flow faster toward the ocean. Also, the intensity and the area of surface melt are projected to increase with climate change. The increase in resolution of satellite imagery during the last decade has allowed researchers to better map meltwater rivers and identify candidate sites for field research. Still, it is logistically very challenging to set up camp in the melt zone. The National Science Foundation coordinates the transport of equipment and personnel to Greenland. Then all researchers and tools have to be helicoptered in from the nearest town — in Smith's case, Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland. Researchers often have to move camp, since the melt quickly makes everything too soggy. More importantly, the scientists go to great lengths to ensure safety. Were anyone to slip and fall in the frigid waters, he or she would be quickly swept away into the moulin without any possibility of rescue, disappearing forever. For this reason, researchers must tether themselves to ropes when working near the rivers. The moulin near Smith's camp drained a catchment, or single network of streams flowing to a river, encompassing about 27 square miles (70 square kilometers) of the Greenland ice sheet. As the river by the camp approached the sinkhole, its waters carved a steep canyon in the ice. The team marked the limits of no-go zones with bright orange tape, confining their data collection to a safe, flat riverbank. Still, the researchers were roped in to avoid falls while they moved an instrument called an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler back and forth across the river. The instrument bounced sound waves through the waters to measure the water's depth and velocity. Farther upstream, Smith deployed three autonomous drift boats equipped with GPS, sonar and other sensors. As the instruments floated down the river, they transmitted their location and measurements of the water's temperature and depth until they were swallowed by the moulin. The data will allow researchers to calculate the volume of water entering the sinkhole. Smith's team will use the field measurements to calibrate remote estimates taken by satellites, such as the twin satellites of NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the commercial WorldView spacecraft, and aircraft missions such as NASA's Operation IceBridge. The field data will allow researchers to check the accuracy of regional climate models used to estimate future sea level rise. They will also incorporate the measurements into a computer model to create a simulation of meltwater runoff processes operating on the ice sheet. On July 19, Smith's camp on the Greenland ice sheet had visitors: researchers Marco Tedesco, an associate professor at the City College of New York, and Tom Mote, a climatologist at the University of Georgia, Athens. The two scientists were taking measurements of the albedo (the ability to reflect sunshine) of the basin. Albedo changes during the melt season because the melting process makes the snow and ice crystals grow and become less reflective. At the same time, dark material such as soot and dust is darkening the ice. The darker the surface is, the more energy it absorbs, which leads to more melting. Using a helicopter, Tedesco and Mote were flying the prototype of a new spectrometer — an instrument that measures the intensity of solar light: first pointing it at the sky to calculate how much solar radiation was coming down, and then downward to see how much energy the ice sheet was absorbing. The researchers were also collecting geo-located, very high-resolution images from a digital camera mounted under the belly of the helicopter. Tedesco said that he and Mote were overlapping their data collection with Smith's field site because the two projects were complementary. \"The albedo is driving the melting, and the melting is generating the runoff that is creating the rivers Larry studies,\" Tedesco said. \"We're going to provide Larry a very detailed map of albedo for this area, which he will use to better understand where melting is more intense or less intense, and where the water that is feeding his streams and rivers is coming from.\" Mote, Tedesco and Smith's research are only a portion of the complementary research that NASA is funding this summer in Greenland: the agency provides funds for dozens of projects that look into factors such as the role of warming ocean waters in melting glaciers from below, or how the land rebounds as it sheds ice. All of these programs have the ultimate goal to increase our knowledge of how fast and how much Greenland will impact sea level rise in the upcoming decades.

    "content": "By Kate Ramsayer, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center A grayish turquoise melt pond on the Greenland ice sheet, as seen from the air. Credit: NASA Earlier this month, a NASA instrument nestled in the belly of a small plane flew over Greenland’s ice sheet and the Arctic Ocean’s icy waters. Flying above creviced glaciers, chunks of ice floating in melt ponds, and the slushy edges of the ice sheets, the instrument used a rapidly firing laser to measure the elevation of the surface below. The three-week airborne campaign’s goal was to verify how the green laser light interacts with different types of snow and ice. Then, when the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, or ICESat-2, launches with a similar green laser aboard, scientists can gather precise information to tackle questions about Earth’s frozen regions — including how meltwater from ice sheets is contributing to sea level rise. \"Ice sheets like East Antarctica, West Antarctica or Greenland — these are big places where just a little bit of change over that massive area ends up being a lot of water into the sea,\" said Kelly Brunt, an assistant research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"NASA's trying to quantify that.\" The Greenland campaign is part of a multi-year, pre-launch effort to find out as much as possible about how lasers and photon detectors similar to those on ICESat-2 measure ice sheet height, and what that photon data looks like. With data from another airborne campaign flying the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar, or MABEL, instrument, the ICESat-2 science team has developed computer programs to develop data products for the upcoming satellite mission. \"MABEL really gave us a chance to develop data products and algorithms to find the surface, over trees and deserts and oceans and lakes and sea ice and land ice — everywhere we flew it,\" Neumann said. Developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-counting Lidar (SIMPL) that flew over Greenland this month will similarly help researchers prepare for analyzing ICESat-2 data. SIMPL takes height measurements with both a red and a green laser, which will allow scientists to determine whether green light behaves differently when it reflects off different types of snow and ice. \"SIMPL makes for better data products, and better data products make for better sea level change estimates,\" Neumann noted. Alongside SIMPL, the campaign flew an instrument called Airborne Visual Imaging Infrared Spectrometer – Next Generation, or AVIRIS-NG, developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This imaging spectrometer lets scientists identify the properties of snow and ice below, assisting the SIMPL analysis. On orbit, ICESat-2 will use its laser instrument to measure the height of the planet's surface — from glaciers to forest canopies to the ocean. It's a relatively new technology. The first ICESat mission measured height using a single strong laser beam, timing how long it took a pulse of photons to bounce off the ground and return to the satellite, thousands of photons at a time. The second-generation ICESat-2 mission will use six weaker laser beams — but it will carry detectors that can time the round trips of individual photons. This leads to lots more data points, and a need for new methods to analyze that data. As it flies over ice sheets, taking height measurements over the same spots each season, ICESat-2 will provide a record of elevation change over time. With this information, scientists can use computer programs to estimate how much water has melted into the ocean from land ice change. It's not an easy task, though, Brunt said. When snow builds up on an ice sheet, its density depends on the air temperatures and snowfall rate. And the ground beneath layers of snow and ice can deform as ice melts or builds up above it. Both of those factors, plus a host of others, will be built into the computer programs to help scientists analyze the data. ICESat-2 will also measure sea level directly, said Tom Neumann, the mission's deputy project scientist, as it makes its 15 orbits a day. \"It’s a global mission, taking data everywhere — and it's going to spend most of its time over the ocean, collecting data,\" Neumann said. \"You can see the same patch of ocean over and over and over again.\" With thousands of data points averaged over large areas, ICESat-2 can help map the surface elevation of the ocean, especially when combined with data from other satellite missions.

    "content": "3 min read A new NASA-led study finds that almost one-fifth of the global warming that has occurred in the past 150 years has been missed by historical records due to quirks in how global temperatures were recorded. The study explains why projections of future climate based solely on historical records estimate lower rates of warming than predictions from climate models. The study applied the quirks in the historical records to climate model output and then performed the same calculations on both the models and the observations to make the first true apples-to-apples comparison of warming rates. With this modification, the models and observations largely agree on expected near-term global warming. The results were published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Mark Richardson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, is the lead author. The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of Earth, but there are fewer historic temperature readings from there than from lower latitudes because it is so inaccessible. A data set with fewer Arctic temperature measurements naturally shows less warming than a climate model that fully represents the Arctic. Because it isn't possible to add more measurements from the past, the researchers instead set up the climate models to mimic the limited coverage in the historical records. The new study also accounted for two other issues. First, the historical data mix air and water temperatures, whereas model results refer to air temperatures only. This quirk also skews the historical record toward the cool side, because water warms less than air. The final issue is that there was considerably more Arctic sea ice when temperature records began in the",

Credit: The Ohio State University/NASA-JPL-Caltech. › Larger image Key Points ◆ Researchers created the first-ever map of previously hidden underground flows of water connecting fresh groundwater supplies beneath the contiguous United States with seawater in the oceans. Key Points ◆ 21 percent of the contiguous U.S. coastline was found to be susceptible to land-to-sea or sea-to-land water contamination. Key Points ◆ The analysis may help water managers better plan strategies for coastal land development and groundwater management to preserve water quality. Coastal waters and near-shore groundwater supplies along more than a fifth of coastlines in the contiguous United States are vulnerable to contamination from previously hidden underground transfers of water between the oceans and land, finds a new study by researchers at The Ohio State University, Columbus, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The study, published online Aug. 4 in the journal Science, offers the first-ever map of the underground flows that connect fresh groundwater beneath the contiguous United States and seawater in the surrounding oceans. The map highlights areas most vulnerable to degraded water quality from these flows now and in the future. The researchers combined U.S. topographic data and NASA climate models to identify key inland regions that contribute groundwater and contaminants to the coast. They examined rainfall, evaporation rates and the amount of known surface runoff to calculate the missing portion of water that was running out below ground, then melded those results with terrain and land-use data to identify where the water ended up. The team was able to learn more about the previously hidden water exchanges via computer analyses, without extensive and costly field surveys. Audrey Sawyer, assistant professor of Earth Sciences at The Ohio State University and leader of the study, said that while scientists have long known that freshwater and seawater mix unseen below ground, until now they hadn't been able to pinpoint exactly where it was happening, or how much, except in limited locations. \"We're all pretty familiar with the idea that rain falls on land and flows out to the ocean in rivers, but there's another, hidden component of rainfall that infiltrates the ground near the coast and spills into the ocean below sea level,\" Sawyer said. \"It's known as 'submarine groundwater discharge.' Freshwater flows out to sea, and vice versa. Urbanization, agricultural development, climate and topography all affect how much water flows in either direction, and the exchange has a big impact on both onshore groundwater that we drink and offshore seawater where we swim and fish.\" What areas are most vulnerable? The study identified 12 percent of the contiguous U.S. coastline — including the northern Gulf Coast from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle, northern Atlantic Coast and Pacific Northwest — as areas where once-hidden drainage systems make the ocean most susceptible to contamination from septic tanks and fertilizer in freshwater. There, excess nutrients in the water can cause harmful algal blooms to form, which remove vital oxygen from the water. This contamination from land to sea endangers fisheries and coral reefs, as well as water recreation and tourism. In contrast, the team found that another 9 percent of coastline — including confirmed locations such as Southeastern Florida, Southern California and Long Island, New York — are especially susceptible to the opposite threat: contamination from sea to land. In these areas, saltwater intrudes inland and infiltrates the fresh groundwater supply. \"It takes only a small amount of salt water to render drinking water non-potable, so saltwater invasion is a big concern for water resource management in coastal areas,\" Sawyer said. The study found Los Angeles and San Francisco are vulnerable to both ocean contamination and saltwater intrusion. How much water is involved? Overall, the study calculates that more than 15 billion tons of freshwater flow through invisible underground networks into the ocean along the contiguous U.S. coastline every year. That sounds like a lot of water, but it's less than 1 percent of the total amount that flows from the contiguous United States into the ocean, said study co-author Cedric David of JPL. The other 99 percent comes from rivers and surface runoff. Still, David explained, the study is significant because it provides the first contiguous-scale, high-resolution estimate of that 1 percent — a portion which, when compared to the other 99 percent, can be particularly rich in nutrients and other contaminants. \"This Ohio State-JPL collaboration has removed the cloak from hidden groundwater transfers between land and sea,\" he said. For example, the amount of yearly precipitation is similar in the Pacific Northwest and the mid-Atlantic regions, but the study found that underground drainage rates into the ocean were approximately 50 percent higher in the Pacific Northwest because the steep terrain there carries more groundwater to the coastline. The researchers found that land use was critical to discharge in Florida. Sawyer said that she was surprised by the big effect that canals had there. Since the early 20th century, Floridians have constructed thousands of miles of canals along the state's coasts for transportation, irrigation and recreation. The study found that the canals may capture water that would otherwise flow underground and out to sea. The researchers commented that increased urbanization — and the extensive pavement that goes along with it — will also decrease groundwater recharge and ultimate drainage to coastal regions where the population is growing, increasing the likelihood of saltwater intrusion. \"That's why we hope others will use our analysis to better plan strategies for coastal land development and groundwater management that help preserve water quality,\" Sawyer said. \"Right now, we've created a map of American coastlines that highlights some previously known as well as unknown areas of vulnerability along the U.S. coastline, but we hope to be able to do it for the world shortly, as data become available.\" Model data for the study came from the enhanced National Hydrography Dataset NHDPlus, originally built by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Geological Survey, and now developed by Horizon Systems Corporation in Herndon, Virginia; the North American Land Data Assimilation System from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland; the Variable Infiltration Capacity Macroscale Hydrologic Model from the University of Washington; the",

    "content": "4 min read NASA researchers have helped produce the first map showing what parts of the bottom of the massive Greenland Ice Sheet are thawed — key information in better predicting how the ice sheet will react to a warming climate. Greenland’s thick ice sheet insulates the bedrock below from the cold temperatures at the surface, so the bottom of the ice is often tens of degrees warmer than the top, because the ice bottom is slowly warmed by heat coming from Earth’s depths. Knowing whether Greenland’s ice lies on wet, slippery ground or is anchored to dry, frozen bedrock is essential for predicting how this ice will flow in the future. But scientists have very few direct observations of the thermal conditions beneath the ice sheet, obtained through fewer than two dozen boreholes that have reached the bottom. Now, a new study synthesizes several methods to infer the Greenland Ice Sheet’s basal thermal state — whether the bottom of the ice is melted or not — leading to the first map that identifies frozen and thawed areas across the whole ice sheet. “We’re ultimately interested in understanding how the ice sheet flows and how it will behave in the future,” said Joe MacGregor, lead author of the study and a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “If the ice at its bottom is at the melting-point temperature, or thawed, then there could be enough liquid water there for the ice to flow faster and affect how quickly it responds to climate change.” For this study, published last month in the Journal of Geophysical Research — Earth Surface, MacGregor’s team, which included researcher Helene Seroussi of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, combined four different approaches to investigate the basal thermal state. First, they examined results from eight recent computer models of the ice sheet, which predict bottom temperatures. Second, they studied the layers that compose the ice sheet itself, which are detected by radars onboard NASA’s Operation IceBridge aircraft and suggest where the bottom of the ice is melting rapidly. Third, they looked at where the ice surface speed measured by satellites exceeds its “speed limit,” the maximum velocity at which the ice could flow and still be frozen to the rock beneath it. Fourth, they studied imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers on the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites, looking for rugged surface terrain that is usually indicative of ice sliding over a thawed bed. Seroussi contributed to one of the 3D ice sheet models used in the thermal estimate of basal conditions, using a JPL-developed Ice Sheet System Model. “Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses. Considering just one isn’t enough. By combining them, we produced the first large-scale assessment of Greenland’s basal thermal state,” MacGregor said. For each method, MacGregor’s team looked for areas where the technique confidently inferred that the bed of Greenland’s ice sheet was thawed or frozen. They then looked at the places where these methods agreed and classified these areas as likely thawed or likely frozen. The zones where there was insufficient data or the methods disagreed, they classified as uncertain. From this synthesis, MacGregor and his colleagues determined that the bed is likely thawed under Greenland’s southwestern and northeastern ice drainages, while it’s frozen in the interior and west of the ice sheet’s central ice divide. For a third of the Greenland ice sheet, there’s not enough data available to determine its basal thermal state. MacGregor said the team’s map is just one step in fully assessing the thermal state of the bottom of Greenland’s ice sheet. “I call this the piñata, because it’s a first assessment that is bound to get beat up by other groups as techniques improve or new data are introduced. But that still makes our effort essential, because prior to our study, we had little to pick on,” MacGregor said. Media contact: Alan BuisJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California818-354-",

In an extensive airborne survey, a NASA-led team has analyzed a previously identified \"hot spot\" of methane emissions in the Four Corners region of the United States, quantifying both its overall magnitude and the magnitudes of its sources. The study finds that just 10 percent of the individual methane sources are contributing half of the emissions. Scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech, both in Pasadena, California; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Boulder, Colorado; and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, used two JPL airborne spectrometers to identify and measure more than 250 individual sources of methane. The sources emitted the gas at rates ranging from a few pounds to 11,000 pounds (5,000 kilograms) per hour. Results are published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in a paper titled \"Airborne methane remote measurements reveal heavy-tail flux distribution in Four Corners region.\" Christian Frankenberg of JPL and Caltech is the lead author. As a greenhouse gas, methane is very efficient at trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere, contributing to global warming. In the Four Corners region, where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet, methane emissions are primarily associated with the production and transport of natural gas from coal beds. The odorless, colorless gas is difficult to detect without scientific instruments. The experiment was a proof of concept for airborne detection of methane, according to Frankenberg. \"That we could observe this distribution in a widespread geographical area and collect enough plumes to perform a statistical analysis was a pleasant surprise,\" he said. A group of researchers including Frankenberg originally detected the Four Corners methane hot spot using past observations from a European satellite. Last year, he and JPL colleagues joined a campaign, led and funded by NOAA, to investigate the hot spot, called Twin Otter Projects Defining Oil/gas Well emissioNs (TOPDOWN). The campaign also included researchers from the University of Michigan. Each participating institution deployed its own suite of instruments. The NASA spectrometers used in the study can identify certain atmospheric gases, including methane, by the way the gases absorb sunlight. NOAA provided airborne plume measurements that were used to calibrate and validate the NASA data.

Failed students don’t merely vanish: they become our neighbors, our fellow citizens. They influence society. As a community of scientists and science educators, are they failing us or are we the ones who are failing them? Are we closing the door to people who may bring something creative, are we locking ourselves in? Science-themed videos land in my inbox daily, tagged with notes like “this is great” on products that are boring or unmemorable and have few clicks. It’s not enough for us to pat ourselves on the back for our excellent work; it’s the public that ultimately judges the quality of our products. If you’re presenting a talk and you look at the faces of your audience and their eyes are glazed or they’re texting, then your talk is boring. If your online product isn’t getting thousands of hits then you need to re-evaluate and make changes. You will know if your message resonates in a meaningful way if you get invited back, referred, liked, shared, and remembered. We need to maintain the rigorous content of scientific principles while at the same time engage a broader audience so that the scientific message resonates in a more meaningful way for more people. Having a Ph.D. and doing research is one way to participate in science, but not the only way. Yes, our students and our public must raise the bar on their intellectual capacity, and who wouldn’t want to participate in expanding their brainpower? But it’s us—the scientists, communicators, and educators—who also need to raise our own standards and expand our own capacity to find a way to connect. Thank you for your comments.

Both types of fires are predicted to increase by midcentury, but non-Santa Ana fires are expected to increase more. The research could assist policymakers and response agencies in better allocating firefighting resources in the future. Scientists from three University of California campuses and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, used NASA satellite data and analysis contributed by JPL, along with decades of fire records from the U.S. Forest Service, to characterize the two types of Southern California wildfires. The research is published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. The lead author is Yufang Jin, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, who performed the work while a researcher at the University of California, Irvine. Stoked by dry desert winds channeled through mountain passes and canyons, Santa Ana fires tend to hit more developed areas, hence their disproportionate cost. They burn for shorter periods of time but with more intensity than fires that occur during the comparatively windless months of May through September. In a typical Santa Ana fire, half of the total territory burned is consumed on the first day of the blaze. One example is the costly",

The melt slowed down in June, however, making it highly unlikely that this year’s summertime sea ice minimum extent will set a new record. “Even when it’s likely that we won’t have a record low, the sea ice is not showing any kind of recovery. It’s still in a continued decline over the long term,” said Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It’s just not going to be as extreme as other years because the weather conditions in the Arctic were not as extreme as in other years.” “A decade ago, this year’s sea ice extent would have set a new record low and by a fair amount. Now, we’re kind of used to these low levels of sea ice – it’s the new normal.” This year’s sea ice cover of the Barents and Kara seas north of Russia opened up early, in April, exposing the surface ocean waters to the energy from the sun weeks ahead of schedule. By May 31, the extent of the Arctic sea ice cover was comparable to end-of-June average levels. But the Arctic weather changed in June and slowed the sea ice loss. A persistent area of low atmospheric pressure, accompanied by cloudiness, winds that dispersed ice and lower-than-average temperatures, didn’t favor melt. The rate of ice loss picked up again during the first two weeks of August, and is now greater than average for this time of the year. A strong cyclone is moving through the Arctic, similar to one that occurred in early August",

NASA uses the vantage point of space to study all aspects of Earth as an interconnected system. But there remain significant obstacles to measuring accurately how much water is stored across the planet's snow-covered regions. The amount of water in snow plays a major role in water availability for drinking water, agriculture and hydropower. Enter SnowEx, a NASA-led multi-year research campaign to improve remote-sensing measurements of how much snow is on the ground at any given time and how much water is contained in that snow. SnowEx is sponsored by the Terrestrial Hydrology Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The first year of the ground and air campaign takes place in February in western Colorado. “This is the most comprehensive campaign we have ever done on snow,\" said Edward Kim, a remote sensing scientist at NASA Goddard and the SnowEx project scientist. “An army of nearly 100 scientists from universities and agencies across the U.S., Europe and Canada are participating. Our goal is to find and refine the best snow-measuring techniques and how they could work together.” Scientists know that they will need multiple sensors to measure the water content in snow. “No one instrument is perfect,” said Charles Gatebe from NASA Goddard, SnowEx deputy project scientist and senior scientist with Universities Space Research Association. “One of our biggest problems is detecting snow through trees. We will work closely with our ground team to try new techniques to see if we can figure out how to do that accurately.” More than one-sixth of the world’s population relies on seasonal snow for water. In the western U.S., nearly three-quarters of the annual streamflow that provides the water supply arrives as spring and summer melt from the mountain snow packs. Right now, predictions of streamflow can vary widely due to limited ground measurement sites. This is one of the reasons scientists and resource managers are interested in a comprehensive view from space of what they call snow-water equivalent — the amount of liquid water contained in snow cover. Scientists use snow-water equivalent to estimate the amount of water that will melt into mountain streams, rivers and reservoirs. Snow also effects and is affected by the climate. Scientists have detected changes in snow quantity and snowmelt timing that track with other changes prompted by Earth's warming climate. While satellites are not able to measure snow-water equivalent accurately over all snowy landscapes, satellites have monitored the extent of seasonal snow-covered areas for decades. Since",

    "content": "3 min read A NASA-led team of scientists has developed the first-ever method for detecting the presence of different types of underground forest fungi from space, information that may help researchers predict how climate change will alter forest habitats. Hidden beneath every forest is a network of fungi living in mutually beneficial relationships with the trees. Called mycorrhizal fungi, these organisms spread underground for miles, scavenging for nutrients that they trade with trees for sugars the trees make during photosynthesis. “Nearly all tree species associate with only one of two types of mycorrhizal fungi,” explained coauthor Richard Phillips of Indiana University, Bloomington. Because the two types of fungi are expected to respond differently to a changing climate, knowing where each type predominates may help scientists predict where forests will thrive in the future and where they will falter. Creating maps of forests and their fungi has traditionally relied on various methods of counting individual tree species, an approach that cannot be done at large scales. In a new study published in the journal Global Change Biology, a team led by Joshua Fisher of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and UCLA found a way to detect this hidden network using satellite images. Every tree species has its own spectral signature — it absorbs or reflects light in a specific pattern across all the wavelengths in the spectrum of light. Using satellite images of forest canopies, Fisher's group probed whether they could identify any patterns in the spectral signatures of tree species associated with one type of fungus that did not appear in species associated with the other type. Fisher explained, \"Individual tree species have unique spectral fingerprints, but we thought the underlying fungi could be controlling them as groups.” The team studied images of four U.S. forest research plots that are part of the Smithsonian Institution’s Forest Global Earth Observatory. In these forests, which include 130,000 trees across 77 species, the tree species associated with each type of fungus had already been mapped from the ground. The researchers analyzed images of the forest canopies taken by the NASA/U.S. Geological Survey Landsat-5 satellite from",

Credit: NASA. After years of work, a team of NASA scientists and engineers is poised to realize a lifetime goal: building an instrument powerful and accurate enough to gather around-the-clock global atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2) measurements from space. The instrument, called the CO2 Sounder Lidar, is a strong contender for a potential next-generation carbon-monitoring mission, the Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons, or ASCENDS. Although the scientific community supports such a mission, scientists say its development depends on whether the National Research Council endorses the mission in its next Earth Science Decadal Survey, which represents a consensus of the most important research areas and the order in which they should be built. Furthermore, the technology must be mature enough to measure the greenhouse gas with needed and unprecedented precision and resolution, regardless of the season or time of day, scientists say. Engineers and scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, believe they can make the case for the technology — especially now that they’ve analyzed data gathered during the instrument’s most recent aircraft campaign over California and Nevada earlier this year. The team, led by Goddard scientist Jim Abshire, presented these results at the International Workshop on Greenhouse Gas Measurements from Space in Kyoto, Japan, in early June. The team’s work began about a decade ago with funding from Goddard’s Internal Research and Development program and later with support from NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office. The lidar operates by bouncing an infrared laser light off the Earth’s surface. Like all atmospheric gases, carbon dioxide absorbs light in narrow wavelength bands — in this case, the infrared. By tuning the laser to the infrared, scientists can detect and then analyze the level of carbon dioxide in that vertical path. The more gas along the light’s path, the deeper the absorption lines. Recent data analyses indicated that the CO2 Sounder can execute its job faster and with greater accuracy than earlier incarnations of the instrument. Team members attribute their success to several key technologies. For one, the lidar is equipped with the world’s first solid-state detector that is highly sensitive to the near and mid-infrared wavelengths — a spectral sweet spot for detecting greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Made of a special alloy called mercury-cadmium-telluride, this breakthrough detector can effectively count each returning infrared photon, and as a result, enjoys unparalleled sensitivity. “During the CO2 Sounder’s",

Instead, it wound up helping a very small technology company to thrive. Here’s what happened. Aerospace mega-giant Boeing approached NASA with the idea of using fuel cells to provide electricity for its planes instead of the onboard generators commonly in use. Those generators run on the same jet fuel that powers a plane’s flight, but burning jet fuel to drive a small generator is inefficient. If a small, lightweight system were developed to extract hydrogen and carbon monoxide from the jet fuel (a process known as “reforming”) and use those gases in a solid-oxide fuel cell, much less jet fuel would be required to generate the same amount of electricity—a win-win for Boeing (which would save money on fuel) and the environment (which would see less carbon dioxide blown into the atmosphere).

Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. NASA begins a five-year study this month of the annual cycle of phytoplankton and the impact that small airborne particles emitted from the ocean have on the climate-sensitive North Atlantic. The North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) will collect data during ship and aircraft measurement campaigns and combine that data with continuous satellite and ocean sensor readings. The first of four seasonal research missions begins Nov. 6 and continues through early December. NASA’s C-130H Hercules airborne laboratory will begin research flights Nov. 12 from St. John’s International Airport in St. John’s, Newfoundland. The flights will be coordinated with the research vessel (R/V) Atlantis, operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Atlantis will provide detailed ship-based measurements of plankton in the North Atlantic. “We will be studying an ocean region that every year exhibits one of the largest natural phytoplankton blooms on Earth,” said Mike Behrenfeld, NAAMES principal investigator from Oregon State University in Corvallis. “These plankton are also known to release organic compounds into the atmosphere that can be measured as far away as Ireland. That makes the North Atlantic an ideal place to study how plankton blooms are recreated each year by ecological and physical processes, and how ocean biology is involved in the sea-air exchange of organic aerosols and trace gases that may influence clouds and climate.” The C-130H will fly eastward to rendezvous with and overfly the global-class, floating laboratory-ship Atlantis during its approximately 26-day research cruise. By combining ship, airborne, computer modeling, sustained satellite and autonomous sensor data, scientists hope to improve their predictions of ecosystem and aerosol changes in a warming ocean. Plankton ecosystems in the ocean are strongly interconnected with climate and life on Earth. Plankton production, responding to a warming climate, results in environmental impacts such as changes in fisheries production, uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and ocean emissions of climate-regulating aerosols. The ability to predict the consequences of a warming ocean depends on resolving conflicting theories about what controls plankton ecosystems and their aerosol emissions. NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, has science and project management responsibilities for NAAMES and science instruments onboard the C-130H. The agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, leads project data management. The NAAMES ship and airborne science-instrument teams involve more than 20 different research facilities and academic institutions. NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility Aircraft Office in Virginia operates the C-130H research aircraft to support airborne scientific research activities. The NASA C-130H and the R/V Atlantis supporting the NAAMES mission will be available to the media at two different events this month. On Wednesday, Nov. 4 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. EST, media can tour the Atlantis at Woods Hole, located at 86 Water St. The C-130H will be available on Tuesday, Nov. 10 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Newfoundland Time Zone, in Hangar #4 of St. John’s International Airport, located at RCAF Road in St. John’s.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, who hosted a public comment forum that I attended last week at the University of Southern California (USC) for the recently drafted National Climate Assessment Report. The report focuses on climate change’s projected impacts on the U.S., and this forum brought attention to the Southwest (our country's hottest and driest region). As I sat amongst a suit-wearing, predominantly male audience, the atmosphere felt somewhat stiff. But the Governator’s quip seemed to put us at ease before we began to absorb the findings on this serious, life-threatening matter. The chairman of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute (in partnership with the USC Center for Sustainable Cities) likened the report to a doctor’s yearly physical—only the doctors, in this case, are climate researchers. “The National Climate Assessment is our physical,” he said, underscoring the need to listen to expert diagnoses before the country has its own “heart attack.” The “doctors” at the April 8 forum covered many critical issues. The quantity of information was overwhelming at times, but here were a few predictions that stood out. For example, if we continue at the current emissions rate: Furthermore, I’m guessing prospects for the land of golden opportunities (or, as The Governator calls it, “Cah-lee-for-nee-uh”) were particularly interesting to the room, not only because it’s our home, but also because of our state's gargantuan economy. Here are two examples of what could happen to California: These are just some examples of the probable forthcoming damage. By the end of the talk, a part of me wanted to bury my head in sand to cease listening to these grueling findings. But on the flip side, I knew that wouldn’t do me—or anyone on this majestic planet—any good. I listened to the commentators from political, private, scientific, and academic (students and professors) backgrounds, and their views often aligned with what The Governator implied: If we don’t take care of ourselves and our planet by following expert advice, we could end up in an irreversible situation. It’s simple wisdom, and I got the vibe that many were willing to move forward to help avoid those worst-case scenarios.

    "date": null,
    "content": "4 min read Digital measurements of millions of trees indicate that previous studies likely overestimate the amount of carbon stored by temperate U.S. forests, according to a new NASA study. The findings could help scientists better understand the impact that trees have on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Although it is a well-established fact that trees absorb carbon and store it long-term, researchers are unsure how much is stored in global forests. “Estimates of the carbon content of living trees typically rely on a method that is based on cutting down trees,” said Laura Duncanson, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It takes a lot of effort to cut down trees, particularly the biggest ones, so this just isn’t practical to do in large numbers.” Because of this limitation, field studies aim to strategically sample trees. When looking at U.S. forests, for example, on average about 30 trees of each species would be cut down and measured. Researchers would then use basic mathematical models to scale up those measurements to many thousands, or even millions, of trees, resulting in an estimate of the biomass – the amount of carbon stored – for an entire forest. In the paper, published on Nov. 24 in Scientific Reports, Duncanson and her co-investigators, Ralph Dubayah and Oliver Rourke, both from the University of Maryland, College Park, found that this widely used method tends to overestimate the height of large trees, leading to biomass figures that are much too high for temperate forests. This overestimation occurs because of a sampling bias: many more young, smaller trees get selected for analysis than older, larger trees. Because the mathematical models that predict tree biomass are mostly based on the smaller trees, the resulting models do not make accurate predictions for the largest trees. Instead of sampling trees by cutting them down, the new study used lidar, a laser-based technique that can analyze whole swaths of forest from above. The data were provided primarily by Goddard’s Lidar, Hyperspectral and Thermal instrument, known as G-LiHT. This portable lidar can be flown on an aircraft to provide fine-scale observations with a resolution of less than 3.3 feet (1 meter) over large areas. “One of the innovations of this work is our use of lidar remote sensing to measure potentially millions of trees,” said Dubayah, a professor of geographical sciences. “This is a dramatically different approach when you consider how few trees are normally used to develop these relationships.” From the lidar data, the researchers extracted digital measurements of the height and crown radius – the average horizontal spread of the limbs – for every tree selected. The team studied six U.S. forests, digitally measuring 10,000 to more than a million trees at each site. These measurements were used to develop new mathematical models to estimate the biomass of the forests. Next, the researchers reran the models using only a sampling of the measurements – starting with tens of trees and going up to a few thousand. Including more trees led to better estimates, primarily because more large trees were accounted for. The team determined that when the small sample sizes typical of the conventional approach were used, the figures overestimated the inferred biomass of temperate forests by 70 percent, on average. The bias that results from sampling small numbers of trees has been well studied in tropical forests. Even so, the researchers were surprised to discover the magnitude of the issue for temperate forests. “Our findings underscore the importance of sampling more trees,” said Duncanson. “When you include more trees, and especially more big trees, you get a much better idea of how much carbon is being stored.” New lidar instruments are being developed to help study the biomass of forests, including NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, or GEDI, an instrument led by Dubayah and being built at Goddard. GEDI will be the first instrument to systematically characterize forest canopies from space. “GEDI will help fill in this missing piece of the carbon puzzle by measuring the vertical structure of the forest, which is information we cannot get with sufficient accuracy any other way,” said Dubayah.

    "content": "5 min read Using satellite data on how water moves around Earth, NASA scientists have solved two mysteries about wobbles in the planet's rotation — one new and one more than a century old. The research may help improve our knowledge of past and future climate. Although a desktop globe always spins smoothly around the axis running through its north and south poles, a real planet wobbles. Earth’s spin axis drifts slowly around the poles; the farthest away it has wobbled since observations began is 37 feet (12 meters). These wobbles don’t affect our daily life, but they must be taken into account to get accurate results from GPS, Earth-observing satellites and observatories on the ground. In a paper published today in Science Advances, Surendra Adhikari and Erik Ivins of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, researched how the movement of water around the world contributes to Earth's rotational wobbles. Earlier studies have pinpointed many connections between processes on Earth's surface or interior and our planet's wandering ways. For example, Earth's mantle is still readjusting to the loss of ice on North America after the last ice age, and the reduced mass beneath that continent pulls the spin axis toward Canada at the rate of a few inches each year. But some motions are still puzzling. Around the year",

Climate change is rapidly warming lakes around the world, threatening freshwater supplies and ecosystems, according to a new NASA and National Science Foundation-funded study of more than half of the world's freshwater supply. Using more than 25 years of satellite temperature data and ground measurements of 235 lakes on six continents, this study — the largest of its kind — found lakes are warming an average of 0.61 degrees Fahrenheit (0.34 degrees Celsius) each decade. The scientists say this is greater than the warming rate of either the ocean or the atmosphere, and it can have profound effects. The research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, was announced Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.

Credit: Illinois State University/USGS/California University of Pennsylvania. As warming rates increase over the next century, algal blooms, which can rob water of oxygen, are projected to increase 20 percent in lakes. Algal blooms that are toxic to fish and animals are expected to increase by 5 percent. Emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on 100-year time scales, will increase 4 percent over the next decade, if these rates continue. \"Society depends on surface water for the vast majority of human uses,\" said co-author Stephanie Hampton, director of Washington State University's Center for Environmental Research, Education and Outreach in Pullman. \"Not just for drinking water, but manufacturing, for energy production, for irrigation of our crops. Protein from freshwater fish is especially important in the developing world.\" Water temperature influences a host of its other properties critical to the health and viability of ecosystems. When temperatures swing quickly and widely from the norm, life forms in a lake can change dramatically and even disappear. \"These results suggest that large changes in our lakes are not only unavoidable, but are probably already happening,\" said lead author Catherine O'Reilly, associate professor of geology at Illinois State University, Normal. Earlier research by O'Reilly has seen declining productivity in lakes with rising temperatures. Study co-author Simon Hook, science division manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said satellite measurements provide a broad view of lake temperatures over the entire globe. But they only measure surface temperature, while ground measurements can detect temperature changes throughout a lake. Also, while satellite measurements go back 30 years, some lake measurements go back more than a century. \"Combining the ground and satellite measurements provides the most comprehensive view of how lake temperatures are changing around the world,\" he said.

The inset image of Lake Tahoe, from the ASTER instrument on Terra, shows the lake's temperature variations (cold is blue, warm is red). Credit: NASA. The researchers said various climate factors are associated with the warming trend. In northern climates, lakes are losing their ice cover earlier in the spring and many areas of the world have less cloud cover, exposing their waters more to the sun's warming rays. Previous work by Hook, using satellite data, indicated many lake temperatures were warming faster than air temperature and that the greatest warming was observed at high latitudes, as seen in other climate warming studies. This new research confirmed those observations, with average warming rates of 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit (0.72 degrees Celsius) per decade at high latitudes. Warm-water tropical lakes may be seeing less dramatic temperature increases, but increased warming of these lakes still can have significant negative impacts on fish. That can be particularly important in the African Great Lakes, where fish are a major source of food. \"We want to be careful that we don't dismiss some of these lower rates of change,\" said Hampton. \"In warmer lakes, those temperature changes can be really important. They can be just as important as a higher rate of change in a cooler lake.\" In general, the researchers write, \"The pervasive and rapid warming observed here signals the urgent need to incorporate climate impacts into vulnerability assessments and adaptation efforts for lakes.\" For more information about NASA's Earth science activities, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/earth Alan Buis Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-",

    "content": "From NASA Earth's atmosphere viewed from the International Space Station. A NASA/Duke University study provides new evidence that natural cycles alone aren't sufficient to explain the global atmospheric warming observed over the last century. Credit: NASA. A study by scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, shows, in detail, the reason why global temperatures remain stable in the long run unless they are pushed by outside forces, such as increased greenhouse gases due to human impacts. Lead author Patrick Brown, a doctoral student at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment, and his JPL colleagues combined global climate models with satellite measurements of changes in the energy approaching and leaving Earth at the top of the atmosphere over the past 15 years. The satellite data were from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments on NASA’s Aqua and Terra spacecraft. Their work reveals in new detail how Earth cools itself back down after a period of natural warming. Scientists have long known that as Earth warms, it is able to restore its temperature equilibrium through a phenomenon known as the Planck Response. The phenomenon is an overall increase in infrared energy that Earth emits as it warms. The response acts as a safety valve of sorts, allowing more of the accumulating heat to be released through the top of Earth's atmosphere into space. The new research, however, shows it’s not quite as simple as that. “Our analysis confirmed that the Planck Response plays the dominant role in restoring global temperature stability, but to our surprise, we found that it tends to be overwhelmed locally by heat-trapping changes in clouds, water vapor, and snow and ice,” Brown said. “This initially suggested that the climate system might be able to create large, sustained changes in temperature all by itself.” A more detailed investigation of the satellite observations and climate models helped the researchers finally reconcile what was happening globally versus locally. “While global temperature tends to be stable due to the Planck Response, there are other important, previously less appreciated, mechanisms at work, too,” said Wenhong Li, assistant professor of climate at Duke. These mechanisms include the net release of energy over anomalously cool regions and the transport of energy to continental and polar regions. In those regions, the Planck Response overwhelms positive, heat-trapping local energy feedbacks. “This emphasizes the importance of large-scale energy transport and atmospheric circulation changes in reconciling local versus global energy feedbacks and, in the absence of external drivers, restoring Earth’s global temperature equilibrium,” Li said. The researchers say the findings may finally help put the chill on skeptics’ belief that long-term global warming occurs in an unpredictable manner, independently of external drivers such as human impacts. “This study underscores that large, sustained changes in global temperature like those observed over the last century require drivers such as increased greenhouse gas concentrations,” said Brown. “Scientists have long believed that increasing greenhouse gases played a major role in determining the warming trend of our planet,” added JPL co-author Jonathan Jiang. “This study provides further evidence that natural climate cycles alone are insufficient to explain the global warming observed over the last century.” The research is published this month in the Journal of Climate.

Since this El Niño began last summer, the Pacific Ocean has already experienced an increase in tropical storms and a decrease in phytoplankton. El Niño is an irregularly occurring weather phenomenon created through an abnormality in wind and ocean circulation. While it originates in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, El Niño has wide-reaching effects. In a global context, it affects rainfall, ocean productivity, atmospheric gases and winds across continents.

A new three-year NASA field expedition gets underway this year that will use advanced instruments on airplanes and in the water to survey more of the world’s coral reefs, and in far greater detail, than ever before. The COral Reef Airborne Laboratory (CORAL) will measure the condition of these threatened ecosystems and create a unique database of uniform scale and quality. Coral reefs, sometimes called the rainforests of the sea, are home to a quarter of all ocean fish species. They protect shorelines from storms and provide food for millions of people, yet very little of the world's reef area has been studied scientifically. Virtually all measurements have been made by expensive, labor-intensive diving expeditions. Many reefs have never been surveyed, and those that have been studied were measured at only a few dive sites. \"Right now, the state of the art for collecting coral reef data is scuba diving with a tape measure,\" said Eric Hochberg, CORAL principal investigator and scientist at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, St. George's. \"It's analogous to looking at a few trees and then trying to say what the forest is doing.\" Hochberg’s team will survey the condition of entire reef systems in Florida, Hawaii, Palau, the Mariana Islands and Australia. CORAL will use an airborne instrument called the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM), developed and managed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Concurrent in-water measurements will validate the airborne measurements of reef condition. In turn, reef condition will be analyzed in the context of the prevailing environment, including physical, chemical and human factors. The results will reveal how the environment shapes reef ecosystems. Reefs worldwide are threatened by human impacts and climate change. The limited observations made to date suggest that 33 to 50 percent of our planet’s coral reefs have been significantly degraded or lost, and the concern among reef scientists is that most functioning reef ecosystems will disappear by mid-century. \"We know reefs are in trouble,\" Hochberg said. \"We've seen the reefs of Jamaica and Florida deteriorate and we think we know what is happening there. However, reefs respond in complex ways to environmental stresses such as sea level change, rising ocean temperatures and pollution. The available data were not collected at the appropriate spatial scale and density to allow us to develop an overarching, quantitative model that describes why and how reefs change in response to environmental changes. We need accurate data across many whole reef ecosystems to do that.\" According to Michelle Gierach, the CORAL project scientist at JPL, PRISM was specifically created for remote sensing of coastal and inland waters. PRISM records the spectra of light reflected upward toward the instrument from the ocean below, allowing researchers to pick out the unique spectral signatures of living corals and algae. As corals die, algae increase on a reef, so the ratio of coral to algae is an indicator of the ecosystem's health. \"Now, estimates of global reef status are synthesized from local surveys with disparate aims, methods and quality,\" Gierach said. \"With CORAL, we will provide not only the most extensive picture to date of the condition of a large portion of the world's coral reefs, but a uniform dataset, as well.” JPL is providing engineering support and management for CORAL’s airborne campaigns under project manager Ian McCubbin.

    "content": "4 min read From a dusty atmosphere stretching across the Atlantic Ocean to daily views of clouds at sunrise, a new NASA camera keeping a steady eye on the sunlit side of Earth is yielding new insights about our changing planet. With NASA’s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), affixed to NOAA’s Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) about one million miles from Earth, scientists are getting a new view of our planet’s clouds, land surfaces, aerosols and more. Science results from the first EPIC images were discussed Monday at a media briefing at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. EPIC captures a color image of the sunlit side of Earth at least once every two hours, allowing researchers to track features as the planet rotates in the instrument’s field of view. “With EPIC, you see cloud structure from sunrise on the left to sunset on the right,” said Jay Herman, EPIC instrument lead investigator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “It’s the only view we have like this where everything is at the exact same instant in time, even though the local times are different.” EPIC takes measurements in visible, ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths. With the ultraviolet channels, Herman can watch as dust from the Sahara travels westward across the Atlantic. While other low-Earth orbit satellite instruments can pick this up as they orbit at a fixed local time, EPIC provides a day-long view of the process. “We can see the progression in real time, as it flows across the Atlantic,” Herman said. Researchers also can determine the height and location of daytime clouds by comparing EPIC images at two different wavelengths. This measurement is important in calculating Earth’s energy balance for climate studies, as well as for tracking weather. For example, hurricanes show up as a high spiral of clouds surrounding a clearly visible eye. “Because of the unique location and field of view, every day brings something new and unexpected,” said Alexander Marshak, DSCOVR deputy project scientist at Goddard. One example Marshak points out is that, even a million miles away, EPIC can see the tracks of ships crossing the ocean. Some of the first images from EPIC show the clouds that result from the ships’ smoke plumes. Researchers also are analyzing EPIC data to better understand vegetation, aerosols, ozone and other features of Earth and its atmosphere. DSCOVR was launched on Feb. 11 and, after a four-month journey, reached its orbit around the first Lagrange point, where the matching pull of gravity from the sun and Earth allows the satellite to stay relatively stable between the two bodies. The satellite, a joint mission between NOAA, NASA and the U.S. Air Force, also carries instruments facing the sun that will the study solar wind and its magnetic field. A second NASA Earth-facing instrument on DSCOVR, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR), measures the total amount of solar energy that reflects off Earth, as well as the heat emitted from our planet, according to Steven Lorentz, NISTAR instrument lead investigator and president of L-1 Standards and Technology, Inc. Because of this, the instrument fills in a missing piece of energy information not observed by other satellites. Even with less than a year’s worth of data, the energy reflected off Earth is showing patterns, he said. The instrument picks up fluctuations, with more light reflected from continents and clouds than from oceans. “Whenever Africa is in view, we get the highest photoreflectance,” Lorentz said. “And, even though it’s the same planet spinning, the amount of cloudiness varies planet-wide every day.” Earth’s reflectiveness varies throughout the year, as well. As Antarctica tilts towards the sun in November, NISTAR’s signal edges up as the massive ice sheet changes the planet’s energy budget. It’s a measurement that, over time, could help scientists studying how the reflectance of the sun’s energy back into space can impact Earth’s changing climate.

A team of scientists has launched a series of research flights over the remote seas surrounding Antarctica in an effort to better understand how much carbon dioxide the icy waters are able to lock away. Called ORCAS, the field campaign will provide a rare look at how oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the air and the Southern Ocean. The campaign is led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Michelle Gierach of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, is a principal investigator, along with other scientists from a range of universities and research institutions. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas contributing to human-caused climate change. As more carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, the ocean has stepped up the amount of the gas it absorbs from the air. But it's unclear whether the ocean can keep pace with continued emissions. Previous studies have disagreed about whether the Southern Ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide is speeding up or slowing down. The measurements and air samples collected by ORCAS — which stands for the O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study — will give scientists critical data to help clarify what's happening in the remote region. The researchers plan to make 14 flights out of Punta Arenas, Chile, across parts of the Southern Ocean during the campaign, which ends Feb. 28. A suite of instruments will measure the distribution of oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as other gases produced by marine microorganisms, microscopic airborne particles and clouds. The flights also will observe ocean color — which can indicate how much and what type of phytoplankton is in the water — using NASA's Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM). The scientists hope that adding these other measurements to the carbon dioxide data will give them new insight on chemical, physical and biological processes that are affecting the ocean's ability to absorb the greenhouse gas. \"The Southern Ocean is very inaccessible, and existing measurements represent only a few tiny dots on a huge map,\" said NCAR's Britton Stephens, co-lead principal investigator for ORCAS. \"Understanding the Southern Ocean's role is important, because ocean circulation there provides a major opportunity for the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the vast reservoir of the deep ocean.\" For more information about ORCAS: http://bitly.com/orcasresearch For more information about NASA's Earth science activities, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/earth Alan Buis Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California 818-354-",

    "content": "4 min read Extreme weather predictions on the West Coast could become more accurate with help from NASA's remotely piloted Global Hawk. Flights to look at Pacific storms as they develop began Feb. 12. The mission will show how Global Hawk could augment satellites and routinely fly vast areas of the ocean, said Robbie Hood, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Unmanned Aircraft Systems program. \"How do you use Global Hawks and actually chase storms?\" Hood asked. \"That's what we are looking at with these missions.\" NOAA, NASA and the National Weather Service are partnering on an El Niño field research campaign \"to get data in the hands of forecasters and for our weather models,\" said Robert Webb, Physical Science Division director of the Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research for NOAA. Webb and a panel of experts from NASA, NOAA and the National Weather Service detailed elements of the campaign at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in California Feb. 5. The observation flights are part of an ongoing NOAA mission called Sensing Hazards with Operational Unmanned Technology, or SHOUT. SHOUT is a multi-year mission to show how the use of autonomous vehicles can fill in gaps in weather modeling and as a potential backup in case a satellite is unable to capture data. This SHOUT mission is being conducted in collaboration with NOAA's larger El Niño Rapid Response Field campaign. In addition to the Global Hawk, NOAA also is using a Gulfstream IV research plane and the NOAA ship Ronald H. Brown. El Niño is a recurring climate phenomenon, characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, which increases the odds for warm and dry winters across the Northern United States and cool, wet winters across the South. Based at NASA Armstrong, the Global Hawk is scheduled to fly four to six, 24-hour flights in February at 60,000 feet altitude. The aircraft is expected to provide detailed meteorological measurements from a region in the Pacific that is known to be the origin point of El Niño storms and particularly critical for interactions linked to West Coast storms and rainfall. The Global Hawk can help fill a void over the Pacific Ocean that other assets, like satellites, cannot easily study, especially in the upper atmosphere where clouds can obscure observations, Webb said. \"It gives us a chance to really get ahead of the storm,\" he added. Some of that data is collected through the use of tools resembling paper towel tubes called dropsondes. These devices are dropped from the Global Hawk into the weather to gather temperature, moisture and wind speed and direction, Webb said. Also onboard the Global Hawk is the High Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP) instrument, operated and managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and the High Altitude MMIC Sounding Radiometer (HAMSR) instrument, managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The instruments will collect remote observations of the area, producing data similar to satellite observations. The final instrument, NOAA-O3, will measure ozone at the altitude the aircraft is flying. Doppler radar is also used to track wind speed and direction. \"Every place the Global Hawk flies is like a layer cake and we see how it stacks up,\" Hood said. \"The data can be cross referenced and map areas in and around the storm, and we can watch how it develops. We are interested in understanding the data that can improve our ability to predict extreme weather.\" Gary Wick, lead NOAA scientist for the SHOUT mission, said the long-endurance flights provide information over a large area of the ocean like satellites do, but with greater resolution because the instruments are that much closer to the weather. \"The SHOUT campaign will provide unprecedented information that will improve hurricane predictions and add to weather models in areas of prediction that the models just don't get right,\" said Jason Sippel, a National Weather Service scientist. Frank Cutler, the Armstrong Global Hawk project manager, said NASA Armstrong's role extends beyond providing the aircraft. Armstrong staff members are responsible for integrating the instruments into the aircraft, planning the missions as directed by the science team and then flying those missions. Although the aircraft is autonomous, the Global Hawk can be sent instructions in flight to alter course to better observe items of interest based on changing conditions and \"complete the mission with a perfect landing every time,\" Cutler explained. As the current El Nino situation evolves, the Global Hawk will help determine what the storms look like and provide information for models to help better predict how the big storms develop.

    "date": null,
    "content": "4 min read New measurements from a NASA satellite have allowed researchers to identify and quantify, for the first time, how climate-driven increases of liquid water storage on land have affected the rate of sea level rise. A new study by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the University of California, Irvine, shows that while ice sheets and glaciers continue to melt, changes in weather and climate over the past decade have caused Earth’s continents to soak up and store an extra 3.2 trillion tons of water in soils, lakes and underground aquifers, temporarily slowing the rate of sea level rise by about 20 percent. The water gains over land were spread globally, but taken together they equal the volume of Lake Huron, the world’s seventh largest lake. The study is published in the Feb. 12 issue of the journal Science. Each year, a large amount of water evaporates from the ocean, falls over land as rain or snow, and returns to the ocean through runoff and river flows. This is known as the global hydrologic, or water, cycle. Scientists have long known small changes in the hydrologic cycle — by persistent regional changes in soil moisture or lake levels, for instance — could change the rate of sea level rise from what we would expect based on ice sheet and glacier melt rates. However, they did not know how large the land storage effect would be because there were no instruments that could accurately measure global changes in liquid water on land. \"We always assumed that people’s increased reliance on groundwater for irrigation and consumption was resulting in a net transfer of water from the land to the ocean,” said lead author J.T. Reager of JPL, who began work on the study as a graduate student at UC Irvine. \"What we didn’t realize until now is that over the past decade, changes in the global water cycle more than offset the losses that occurred from groundwater pumping, causing the land to act like a sponge — at least temporarily. “These new data are vital for understanding decadal variations in sea level change,” Reager added. “The information will be a critical complement to future long-term projections of sea level rise, which depend on melting ice and warming oceans.” The",

    "content": "From NASA An illustration of RainCube, enabling precipitation observations from space in a CubeSat platform. Credit: RainCube team. Sometimes we need to leave our home planet to better understand it. Before Earth observing missions launch, NASA must verify instruments onboard will work as expected. This is not always an easy task when space presents such a different environment than Earth. But thanks to CubeSats, cube-shaped satellites that can be small enough to fit in the palm of your hand or as big as a large shoebox, testing new technologies in space is easer than ever. To take advantage of the space-bound opportunities these small satellites offer, the Earth Science Technology office, or ESTO, part of NASA’s Earth Science Division, has selected four new projects to be developed, built, and launched into low-Earth orbit to test emerging technologies that could enable new and improved understandings of the planet. Gathering high-accuracy, timely measurements is key to achieving NASA’s science goals. “Most Earth science phenomena measurements can be improved by sustained observations with increased spatial and temporal resolution. Validating these new compact instrument subsystems today will enable the relevant constellation measurements of the future,” said ESTO program associate Charles Norton of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech. The four new InVEST CubeSat selections are: (CubeRRT) – Joel Johnson, of The Ohio State University, will lead the development of CubeRRT, a project to observe, detect, and mitigate radio frequency interference (RFI) for microwave radiometers, an instrument that measures Earth’s properties, including atmospheric water vapor or soil moisture. RFI is a growing problem in radiometry due to increasing demand for use on the spectrum for communications. If successful, CubeRRT technologies will address gaps in existing RFI mitigation technologies to increase the amount of high quality radiometer data collected by future Earth observing missions. Compact Infrared Radiometer in Space (CIRiS) – CIRiS, led by David Osterman, of Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation, will adapt an existing instrument to be CubeSat compatible to validate instrument performance in low-Earth orbit. The CIRiS mission will also validate data processing algorithms as well as on-orbit instrument calibration – important for enabling new instruments that could be used in a variety of missions, including future Landsats. Multiple CIRiS satellites flying in formation could replace larger or more complex instruments and satellites. The data collected could be used for land and water resource management, research, and modeling CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) – Thomas Pagano of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is leading the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) project. CIRAS is designed to develop a CubeSat-size instrument system capable of matching the temperature and water vapor profile measurements in the lower troposphere of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, or AIRS, instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite and the Cross Track Infrared Sounder, or CrIS, instrument on the NASA/NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System. In the future, constellations of CIRAS satellites could improve the timeliness and resolution of critical infrared sounding data to improve weather forecasting and support research in the areas of severe weather and climate. Precipitation Profiling Radar in a CubeSat (RainCube) – RainCube, led by Eva Peral, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will be the first active radar on a CubeSat platform. It will use a very compact deployable antenna and new processing technologies to validate a Ka-band precipitation radar. A constellation of RainCube satellites would be able to provide the temporal resolution for weather observations that could be used to improve forecasting models. These quick-turnaround projects, once validated, have the potential to improve and supplement Earth science observations available to researchers worldwide covering topics from weather to climate, and soil moisture to land use. Small satellites, including CubeSats, are playing an increasingly larger role in exploration, technology demonstration, scientific research and educational investigations at NASA. These miniature satellites provide a low-cost platform for NASA missions, including planetary space exploration, Earth observations, fundamental Earth and space science, and developing precursor science instruments like cutting-edge laser communications, satellite-to-satellite communications and autonomous movement capabilities. The four newly-selected CubeSats, each measuring 10x20x30 centimeters, received funding through a recent solicitation held by NASA’s In-Space Validation of Earth Science Technologies, or InVEST, program managed by Pamela Millar of ESTO. The total funding for these four projects over their first year of development is approximately nine million dollars. Each satellite is scheduled to be built and launched in approximately two to three years and should be operational in space for anywhere from three to twelve months. The InVEST program, managed by ESTO, focuses on the challenges of space-based Earth observations and demonstrates and provides technologies from instruments and components to information systems that can be used on a variety of platforms and can be reliably applied to a broad range of Earth science measurement and mission needs.

The first deployment of one of NASA's most ambitious research studies of Earth's atmosphere will take place this July and August. The Atmospheric Tomography mission will take off aboard the agency's DC-8 flying laboratory on a 26-day journey from the North Pole down the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand and then across to the tip of South America and back north up the Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic. The airborne mission will complement NASA's current satellite-based efforts to monitor and understand the major gases of Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and ozone. In addition to validating space observations, the Atmospheric Tomography mission, called ATom for short, will zoom in to make the finely detailed measurements of atmospheric chemistry that are difficult or impossible to make from orbit. \"The best way to study the atmosphere is to fly through and measure as much of it as we can,\" said Dave Jordan, project manager at NASA's Ames Flight Research Center. The mission will measure more than 200 gases as well as airborne particles in the atmosphere over the oceans. The science team is trying to understand how greenhouse gases such as methane and ozone, and poorly understood airborne particles such as black carbon, enter, transform and ultimately are removed from the atmosphere – processes essential for understanding Earth's climate today and in the future. With the burning of fossil fuels and the release of industrial pollutants, \"we have changed the composition of the atmosphere in ways that people never imagined,\" said Steven Wofsy, an atmospheric scientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and ATom's project scientist. \"We're going to look at the chemistry of the far reaches of the global environment, in painstaking detail and really get a level of understanding that we've never been able to have before about how human impact is affecting the atmosphere in these most remote reaches.\" The remote reaches make up the bulk of our atmosphere and are located over the oceans, far from sources human pollution. That is where scientists may expect to find the \"normal\" atmosphere, where human impacts are minimized by distance and the dilution of pollutants. One of the key questions Wofsy and his colleagues are investigating is how much of the atmospheric chemistry is \"normal\" and how much is influenced by distant pollution sources. Of primary interest are methane and tropospheric ozone, two greenhouse gases that linger in the atmosphere for weeks to decades—much less time than the century that carbon dioxide remains in the air. Nevertheless, the short-term effects of methane and ozone pollution today are expected to contribute almost as much as carbon dioxide to changing the climate in the coming decades. \"We want to understand methane’s lifetime,\" said Paul Newman, chief scientist of Earth science at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and co-leader of the ATom science team. While methane has been well studied, questions remain about how it is removed from the atmosphere. \"If you release a methane molecule here at the surface in North America, how long does it last in the atmosphere? What are the gases that control the levels of methane?\" The loss of methane varies greatly with location and altitude, according to ATom's deputy project scientist Michael Prather, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Irvine. Those methane variations are linked to pollution and also drive the creation and destruction of a second greenhouse gas scientists worry about—ozone. \"Methane is involved with ozone production in the lower atmosphere,\" said Newman. \"We partition ozone into two parts. The ozone that's up in the stratosphere, we call \"good\" ozone because it screens ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer and other ill effects. Now down in the troposphere, ozone is a pollutant, it's \"bad\" ozone. It can oxidize your lungs when you breathe it in.\" In addition to trapping heat, lower atmospheric ozone is highly reactive with other gases. Understanding how ozone's chemical behavior is related to other gases is important in order to improve climate models that simulate conditions in today's atmosphere and how they predict what we may expect from the effects of pollution and climate change. NASA's DC-8 aircraft will be loaded with 20 scientific instruments to measure the atmosphere on its around-the-world journey. The plane, about the size of a medium-sized commercial airliner, will make a series of gentle descents and ascents in order to capture the relatively warm humid air 500 feet (152 meters) above the ocean surface as well as the colder, dry air at its peak altitude of 35,000 feet (10,670 meters), and everything in between. After an initial flight from NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, to the equator and back, it will make nine stops over the course of 26 days, departing from California for the North Pole, then on to the tropics, the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, and across to the southern tip of South America before flying north toward Greenland. The final leg will cross North America back to California. \"ATom is basically slicing through the atmosphere with the aircraft, sampling enough so you find out what it looks like in all its variability,\" said Prather. Research flights to study the atmosphere in the past have mostly been limited to specific parts of the atmospheric that focused on targeted locations of pollution or atmospheric processes. These have allowed scientists to understand a great deal of detail for a relatively small part of the globe, Prather said. From these flights, the science community has learned that the \"atmosphere is basically a crazy quilt, and most studies focus on one type of patch,\" he said. \"ATom is the first airborne mission to try and put all the patches together and actually see what the whole quilt looks like. We need to find out how frequently different patches occur, and how they are connected.\" ATom's summer mission will be the first of four world-tour deployments over the next three years, one to take place in each season. It is funded by NASA's Earth Venture program and managed by the Earth Science Project Office at Ames. A team of over 100 people—scientists, engineers, flight crew and staff—across government agencies and universities will be supporting the mission both in the air and from the ground.

Credit: Science Directorate, NASA Langley Research Center. Most scientific observations are made by the most sophisticated of instruments. We build miles-long particle accelerators to see the smallest bits of atoms. We send bus-sized satellites all the way out to space to observe the science happening in our planet’s atmosphere. Sometimes, though, a machine just won’t do. Sometimes a school kid looking up at the sky does the job quite well. That is the premise of NASA’s S’COOL (Students’ Cloud Observations On-Line) project. While a satellite passes overhead observing the radiation given off by Earth, S’COOL participants look upwards and take careful notes on the type and multitude of clouds in the sky. This is not just for fun, and it's not just to get children and teens interested in the basics of atmospheric science. These observations are put to use by NASA scientists to verify that a satellite instrument overhead — the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) sensor — is accurately observing clouds from above. In some cases, CERES’ radiometers (energy-measuring devices) may interpret a glare or a land feature as a cloud. Student observations act as what’s known as a “ground truth” method to make sure the satellite is accurate. The more observations, the better. In this regard, the gold star goes to the students at Chartiers-Houston Jr./Sr. High School in Houston, Pa. These students have made more than 5,000 observations for the S’COOL folks at NASA’s Langley Research Center. (5,276 observations as of 10 January, to be exact.) The number is a record and nearly the doubles the total reported by any other school. The S’COOL program is beginning its 14th year and has inspired school children in more than 75 countries to take their cloud charts outside. Chartiers-Houston has long been among the most active in the program. Students can make observations anytime, but ideally they walk outside at the precise time that the satellite is passing over their town. They must know the types of clouds and know the recording methods to make useful observations. This requires, in other words, dedication.

    "content": "From Dr. Josh Willis, NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory oceanographer This famous climate scientist I know used to always begin his talks on sea level rise by showing a cartoon of a bathtub. A faucet would fill up the bathtub, representing water coming from melting glaciers and ice sheets, and then a small campfire would add heat, causing the water to expand. It was a nice way of getting people to think about the causes of sea level rise. But you might guess that the real ocean is a bit more complicated than the cartoon lets on. And you’d be right. Even though it’s sometimes convenient to think of the ocean as a great big bathtub, where turning on the tap at one end raises the water level in the whole tub, real sea level rise doesn’t quite happen that way. To understand why, you first have to realize that ‘sea level’ isn’t really level at all. There are lots of reasons why the oceans are not level. For example, vast ocean currents like the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio in the Pacific actually reshape the ocean surface, causing it to tilt. As the planet heats up, changes in the prevailing winds (which drive most of these ocean currents) cause changes in the currents, reshaping our ocean and changing local sea level as a result. Just as global warming does not raise land temperatures evenly, global ocean warming is not the same everywhere around the globe. Some regions of the oceans are heating up faster than others, and because warm water takes up more space than cold water, those regions experience faster sea level rise. Finally, the water locked away in the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica also shapes the ocean surface. As the ice sheets melt and lose water to the oceans, our entire planet feels the effects. The movement of mass from the ice sheets to the oceans very slightly shifts the direction of Earth’s rotation. This, along with changes in the gravitational pull of the ice sheets on the oceans, will reshape sea levels further still. So sea level rise is complicated, and the bathtub analogy just doesn’t cut it. Given all that, the image below is not that surprising. It shows how sea levels changed between",

Credit: NASA/GSFC/METI/Japan Space Systems, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team. NASA has selected a first-of-its-kind Earth science mission that will extend our nation’s lead in measuring key greenhouse gases and vegetation health from space to advance our understanding of Earth’s natural exchanges of carbon between the land, atmosphere and ocean. The primary goals of the Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory (GeoCARB), led by Berrien Moore of the University of Oklahoma in Norman, are to monitor plant health and vegetation stress throughout the Americas, and to probe, in unprecedented detail, the natural sources, sinks and exchange processes that control carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane in the atmosphere. The investigator-led mission will launch on a commercial communications satellite to make observations over the Americas from an orbit of approximately 22,000 miles (35,400 kilometers) above the equator. The mission was competitively selected from 15 proposals submitted to the agency's second Earth Venture - Mission announcement of opportunity for small orbital investigations of the Earth system. \"The GeoCARB mission breaks new ground for NASA's Earth science and applications programs,\" said Michael Freilich, director of the Earth Science Division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"GeoCARB will provide important new measurements related to Earth’s global natural carbon cycle, and will allow monitoring of vegetation health throughout North, Central and South America.\" GeoCARB will measure daily the total concentration of carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere with a horizontal ground resolution of 3 to 6 miles (5 to 10 kilometers). GeoCARB also will measure solar-induced fluorescence, a signal related directly to changes in vegetation photosynthesis and plant stress. Total NASA funding for the mission over the next five years will be $166 million, which includes initial development, launch of the mission as a hosted payload on a commercial communications satellite, and data analysis. The University of Oklahoma-led GeoCARB team will build an advanced payload that will be launched on a commercial communications satellite, employing otherwise unused launch and spacecraft capacity to advance science and provide societal benefit. By demonstrating GeoCARB can be flown as a hosted payload on a commercial satellite, the mission will strengthen NASA’s partnerships with the commercial satellite industry and provide a model that can be adopted by NASA’s international partners to expand these observations to other parts of the world. Mission partners include the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California; SES Government Solutions Company in Reston, Virginia; the Colorado State University in Fort Collins; and NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

A new study of the first year of observational data from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is providing significant surprises that will help in modeling Earth’s climate, forecasting our weather and monitoring agricultural crop growth. The findings are presented in a paper published recently in the journal Nature Geosciences by scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge; and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. They used SMAP measurements to estimate soil moisture memory in the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of Earth’s topsoils. The estimates improve upon earlier ones that were predicted from models or based on sparse data from ground observation stations. Soil moisture memory, which refers to how long it takes for soil moisture from rainfall to dissipate, can influence our weather and climate.

This persistence is greatest in Earth’s driest regions. The top 2 inches of topsoil on Earth’s land masses contains an infinitesimal fraction of our planet’s water — less than one-thousandth of one percent. Yet because of its position at the interface between land and atmosphere, that tiny amount plays a crucial role in everything from agriculture, weather, climate and even the spread of disease. This thin layer is a key part of the global water cycle over the continents and is also a key factor in the global energy and carbon cycles. The behavior and dynamics of this moisture reservoir have been hard to quantify and analyze, however, because soil moisture measurements have been slow and laborious to make, or too sparse for researchers to make general conclusions.

    "content": "Credit: Anton Gvozdikov / Shutterstock.com. By Laurie J. Schmidt Without its atmosphere, Earth would be a chilly place. Sunlight would illuminate the planet each day, and then much of its energy would leak right back to space, leaving the planet with an average surface temperature of around 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius). Fortunately for us, Earth has what’s called a greenhouse atmosphere, with gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4) and others that trap heat that is radiated up from the surface. Much like a greenhouse collects light and turns it into heat so plants can thrive, Earth’s atmosphere acts as a blanket, holding in heat from the Sun so it doesn’t escape back into space. “The greenhouse effect makes our planet habitable,” says Graeme Stephens, director of the Center for Climate Sciences at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). “The climate is just right on Earth because of its atmosphere.” Part of what makes Earth “just right” is the interplay between temperature, water vapor and heat in the form of infrared radiation. When Earth’s surface gets hotter, more evaporation occurs, which releases water vapor into the atmosphere. “Water vapor is a greenhouse gas. When more of it is in the air, it traps even more heat and radiates it back down to the surface,” says Mark Richardson, a postdoctoral scholar at JPL. “That extra infrared heat evaporates more water vapor, which traps more heat, then, in turn, evaporates even more water vapor, and so on. It becomes a feedback loop.” In tropical ocean regions, this feedback loop is super-powered because large amounts of water vapor are pumped upwards by convective storms high in the atmosphere that, in turn, traps heat so effectively. This extra heat can’t escape directly upwards to space in the form of infrared radiation, so it’s used to further drive convective storms and heavy tropical rainfall, which are powerful enough to transport the extra heat outside of the tropics. Regions where this occurs experience a super greenhouse effect (SGE). “This is a part of the planet where the heat has to be pushed and dragged out of there through some other mechanism, not through radiation back into space,” Stephens said. SGE regions occur in equatorial ocean areas, such as the western Pacific Ocean near Indonesia. “You need a lot of warm ocean water for evaporation and you need the atmosphere to be hot, because hotter air can hold more vapor,” Richardson said. For each degree kelvin of temperature rise on Earth, specific humidity (the ratio of water vapor to total air content) typically increases by about seven percent. “But these regions in the tropics gain much more than seven percent per kelvin,” says Brian Kahn, a research scientist at NASA JPL. “It can be 20 or 30 percent locally, so these SGE regions occur because water vapor builds up in the upper troposphere.” Kahn goes on to say this does not necessarily mean the local temperature goes up by three to four kelvin. The extra heat is transported outside of the SGE regions by large-scale atmospheric circulations driven by tropical convection. Scientists believe a similar process may have played a key role in what happened to the planet Venus. A few billion years ago, high levels of carbon dioxide in the Venusian atmosphere may have trapped enough heat to trigger a global SGE that boiled away the oceans. This is known as a runaway greenhouse effect. Today, the surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead. Could continued warming on Earth cause the super greenhouse effect in these tropical regions to “run away” as it might have occurred on Venus? Runaway greenhouse scenarios on Earth are highly speculative, says Kahn. “We know that we’re not anywhere near that,” he said. “You basically need CO2 levels of a couple thousand parts per million, of which we recently passed 400 parts per million, or a massive release of methane, and there’s really no evidence for that at this time.” To characterize these SGE regions in terms of how they might change in a warming world, Kahn, Richardson and Stephens compared results from a suite of climate models. “Each model uses a slightly different approach, but they report that if we add more CO2 to the air, Earth will get hotter and these SGE regions will expand in area,” Richardson said. “And as they expand, they’re going to trap more heat, and that heat has to go somewhere.” Scientists are interested in understanding how the extra heat trapped within the SGE regions would be transported away from these regions in a warming world. As part of the study, the team used data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite to look at the effect of temperature on water vapor. “AIRS gives us the temperature and water vapor profiles that show us how much warming and moistening we get as surface temperature goes up,” Kahn said. “The AIRS data very clearly show a lot of moistening as the temperature of the ocean increases. It’s so dramatic that we can actually see less infrared radiation going into space in the AIRS data.” Based on the team’s findings, as CO2 levels continue to increase in the coming decades, the SGE regions will intensify and expand in areal coverage. “We know that the CO2 increase is coming from fossil fuel burning—it’s unambiguous,” Kahn said. “And basic physics tells us that if you increase the amount of these greenhouse gases, you’ll get a warming influence.” “SGE regions are an interesting issue that we hadn’t really thought about,” Stephens said. “But we now understand why they occur and how they might change in a warming world.” This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "5 min read Even if there comes a day when the world completely stops emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, coastal regions and island nations will continue to experience rising sea levels for centuries afterward, according to a new study by researchers at MIT and Simon Fraser University. In a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers report that warming from short-lived compounds — greenhouse gases such as methane, chlorofluorocarbons, or hydrofluorocarbons, that linger in the atmosphere for just a year to a few decades — can cause sea levels to rise for hundreds of years after the pollutants have been cleared from the atmosphere. “If you think of countries like Tuvalu, which are barely above sea level, the question that is looming is how much we can emit before they are doomed. Are they already slated to go under, even if we stopped emitting everything tomorrow?” says co-author Susan Solomon, the Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Science at MIT. “It’s all the more reason why it’s important to understand how long climate changes will last, and how much more sea-level rise is already locked in.” Solomon’s co-authors are lead author Kirsten Zickfeld of Simon Fraser University and Daniel Gilford, a graduate student in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Recent studies by many groups, including Solomon’s own, have shown that even if human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide were to stop entirely, their associated atmospheric warming and sea-level rise would continue for more than 1,000 years. These effects — essentially irreversible on human timescales — are due in part to carbon dioxide’s residence time: The greenhouse gas can stay in the atmosphere for centuries after it’s been emitted from smokestacks and tailpipes. In contrast to carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons have much shorter lifetimes. However, previous studies have not specified what their long-term effects may be on sea-level rise. To answer this question, Solomon and her colleagues explored a number of climate scenarios using an Earth Systems Model of Intermediate Complexity, or EMIC, a computationally efficient climate model that simulates ocean and atmospheric circulation to project climate changes over decades, centuries and millenia. With the model, the team calculated both the average global temperature and sea-level rise, in response to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons. The researchers’ estimates for carbon dioxide agreed with others’ predictions and showed that, even if the world were to stop emitting carbon dioxide starting in",

Meltwater from this snow will eventually flow into the Colorado River, delivering much needed water to seven Western states and 33 million people. Accurately predicting water from snowmelt is critical to the region, and Earth-observing satellites can help. Credit: iStock. When Michelle Stokes and Stacie Bender look out across the snow-capped mountains of Utah and Colorado, they see more than just a majestic landscape. They see millions of gallons of water that will eventually flow into the Colorado River. The water stored as snowpack there will make its way to some 33 million people across seven western states, irrigating acres of lettuce, fruits and nuts in California, generating enormous amounts of electricity and ultimately flowing from taps in seven states. For a few of these sun-drenched states, snowfall (and its subsequent melt) provides up to 80 percent of the annual precipitation, which is ultimately used for drinking, farming, recreation and power generation. While it’s important for water managers in these states to know the amount of water they can expect from snowmelt, it’s every bit as important for them to know when to expect it. As hydrologists at the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, Stokes and Bender do just that, by providing stream flow forecasts for watersheds within the Colorado River Basin and the region. This basin includes some of the most parched land in the United States. As a result, so much water is taken out for human uses and so little put back in that the river routinely runs dry before it ever reaches its mouth at the Gulf of California in Mexico. With such a scarce resource, every drop counts. “The forecasts we get from the center provide crucial information for managing our water resources and reservoir facilities,” said Dave Kanzer, a deputy chief engineer for Colorado River District in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. “The water supply forecasts are critical. If we receive less water than the forecasts predict, we won’t have enough saved in the reservoirs to keep the river flowing throughout the irrigation demand season. Conversely, if we receive more than forecasted, we could have to release extra water, without causing damaging floods.” Aware of the importance of accuracy, the center inputs numerous readings into a complex computer program that uses that information to generate its forecasts.

If you look out the window, you can tell if it’s rainy or sunny right now, but that doesn’t say very much about your region’s climate—the area’s average weather conditions over a long period of time (30 years or more). However, that big tree in your backyard has been keeping a detailed climate record for decades. Trees can live for hundreds—and sometimes even thousands—of years. Over this long lifetime, a tree can experience a variety of environmental conditions: wet years, dry years, cold years, hot years, early frosts, forest fires and more. But how do trees keep track of this information? If you’ve ever seen a tree stump, you’ve probably noticed that the top of a stump has a series of concentric rings. These rings can tell us how old the tree is, and what the weather was like during each year of the tree’s life. The light-colored rings represent wood that grew in the spring and early summer, while the dark rings represent wood that grew in the late summer and fall. One light ring plus one dark ring equals one year of the tree’s life. Because trees are sensitive to local climate conditions, such as rain and temperature, they give scientists some information about that area’s local climate in the past. For example, tree rings usually grow wider in warm, wet years and they are thinner in years when it is cold and dry. If the tree has experienced stressful conditions, such as a drought, the tree might hardly grow at all in those years. Scientists can compare modern trees with local measurements of temperature and precipitation from the nearest weather station.

    "content": "3 min read By Carol Rasmussen,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory A new study suggests that most global climate models may underestimate the amount of rain that will fall in Earth's tropical regions as our planet continues to warm. That's because these models underestimate decreases in high clouds over the tropics seen in recent NASA observations, according to research led by scientist Hui Su of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Wait a minute: how can fewer clouds lead to more rainfall? Globally, rainfall isn't related just to the clouds that are available to make rain but also to Earth's \"energy budget\" — incoming energy from the sun compared to outgoing heat energy. High-altitude tropical clouds trap heat in the atmosphere. If there are fewer of these clouds in the future, the tropical atmosphere will cool. Judging from observed changes in clouds over recent decades, it appears that the atmosphere would create fewer high clouds in response to surface warming. It would also increase tropical rainfall, which would warm the air to balance the cooling from the high cloud shrinkage. Rainfall warming the air also sounds counterintuitive — people are used to rain cooling the air around them, not warming it. Several miles up in the atmosphere, however, a different process prevails. When water evaporates into water vapor here on Earth's surface and rises into the atmosphere, it carries with it the heat energy that made it evaporate. In the cold upper atmosphere, when the water vapor condenses into liquid droplets or ice particles, it releases its heat and warms the atmosphere. The new study is published in the journal Nature Communications. It puts the decrease in high tropical cloud cover in context as one result of a planet-wide shift in large-scale air flows that is occurring as Earth's surface temperature warms. These large-scale flows are called the atmospheric general circulation, and they include a wide zone of rising air centered on the equator. Observations over the last 30 to 40 years have shown that this zone is narrowing as the climate warms, causing the decrease in high clouds. Su and colleagues at JPL and four universities compared climate data from the past few decades with 23 climate model simulations of the same period. Climate modelers use retrospective simulations like these to check how well their numerical models are able to reproduce observations. For data, the team used observations of outgoing thermal radiation from NASA's spaceborne Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and other satellite instruments, as well as ground-level observations. Su's team found that most of the climate models underestimated the rate of increase in precipitation for each degree of surface warming that has occurred in recent decades. The models that came closest to matching observations of clouds in the present-day climate showed a greater precipitation increase for the future than the other models. Su said that by tracing the underestimation problem back to the models' deficiencies in representing tropical high clouds and the atmospheric general circulation, \"This study provides a pathway for improving predictions of future precipitation change.\" The study is titled \"Tightening of Tropical Ascent and High Clouds Key to Precipitation Change in a Warmer Climate.\" NASA uses satellite lidar technology to study Earth’s forests, key carbon sinks.

    "date": null,
    "content": "4 min read The Louisiana coastline is sinking under the Gulf of Mexico at the rate of about one football field of land every hour (about 18 square miles of land lost in a year). But within this sinking region, two river deltas are growing. The Atchafalaya River and its diversion channel, Wax Lake Outlet, are gaining about one football field of new land every 11 and 8 hours, respectively (1.5 and 2 square miles per year). Last fall, a team from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, showed that radar, lidar and spectral instruments mounted on aircraft can be used to study the growing deltas, collecting data that can help scientists better understand how coastal wetlands will respond to global sea level rise. The basics of delta building are understood, but many questions remain about how specific characteristics, such as vegetation types, tides, currents and the shape of the riverbed, affect a delta’s growth or demise. That's partly because it's hard to do research in a swamp. \"These factors are usually studied using boats and instruments that have to be transported through marshy and difficult terrain,\" said Christine Rains of JPL, an assistant flight coordinator for the program. \"This campaign was designed to show that wetlands can also be measured with airborne remote sensing over a large area.\" JPL researchers fly over the Louisiana coastline at least once a year to keep track of subsidence (sinking) and changes in levees. The most recent airborne flights, however, focused on the growing deltas — specifically, flowing water and vegetation. JPL's Marc Simard, principal investigator for the campaign, explained that on a delta, water flows in every direction, including uphill. \"Water flows not only through the main channels of the rivers but also through the marshes,\" he explained. \"There is also the incoming tide, which pushes water back uphill. The tide enhances the flow of water out of the main channels into the marshes.\" When the tide goes out, water drains from the marshes, carrying sediment and carbon. The JPL instruments took measurements during both rising and falling tides to capture these flows. They also made the first complete measurement of the slope of the water surface and topography of the river bottom for both rivers from their origin at the Mississippi River to the ocean — necessary information for understanding the rivers' flow speeds. Some types of marsh vegetation resist flowing water better than others, as the new measurements have documented. Simard said, \"We were really surprised and impressed by how the water level changes within the marshes. In some places, the water changes by 10 centimeters [four inches] in an hour or two. In others, it's only three or four centimeters [an inch or inch-and-a-half]. You can see amazing patterns in the remote sensing measurements.\" Three JPL airborne instruments, flying on three planes, were needed to observe the flows and the movement of carbon with the water. The team measured rising and falling water in vegetated areas using the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) instrument. They measured the same changes in open water with the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) lidar. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) was used to estimate the sediment, carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the water. Now that the team has demonstrated that these airborne instruments can make precise and detailed measurements in this difficult environment, the researchers plan to use the new data to improve models of how water flows through marshes. Scientists use these models to study how coastal marshes will cope with rising sea levels. With so many measurements available as a reality check, Simard said, \"Our models will have to catch up with the observations now.\" View a slideshow of the growth of the two deltas over the last 30 years: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/wax_lake.php Media contact Alan BuisJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California818-354-",

Then in fall and winter, when trees lose their leaves and foliage declines, CO2 levels begin to rise again.

In an email sent to SAGE III team members early Friday afternoon, acting SAGE III Project Manager Joe Gasbarre said, “After the mission operations and science teams had a chance early this morning to review the data received overnight, it was clear several successful solar occultations occurred, thus proving First Light had been achieved on the instrument.” Solar occultation is a type of measurement that involves looking at the light from the sun as it passes through Earth’s atmosphere at the edge, or limb, of the planet. SAGE III uses both solar and lunar occultation to measure ozone and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere. Autonomous operations of the instrument will continue over the weekend. Next week, the mission operations team will settle into what Gasbarre referred to as a “cadence of adjustments and data analysis” as instrument commissioning moves into full swing. Complete commissioning and calibration of SAGE III will take approximately 90 days. The SAGE III mission operations team is based at the Flight Mission Support Center at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. “I cannot say enough about the efforts of this entire team stretching back many years,” said Gasbarre in his email. “This success is only possible due to the hard work, sacrifice and support of the entire team as well as our stakeholders.” Once fully commissioned, SAGE III will take occultation measurements about 15 or 16 times a day. The space station’s unique orbital path will allow SAGE III to make observations during all seasons and over a large portion of the globe.

The aquifers, discovered only recently, are unusual in that they trap large amounts of liquid water within the ice sheet. Until now, scientists did not know what happened to the water stored away in this reservoir — the discovery will help fine tune computer models of Greenland’s contribution to sea level rise. “This paper illuminates the fate of the aquifer’s water,” said Kristin Poinar, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Before, we didn’t know if the water froze inside the ice sheet or reemerged onto the ice surface. In either of those scenarios, the meltwater would not contribute to sea level rise.” Now, using a new computer model that tests whether certain meltwater-filled cracks can fracture to the base of the ice sheet, Poinar and her colleagues have shown that the meltwater does reach the ocean. Greenland contributes water to the sea mainly through surface melt and ice flow. Studies have shown that surface melt has increased in recent decades. In western Greenland, so much surface melts forms that it creates a network of rivers and lakes, which drain through the ice to the underlying bedrock, from where water flows to the ocean. But southeast Greenland is very different – lakes and rivers do not form, although the ice does melt. Instead, vast reservoirs of water become trapped within the firn layer (a band of compacted snow). In",

Credit: NASA. Less is more, and that's not just a buzz phrase. Good things are coming in smaller packages (again, not just another buzz phrase). Here's one that's 'on the rocks' coming soon to a launch near you; NASA has an IceCube that will be out of this world. IceCube, which will measure cloud ice levels using a radiometer, is the first small satellite project managed by Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility. After two years in the making, the 10-pound, breadloaf-sized satellite is poised to take flight on Orbital ATK's seventh contracted commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. IceCube, the first small satellite project managed by Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility, is a 3U cubesat weighing 10 pounds and about the size of a breadloaf, complete with three-axis attitude control, deployable solar areas and a deployable UHF communications antenna. Credit: NASA. \"Bringing IceCube from concept to operational satellite ready for launch is a remarkable achievement by an incredibly talented, diverse science and engineering team,\" said Bill Wrobel, Wallops Flight Facility director. \"Goddard Space Flight Center's expertise in engineering and project management at its Wallops campus coupled with the scientific muscle at Goddard's Greenbelt campus makes us a natural fit for small satellite work.\" IceCube is a type of smallsat known as a cubesat, and more specifically, it's a 3U cubesat. Each \"U\" is a cubic of 10 centimeters in size; as a 3U cubesat, IceCube measures 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters. Despite its relatively small size, IceCube is a bonafide spacecraft complete with three-axis attitude control, deployable solar arrays and a deployable UHF communications antenna. \"The technologies to make these small satellites is constantly evolving, getting increasingly smaller and lighter without sacrificing capability,\" said Tom Johnson, Goddard Space Flight Center's Small Satellite manager. Johnson, who's stationed at Wallops, led mission management activities for the project. Once launched and deployed from the ISS, the IceCube team will spend about two weeks conducting various check-outs on the satellite before starting the spacecraft's operational mission, which is to perform cloud ice measurements using an 883-Gigahertz radiometer. Cloud ice properties are key variables used in weather and climate models. Currently, there's a large uncertainty in measuring cloud ice in the atmosphere at altitudes between 5 to 15 kilometers. IceCube will collect the first global map of cloud-induced radiances at 883-Gigahertz. The overall objective of IceCube is to raise the technology readiness level (TRL) of the radiometer to measure cloud ice levels. NASA uses nine TRLs to assess the maturity level of a particular technology ranging from TRL 1, meaning basic principles have been observed, expanding up to TRL 9, which means a particular technology or system is flight-proven and successful. The radiometer capability for intermediate altitude cloud ice measurements is currently at TRL 6; the goal is to get to TRL 9 with IceCube, said Johnson. The Goddard team faced a number of challenges during the design, integration and testing of the spacecraft. Notably, to keep costs down for the project, the team used commercial off-the-shelf components to build the spacecraft. The components, coming from multiple commercial providers, didn't always \"plug and play\" together, said Johnson, creating significant engineering challenges. The team persevered, integrating the radiometer to the spacecraft, building the spacecraft support systems, and conducting thermal-vacuum, vibration, and antenna testing all at Goddard and Wallops facilities. \"The team had to overcome so many challenges and they worked hard to meet the delivery date prior to the holidays,\" said Johnson. \"I am very proud of the engineering team that worked so hard to achieve this milestone.\" In addition to IceCube, Goddard's small satellite office at Wallops is providing mission management for a number of other missions, such as HaloSat and the Time-Resolved Obeservations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS).

    "content": "5 min read By Joe Atkinson,NASA's Langley Research Center NASA scientists are once again on the hunt for greenhouse gases in the sky. Researchers for the Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America, or ACT-America, study returned to the field last week to measure how weather systems transport carbon dioxide and methane through the atmosphere over the eastern part of the United States. By measuring those greenhouse gases, they hope to improve our understanding of where they originate. And in the case of carbon dioxide, they hope to learn more about where it’s being absorbed. Ultimately, by giving scientists a clearer understanding of what the sources and sinks are, the study could help refine climate models, which could in turn inform future policy decisions around the production of greenhouse gases. Previous ACT-America flight campaigns took place in summer and winter. The focus this time is fall. “We want to know the net balance of greenhouse gas sources and sinks over an annual cycle,” said ACT-America Principal Investigator Ken Davis of Pennsylvania State University, University Park. “And so this will be the fall installment of putting that four-season story together.” Flights are currently based out of coastal Virginia using two Virginia-based NASA aircraft outfitted with greenhouse-gas-detecting instruments — a C-130 from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and a B-200 from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton. Oct. 16, flights will transition to Lincoln, Nebraska. For the final two weeks of the current campaign, flights will leave from Shreveport, Louisiana. Because it’s fall, researchers will see little photosynthesis, which would be a net sink for carbon dioxide. Instead, decaying biomass will be releasing carbon dioxide — think decomposing fallen leaves in the east, detritus from harvested crops in the Midwest. The decomposition taking place in the fall ecosystems will probably yield the strongest net sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere the study finds at any time of year, giving the campaign a good chance to see firsthand the intensity of these well-known processes. The flights, of course, don’t extend over the entire season — only about a six-week period. But the comparison of aircraft data and numerical models allows scientists to extend their understanding across space and time. For example, the flight data will provide useful comparisons to current ecosystem carbon models. “We should be able to say, Hey, for these weeks, are the ecosystem models in these places doing the right thing or not?” said Davis. “We should be able to prune down toward the more realistic ecosystem carbon models.” Joining the current flights are researchers with the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. They’re operating an instrument on the C-130 that measures both methane and ethane. Methane can come from natural sources such as wetlands, but human activities produce much of the methane found in the atmosphere. Fossil fuel burning, landfills and livestock farming are all significant sources. Combined with an instrument on the B200 operated by the University of Colorado, the project now has ethane sensors on both aircraft. In a mutually beneficial partnership, the fall flights are giving the DLR a chance to see how their instrument operates in the field while also allowing the ACT-America scientists to better zero in on methane sources. “Microbes, when they’re decomposing things, burp out methane. They don’t occasionally accidentally burp out an ethane molecule. Their metabolism doesn’t do that. They make methane,” said Davis. “If your methane comes with ethane, it came from a fossil-fuel source, not from biology. So it’s a very useful tracer.” Though the ACT-America team has a good general idea of what to expect from the fall flights, they’re always open to surprises. Last year’s summer flights across frontal boundaries revealed a fascinating phenomenon: Every single time the aircraft crossed from a warm air mass into cold air, carbon dioxide concentrations dropped. The opposite seemed to be true for methane — concentrations were lower in warm air, higher in cold. The consistency of that sharp gradient wasn’t something anyone anticipated. “We really didn’t know what we’re going to find in that respect,” said Davis. “And to find it to be so repeatable and so oriented with these frontal structures — darn, we think we really are measuring the right thing here in terms of how weather systems redistribute these gases and that they are an important source of redistribution of the gases north and south, and up and down.” Flights for the fall campaign will wrap up in early November.

    "content": "Interview by Patrick Lynch, NASA Langley Research Center Dave Young is the Project Scientist for NASA’s CLimate Absolute Radiance and REfractivity Observatory (CLARREO). CLARREO is a climate-focused mission set to launch in the latter part of this decade. The goal of the mission is to measure tiny, incremental changes in the amount of energy entering and leaving Earth’s atmosphere — with such accuracy that even minor global warming trends over the course of a decade will be detected with confidence. These climate change measurements will carry the “fingerprints” of what caused them, including those caused by human activity. 1. You're project scientist for NASA's CLARREO mission. Tell us about the project. One of the things that prevents us from making definitive statements about climate change is the accuracy of the current observing system we have. A major goal of the CLARREO mission is to provide extremely accurate climate measurements — at the accuracy level of tenths of a percent per decade. By knowing these trends very precisely, we can improve the accuracy of climate change forecasts, which will help society make the tough decisions we're facing. 2. So what sort of data will it collect, and how? CLARREO won't measure individual aspects of our climate, such as changes in carbon dioxide levels or ice sheet changes. Instead, it will look at the climate system as a whole, by tracking the amount of energy entering and leaving the Earth's atmosphere. We'll do this by making measurements of the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere, including infrared waves (heat) and reflected sunlight. These are the two components of what we call the Earth's \"energy budget,\" which can tell us over time whether or not the planet is getting warmer or cooler. We know the things that can cause our climate to change. They include changes in the intensity of the sun, and increases in heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. What we want to learn is how the Earth responds to these driving forces, and any other secondary feedback effects that might occur. For example, say the Earth responds to increases in carbon dioxide levels by warming up; a warmer planet causes more water to evaporate and increases the amount of certain types of clouds. Clouds could either accelerate or slow down subsequent global warming. By taking very accurate energy measurements from space over a long period of time, we'll be able to measure these responses and feedbacks on decade-long timescales. 3. CLARREO claims it will produce an \"irrefutable climate record.\" Does that mean it will put an end to climate change controversy? Producing a trusted and tested climate record is one of our goals. First, we will strive for 100 percent transparency. Part of this [recent] email scandal is that people think data and results have been hidden. Second, we will characterize our instruments as thoroughly as anybody has ever done. On board the spacecraft there will be a verification system that's constantly monitoring not only the measurements we make, but also how accurately we're making those measurements. Then I think you'll have as close to an irrefutable measurement as possible. People want to talk in certainty. They want to say climate change is a certainty. Or, climate change is nonsense. That doesn't work. Predicting future climate change is about offering a range of potential scenarios based on a range of present-day factors, and then determining the most likely scenario. We're designing the mission such that if people want to delve into it and question our results, the answers will be there for all to see. 4. What will we learn about our influence on the Earth's climate that we didn't know before? That's one of the things we're trying to answer specifically by working with the climate modelers. The goal is to have a set of highly accurate measurements that can be used to track today's global warming trends and to improve climate models' predictions for the future. We've pretty much shown that you can separate man-made climate change from natural climate variations using the data we expect to collect. You'll see the impact of changes in carbon dioxide, methane and other gases reflected in the changes in the temperatures we measure. By comparing these numbers to the climate models, we'll really understand how that climate change developed. 5. One of the most important climate summits in history happened just a few months ago in Copenhagen. How would CLARREO's data help world leaders make better policy decisions? If CLARREO were in orbit now, I think we'd have a much better assessment of climate change, particularly during the satellite era, and a more precise knowledge of climate trends over the last several decades. That would help the debate. Would it have made Copenhagen a joyous celebration of unanimity among the nations? No, because there are other things — political and economic — that are contributing factors to the debate. Basically, what CLARREO will do is provide more confidence in the scientific information we have, from the CLARREO record itself and also from comparisons with other measurements.

    "content": "From NASA NASA coral reef studies in Hawaii this winter will help scientists understand this unique environment. Credit: NOAA. NASA pulled off a scientific double play in Hawaii this winter, using the same instruments and aircraft to study both volcanoes and coral reefs. Besides helping scientists understand these two unique environments better, the data will be used to evaluate the possibility of preparing a potential future NASA satellite that would monitor ecosystem changes and natural hazards. The advantages of studying active volcanoes from the air rather than the ground are obvious. Coral reefs may not offer the same risks in a close encounter that volcanoes do, but there's another good reason to study them by remote sensing: they're dotted across thousands of square miles of the globe. It's simply not feasible to survey such a large area from a boat. So NASA has been monitoring coral reefs by satellite and aircraft for several decades. Recent airborne efforts have used sensors that provide better spatial and spectral resolution than currently available from NASA satellite systems. \"Reefs are threatened by bleaching due to rising sea surface temperatures as well as, to some degree, by increasing acidification of ocean waters,” said Woody Turner of NASA Headquarters in Washington, the program scientist for the recent Hawaii study. “On top of that, since they're coastal ecosystems, they are also subject to sediment and other effluents running offshore. We have an urgent need to get a handle now on how reefs are changing.\" Over the past four years, NASA has flown a series of research flights over California, carrying airborne prototypes of instruments in preparation for a possible future satellite mission called the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), now in the conceptual design phase. The Golden State has many diverse landscapes to test the instruments' observational capabilities, but not coral reefs or erupting volcanoes. This winter's HyspIRI Hawaii field campaign filled that gap. To get the next best thing to a satellite's point of view, HyspIRI Hawaii used a high-altitude ER-2 aircraft from NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, Palmdale, California. During the study, the aircraft was based at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. Flying at approximately 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) and thus above most of Earth's atmosphere, the ER-2 carried the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and the MODIS-ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), developed by NASA’s Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. AVIRIS is an imaging spectrometer that observes the complete reflected spectrum of light in the visible and shortwave infrared wavelengths. MASTER has multiple observational channels in the thermal infrared wavelengths. Together AVIRIS and MASTER provide the same combination of spectral bands planned for the future HyspIRI mission — and powerful data for current coral reef research. Six coral reef-related projects with diverse objectives are using imagery that AVIRIS and MASTER collected around the Hawaiian archipelago in January through early March. • Under principal investigator Steven Ackleson (U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington), a team investigated how coral reefs and water quality vary, in both space and time, over the huge distance encompassed by the Hawaiian Islands and the 1,200-mile-long (2,000-kilometer-long) Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument north of the main islands.

In a highly choreographed sequence of events, the station’s robotic Canadarm2 removed the instrument payload and its Nadir Viewing Platform (NVP) from the Dragon trunk and installed them on the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier platform. The entire sequence took about four days. The NVP allows SAGE III to face nadir, or down, toward Earth. Final installation of the instrument payload, which includes SAGE III and its hexapod pointing system, took place March 7. “With a flawless launch and the on-orbit assembly sequence behind us, the SAGE III and the space station teams have completed a major milestone,” said SAGE III Project Manager Mike Cisewski. “Our team is ready to proceed with payload commissioning and our long-term work of extending the SAGE data record from the station.” Activation and calibration of SAGE III will take approximately 90 days. Brooke Thornton, SAGE III mission operations manager, and the mission operations team will closely monitor those activities from the Flight Mission Support Center at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. It’s an exhilarating time for the mission operations team. Thornton admits to feeling both excitement and nervousness, but also a strong sense that she and her team are ready to do their jobs. “The operations team has been working so hard to get fully prepared for this and now that it is here it’s almost a relief,” said Thornton. “This team has operated and tested this payload for nearly five years now, so I know we have the best team to get us through activation and all the extensive calibration activities. We’re ready to get into routine operations.” SAGE III is a key part of NASA’s mission to provide crucial, long-term measurements that will help humans understand and care for Earth’s atmosphere.

    "date": null,
    "content": "5 min read Projected increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves in the desert of the southwestern United States are putting songbirds at greater risk for death by dehydration and mass die-offs, according to a new study. Researchers used hourly temperature maps and other data produced by the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)—a land-surface modeling effort maintained by NASA and other organizations—along with physiological data to investigate how rates of evaporative water loss in response to high temperatures varied among five bird species with differing body masses. Using this data, they were able to map the potential effects of current and future heat waves on lethal dehydration risk for songbirds in the Southwest and how rapidly dehydration can occur in each species. Researchers homed in on five songbird species commonly found in the desert southwest: lesser goldfinch, house finch, cactus wren, Abert's towhee and the curve-billed thrasher. Under projected conditions where temperatures increase by 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with some scenarios for summer warming by the end of the century, heatwaves will occur more often, become hotter, and expand in geographic range to the point where all five species will be at greater risk for lethal dehydration. Birds are susceptible to heat stress in two ways, said co-author Blair Wolf, a professor of biology at the University of New Mexico. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Wolf investigated heat tolerance for each of the five species in the study as well as for other bird species in Australia and South Africa. “When it’s really hot, they simply can’t evaporate enough water to stay cool, so they overheat and die of heat stroke,” he said. “In other cases, the high rates of evaporative water loss needed to stay cool deplete their body water pools to lethal levels and birds die of dehydration. This is the stressor we focused on in this study.” What happens is at about 40 degrees Celsius [104 degrees Fahrenheit], these songbirds start panting, which increases the rate of water loss very rapidly, explained co-author Alexander Gerson, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. At the time of the study, he worked with Wolf as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New Mexico. He added, “Most animals can only tolerate water losses that result in 15 or 20 percent loss of body mass before they die. So an animal experiencing peak temperatures during a hot summer day, with no access to water, isn’t going to make it more than a few hours.” As expected, they found that the small species are particularly susceptible to lethal dehydration because they lose water at a proportionately higher rate. For example, at 50 degrees Celsius [122 degrees Fahrenheit], the lesser goldfinch and the house finch lose 8 to 9 percent of their body mass to evaporative water loss per hour, whereas the larger Curve-billed thrasher only loses about 5 percent of its mass per hour. By the end of the century, the number of days in the southwest desert where lethal dehydration poses a high risk to the lesser goldfinch increases from 7 to 25 days per year. For larger species, those days will also increase, but will remain rare. Despite their physiological disadvantage, house finches and lesser goldfinches might actually fare comparatively better, the researchers noted, because they can survive in a number of ecosystems and they have a more expansive range. But desert specialists such as the curve-billed thrasher and Abert’s towhee have more specific habitat needs and so have a more limited range, restricted in the United States mostly to the hot deserts of the Southwest. That means that a greater proportion of their population is at risk for lethal dehydration when severe enough heatwaves occur. “When you get into a situation where the majority of the range is affected, that’s where we start to become more alarmed at what we are seeing,” said lead author Tom Albright from the University of Nevada, Reno, noting that this increases the risk of lethal dehydration affecting a large proportion of the population. According to the researchers, given this warming scenario, climate refugia—microclimates such as mountaintops, trees and washes with shade that allow songbird body temperatures to cool to safe levels—might prove very important in management plans for certain vulnerable species. “Using this type of data, managers identifying the best refugia can have a better idea of the temperature profile that will be suitable for these birds,” Gerson said. This research is part of a global effort among researchers from the US, South Africa and Australia to more thoroughly understand the physiological responses of birds to increasing temperatures, with the goal of broadening our understanding of how rising temperatures will affect individuals, populations, and community structure. A three-year, $350,000 NASA New Investigator award also funded University of Nevada, Reno-based modeling aspects of this research. To read the paper, visit: http://m.pnas.org/content/early/",

    "title": "Core questions: An introduction to ice cores",
    "date": null,
    "content": "6 min read By Jessica Stoller-Conrad,NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory When archaeologists want to learn about the history of an ancient civilization, they dig deeply into the soil, searching for tools and artifacts to complete the story. Scientists who study Earth’s past climates, called paleoclimatologists, take a similar approach. However, instead of digging into the soil, they look for clues about our planet’s climate history by studying coral reefs, digging into ocean and lake floor sediment and drilling deeply into glaciers and ice sheets. The samples they collect from the ice, called ice cores, hold a record of what our planet was like hundreds of thousands of years ago. But where do ice cores come from, and what do they tell us about climate change? Climate scientist Allegra LeGrande of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and physical scientist Kimberly Casey of the U.S. Geological Survey and Cryospheric Sciences Lab at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center helped answer these questions and more. Ice sheets and glaciers near Earth’s North and South Poles formed from years and years of accumulating snowfall. The weight of each year’s snowfall compresses down the previous layers of snow, and after many years, all of this pressure helps to form glacial ice. In some areas, these layers result in ice sheets that are several miles (several kilometers) thick. Researchers drill ice cores from deep (sometimes more than a mile, or more than 1.6 kilometers) inside the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as some high-latitude ice caps and mountain glaciers. They collect ice cores in many locations around Earth to study regional climate variability and compare and differentiate that variability from global climate signals. Each layer of ice tells a story about what Earth was like when that layer of snow fell. For example, LeGrande says, as snow deposits onto a growing glacier, the temperature of the air imprints onto the water molecules. The icy layers also hold particles—aerosols such as dust, ash, pollen, trace elements and sea salts—that were in the atmosphere at that time. These particles remain in the ice thousands of years later, providing physical evidence of past global events, such as major volcanic eruptions. Additionally, as the ice compacts over time, tiny bubbles of the atmosphere—including greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane—press inside the ice. These air pocket “fossils” provide samples of what the atmosphere was like when that layer of ice formed, LeGrande said. “Scientists can directly measure the amount of greenhouse gases that were in the atmosphere at that time by sampling these bubbles,” she added. Scientists also use ice core temperature data to validate climate models that predict Earth’s future climate. A climate model is like a laboratory inside a computer, LeGrande said. Scientists build all of the existing knowledge about how the atmosphere, ocean, land and ice work into this special laboratory. They also have to add in any variables that may alter the climate system at different points in time—such as Earth’s location in its orbit and how far it will be from the Sun. “Climate models are designed to reproduce the relatively stable climate that people have observed for the past 160 to 170 years,” LeGrande said. “It sounds like a long time, but this used to be possible—in the days of the Farmer’s Almanac—because Earth’s climate system was quite stable.” However, predicting the climate of the future is a bit more complicated these days, she said. “The climate of the next century will be well beyond the range of the climate that we have observed for the last 160 years,” LeGrande explained. To test the climate models under these very different environmental conditions, scientists test the models by simulating past climates. Ice core records are an essential part of creating and checking these simulations. The oldest ice cores, from East Antarctica, provide an 800,000-year-old record of Earth’s climate. How do we know they’re that old? Each season’s snowfall has slightly different properties than the last. These differences create annual layers in the ice that can be used to count the age of the ice, just like rings inside a tree. However, the more the ice compacts and the less that snow accumulates, the harder it is to see these annual layers. To analyze the age of the deepest layers, scientists use a variety of methods, including measurements of the chemical composition and electrical conductivity of the ice. Scientists also use computer modeling techniques that can help to understand the relationship between the depth of the core and the age of the ice. After drilling, measuring and logging an ice core, researchers store the cores in bags or netting in cylindrical tubes. Then they pack the tubes into cardboard boxes or protective waterproof hard cases and transport the cores by sled, plane, boat and truck to storage facilities. Once the ice cores reach storage facilities, scientists digitally record the ice cores’ characteristics—such as the presence of volcanic ash or the appearance of bubbles in the ice—in a controlled cold laboratory. The U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory, in Lakewood, Colorado, is the U.S. storage facility, which archives ice cores from all over the world. This storage facility also acts as a library: when scientists want to study a certain ice core from a particular region, they can apply to have a portion of the ice core sent to them for their studies. NASA satellites and airborne missions collect data about snow and ice properties, including the snow’s layering, or stratigraphy, and accumulation patterns. This knowledge of the stratigraphy and other properties can be an asset when analyzing the hundreds of thousands of years of snowfall recorded in ice cores. “In addition to satellite and airborne data collection and analysis, NASA scientists participate in field work to collect ice cores and other related data, such as ground penetrating radar,” Casey said. “A combination of the ice core data with radar and other observational data aids in our understanding of snow accumulation, ice flow and climate changes over time.” For the South Pole Ice Core project, in which scientists drilled a core from",

Patzert is one of thousands of southern Californian residents who have been affected by the wildfires that erupted in the Angeles National Forest two weeks ago. In an article in the Pasadena Star-News, Patzert argues that southern California was actually very lucky, as driving winds could have made the fire much, much worse. Here’s an excerpt: \"I'm stressed out and exhausted. My Sierra Madre neighborhood has been blanketed by ash and smoke. We've closed up everything and set the air conditioner at 80 degrees, but the smoke smells have seeped in and my sleep has been restless. My nerves and I'm sure many others, are on edge. But, driving into JPL one morning last week, I took a deep breath ... cough, cough ... and realized how much worse all this could have been. Yep, I might not be driving into JPL, if Santa Ana winds had propelled this mammoth fire out of the Angeles National Forest and into the crowded foothill neighborhoods.

    "content": "5 min read By Jessica Stoller-Conrad,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory When you sit down for breakfast, you’re probably not thinking about every step in the supply chain that ultimately allowed you to pour a bowl of cereal. However, for scientists and policymakers, understanding this complicated process is an important step toward ensuring food security in the United States and across the globe. NASA satellites are constantly keeping a close eye on our planet. And their observations are helping farmers, scientists and policymakers develop strategies to improve food production and availability. One major factor that influences food security is the availability of water. When an area has plenty of water, crops thrive and livestock have plenty of lush grass to graze on. However, even just a few dry months can have a dramatic impact on a region’s food production. Several NASA missions are closely monitoring the water on our planet. These satellites collect information about soil moisture, flooding and drought, groundwater and crop health. One mission, called SMAP—short for Soil Moisture Active Passive—plays a particularly important role in understanding the impact of droughts. From orbit, SMAP measures the amount of water in the top 2 inches (5 centimeters) of soil everywhere on Earth. This top layer of soil is where we grow the food we eat. SMAP is orbiting 426 miles (685 km) above, but it can see through layers of Earth’s atmosphere and vegetation and into the soil using microwaves. These observations are used to make global maps of soil moisture and improve our understanding of how water and carbon circulate on Earth. The soil moisture data from SMAP is also sent to a USDA tool called Crop Explorer, which can be used by farmers and those who work in foreign agricultural policy. The tool can be used to see how severe the drought is in a specific area. It can also provide a prediction about approximately how long a drought might last. If an area is in a severe drought that is expected to last for a while, information from the tool can help farmers decide if they’ll need to change their crops or their planting practices. In this way, the tool can possibly help farmers to produce more food with less water. Soil moisture data from SMAP can also be used by scientists to simulate future crop growth. These simulations could one day help farmers plan how they will harvest and manage specific crops. For many people around the world, the oceans are also a rich source of food—from fish and shellfish to seaweed and algae. However, Earth’s warming climate could mean drastic changes for these very sensitive ocean ecosystems. Several NASA missions are closely monitoring changes in the oceans—information that can also be used to help determine the health of ocean life. NASA satellites collect information about ocean temperature and color, ocean currents, winds and severe storms, and melting sea ice. These measurements can help scientists better understand how quickly the oceans are changing. The data can also help scientists estimate the health of the oceans and how well they are supporting sea life—as well as the amount of seafood produced by the ocean. For example, although the ocean may appear deep blue to the naked eye, there are regions of the ocean that are actually slightly green. The color comes from chlorophyll—a green pigment found in tiny marine organisms called phytoplankton. Chlorophyll helps the phytoplankton turn sunlight and carbon dioxide into food and oxygen. Instruments on board NASA’s Aqua and Suomi NPP satellites collect detailed information about the color of the ocean. Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center use this information to track the location of phytoplankton in the ocean, and to study how weather patterns, such as El Niño, can change where these phytoplankton live. While you’re unlikely to find phytoplankton on the menu at your local seafood restaurant, these tiny plants can have a big impact on the global fishing industry. Phytoplankton are an essential part of the ocean food web, and all of the fish that we do eat depend on phytoplankton to survive. In fact, the strong",

    "content": "3 min read In May, a team of Goddard scientists will begin measuring greenhouse gases over the Mid-Atlantic region — an area chosen in part because it encompasses a range of vegetation, climate and soil types that would influence the exchange of carbon dioxide and methane between the Earth and the atmosphere. The airborne campaign, called the Carbon Airborne Flux Experiment, or CARAFE, could help scientists better understand the exchange process, also known as flux, and improve computer models that predict Earth’s carbon sinks, natural or artificial areas that absorb carbon dioxide or methane. Scientists know how much carbon dioxide is produced annually through the burning of fossil fuels. They also know that about 44 percent of these emissions stay in the atmosphere and that the oceans and land sinks take up the rest. What they don’t know as well is what biological mechanisms currently control the uptake and storage in grasses, crops and trees. They also don’t know whether these sinks will continue, considering ever-increasing emissions and changing climate. Currently, most flux data are gathered at towers or inferred from atmospheric carbon measurements, including those from satellites. Unfortunately, towers typically measure only the conditions occurring within their general vicinities. CARAFE will help rectify that. The team will use CARAFE data to determine how well computer models represent regional flux variations and compare actual surface flux rates against those inferred from satellite data — both of which will help improve existing atmospheric and ecosystem computer modeling. These analyses can help improve representations of the land surface in both weather and climate models. “Hopefully we will be able to demonstrate the value of these measurements,” said CARAFE Principal Investigator Randy Kawa, an expert in carbon modeling. “We want to build a confident and consistent picture of both carbon-dioxide and methane fluxes and their dependence on underlying biological, geological, weather and chemical processes. This will allow decision makers to make better informed decisions about greenhouse gas policy and impacts.” During the month-long campaign, a NASA C-23 Sherpa aircraft from the Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern Shore will fly at various altitudes over the Pocomoke Forest area on the Eastern Shore of Maryland; agricultural areas and tidal marshlands from the Eastern Shore of Virginia to southern Delaware; the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean; southern Maryland; the New Jersey Pine Barrens in the southern portion of the state; and the Alligator River and the Great Dismal Swamp in eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. While flying “low and slow,” the campaign’s modified, commercial-off-the-shelf methane/carbon-dioxide analyzers, wind sensors, camera, and GPS will gather 10 carefully synchronized measurements per second. Specifically, the instruments will measure both greenhouse gas levels along tree lines and vertical wind speeds, which when combined reveal how fast these gases transfer to or from the atmosphere. “If the GPS data is off by even a half second, the flux measurements are off,” said CARAFE Co-Principal Investigator Paul Newman, adding that the team used Goddard Internal Research and Development program funding to modify the instruments and develop the data system. “What we’re trying to determine is how fast are trees taking up carbon dioxide,” he said. “This rate differs for different trees, shrubs, grasses and other conditions. All have different uptake levels. It changes if the vegetation doesn’t have enough water, for example, or if it is healthy. We must represent that in or models. We have to understand the rates.” For more technology news, go to https://www.nasa.gov/content/news-and-information-0. NASA uses satellite lidar technology to study Earth’s forests, key carbon sinks.

From NASA Thanks in large part to satellite measurements, scientists' skill in measuring how much sea levels are rising on a global scale — currently 0.13 inch (3.4 millimeters) per year — has improved dramatically over the past quarter century. But at the local level, it's been harder to estimate specific regional sea level changes 10 or 20 years away - the critical timeframe for regional planners and decision makers. That's because sea level changes for many reasons, on differing timescales, and is not the same from one place to the next. Developing more accurate regional forecasts of sea level rise will therefore have far-reaching benefits for the more than 30 percent of Americans who currently reside along the Pacific, Atlantic or Gulf Coasts of the contiguous United States. New research published this week in the Journal of Climate reveals that one key measurement — large-scale upper-ocean temperature changes caused by natural cycles of the ocean — is a good indicator of regional coastal sea level changes on these decadal timescales. Such data may give planners and decision makers a new tool to identify key regions of U.S. coastlines that may be vulnerable to sea level changes on 10- to 20-year timescales. \"Decision makers need a diverse set of tools with different informational needs,\" said lead author Veronica Nieves of UCLA and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Having a better understanding of the chances of local flood damage from rising seas in coastal areas is a key factor in being able to assess vulnerability, risk and adaptation options.\" Such tools could help planners decide whether a given part of a coastline would be better served by \"soft\" techniques, such as beach replenishment or preservation of wetlands, or by \"hard\" techniques, such as construction of sea walls or levees. Nieves' team, which included participation from the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies in Esporles, Spain, set out to detect decadal sea level changes over large U.S. coastal ocean regions.

Clouds are both Earth's cooling sunshade and its insulating blanket. Currently their cooling effect prevails globally. But as Earth warms, the characteristics of clouds over different global regions — their thickness, brightness and height — are expected to change in ways that scientists don't fully understand. These changes could either amplify warming or slow it. Pinning down some of the uncertainties around clouds is one of the biggest challenges in determining the future rate of global climate change. The study used data from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite.

Credit: NASA. › Larger view By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Accurate weather forecasts save lives. NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument, launched on this date 15 years ago on NASA's Aqua satellite, significantly increased weather forecasting accuracy within a couple of years by providing extraordinary three-dimensional maps of clouds, air temperature and water vapor throughout the atmosphere's weather-making layer. Fifteen years later, AIRS continues to be a valuable asset for forecasters worldwide, sending 7 billion observations streaming into forecasting centers every day. Besides contributing to better forecasts, AIRS maps greenhouse gases, tracks volcanic emissions and smoke from wildfires, measures noxious compounds like ammonia, and indicates regions that may be heading for a drought. Have you been wondering how the ozone hole over Antarctica is healing? AIRS observes that too. These benefits come because AIRS sees many more wavelengths of infrared radiation in the atmosphere, and makes vastly more observations per day, than the observing systems that were previously available. Before AIRS launched, weather balloons provided the most significant weather observations. Previous infrared satellite instruments observed using about two dozen broad \"channels\" that averaged many wavelengths together. This reduced their ability to detect important vertical structure. Traditional weather balloons produce only a few thousand soundings (atmospheric vertical profiles) of temperature and water vapor a day, almost entirely over land. AIRS observes 100 times more wavelengths than the earlier instruments and produces close to 3 million soundings a day, covering 85 percent of the globe. AIRS observes 2,378 wavelengths of heat radiation in the air below the satellite. \"Having more wavelengths allows us to get finer vertical structure, and that gives us a much sharper picture of the atmosphere,\" explained AIRS Project Scientist Eric Fetzer of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Weather occurs in the troposphere, 7 to 12 miles high (11 to 19 kilometers). Most of the infrared radiation observed by AIRS also originates in the troposphere. AIRS was widely recognized as a great advance very quickly. Only three years after its launch, former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said AIRS provided \"the most significant increase in forecast improvement [in our time] of any single instrument.\" AIRS was the brainchild of NASA scientist Moustafa Chahine.

Over the last ten years, one-fourth of human-emissions of carbon dioxide as well as 90 percent of additional warming due to the greenhouse effect have been absorbed by the oceans. Acting like a massive sponge, the oceans pull from the atmosphere heat, carbon dioxide and other gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons, oxygen and nitrogen and store them in their depths for decades to centuries and millennia. New NASA research is one of the first studies to estimate how much and how quickly the ocean absorbs atmospheric gases and contrast it with the efficiency of heat absorption. Using two computer models that simulate the ocean, NASA and MIT scientists found that gases are more easily absorbed over time than heat energy. In addition, they found that in scenarios where the ocean current slows down due to the addition of heat, the ocean absorbs less of both atmospheric gases and heat, though its ability to absorb heat is more greatly reduced. The results were published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. “As the ocean slows down, it will keep uptaking gases like carbon dioxide more efficiently, much more than it will keep uptaking heat. It will have a different behavior for chemistry than it has for temperature,” said Anastasia Romanou, lead author and climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University in New York City.

    "content": "4 min read By Carol Rasmussen,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory A new NASA study shows that updrafts are more important than previously understood in determining what makes clouds produce drizzle instead of full-sized raindrops, overturning a common assumption. The study offers a pathway for improving accuracy in weather and climate models' treatments of rainfall — recognized as one of the greater challenges in improving short term weather forecasts and long-term climate projections. The research by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; UCLA; and the University of Tokyo found that low-lying clouds over the ocean produce more drizzle droplets than the same type of cloud over land. The results are published online in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society. Water droplets in clouds initially form on microscopic airborne particles, or aerosols. Scientists have been studying the role of aerosols in clouds and rain for decades. There are more aerosols over land than over the ocean, and scientists had thought the additional aerosols would tend to form more drizzle over land as well. The new study shows that the presence of aerosols alone can't explain where drizzle occurs. To understand what else plays a role, research team leader Hanii Takahashi of the JPL and UCLA Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering looked at updrafts — plumes of warm air rising from the solar-heated Earth. Within tall thunderclouds, strong updrafts play a role in rain formation. In low-lying clouds, however, updrafts are known to be much weaker, and they haven't received much scientific attention in connection with rain. \"There was a previous hypothesis that updrafts could be important,\" Takahashi said. \"But the hypothesis had never been tested, and I wasn't sure if updrafts were strong enough to affect the size of rain droplets.\" Within tall thunderclouds, strong updrafts play a role in rain formation. In low-lying clouds, however, updrafts are known to be much weaker, and they haven't received much scientific attention in connection with rain. Existing measurement systems struggle to monitor updraft velocities directly. To infer these velocities, Takahashi's team combined measurements from NASA's CloudSat and Aqua satellites and other sources with ground-level radar data from a U.S. Department of Energy observing site in the Azores. They found that the updrafts in low-lying clouds over land, while weaker than updrafts in tall thunderclouds, were still strong enough to keep drizzle droplets aloft. As the droplets floated within clouds, they continued to grow until the updrafts couldn't hold them up any longer. Then they fell as full-sized raindrops. In similar clouds that formed over the ocean, updrafts were even weaker than over land. As a result, droplets fell out of the clouds as drizzle, before they had the opportunity to grow into full-sized raindrops. This helps explain the preponderance of drizzle over the ocean. This finding gives new insight into the basic atmospheric process of rain formation, something that's helpful in both weather forecasting and climate modeling. Takahashi hopes it will help her fellow climate modelers look beyond aerosols in their assumptions about low-lying clouds. These clouds have a strong effect on projections of Earth's future surface temperatures. In most models, the assumptions currently used to obtain realistic surface temperatures result in an unrealistically drizzly world. \"If we make updraft velocities more realistic in the models, we might get both more realistic drizzle and more realistic surface temperature projections as a result,\" she said. Airborne water vapor molecules condense on aerosol particles called cloud condensation nuclei and grow into droplets of different sizes.

    "content": "4 min read By Ellen Gray,NASA's Earth Science News Team NASA's P-3 research plane begins flights this month through both clouds and smoke over the South Atlantic Ocean to understand how tiny airborne particles called aerosols change the properties of clouds and how they influence the amount of incoming sunlight the clouds reflect or absorb. The Observations of Aerosols above Clouds and their Interactions, or ORACLES, field mission is carrying out the month-long field campaign from São Tomé and Principé, an island nation off the west coast of Africa. From there researchers will investigate an area off the coast of Angola, where two phenomena meet. One is natural: a low-lying cloud bank that naturally forms over the ocean. The other is at least partly human-made: a plume of smoke from seasonal fires set on agricultural fields across central Africa. The short lifetime of aerosols in the atmosphere makes them among the most variable components of Earth’s climate system. An umbrella term for any small particle suspended in the atmosphere, aerosols can be either light or dark, reflective or absorbent of sunlight, and can enhance or suppress the formation of cloud droplets. They can be natural, like desert dust, sea salt or pollen. They can also result from human activities, such as sulfate particles which form from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide emitted from power plants, or, as is the case in Central Africa, soot and ash from human-made fires. “Imagine a plume of smoke,” said ORACLES Principal Investigator Jens Redemann of NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. \"If you see it over the contrast of a dark ocean, it looks lighter, which means the aerosols making up the smoke would have a cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere – they reflect more radiation.\" In contrast, \"if you look at those aerosol particles over a cloud deck, they make the clouds appear darker sometimes, and that would have a warming effect at the top of the atmosphere,\" he said. The sheer variety of aerosol particle types and the fact that they stay in the atmosphere for just days to weeks, compared to years spent by greenhouse gases, means they are among the most challenging to understand and incorporate into climate models, said Redemann, which is why the data collected from the P-3 aircraft measurements of aerosols and clouds are so important. \"Ideally, we’re going to create a data set climate modelers can use to test their parameterization of these cloud-aerosol interactions,\" said Redemann. \"So ten years from now, someone can go back and say, 'OK, I wonder if these guys collected data on mechanisms A, B, C and I can use that to get the mechanisms correct in my model.'\" One of those climate modelers is Susanne Bauer at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, who is also a member of the ORACLES science team. \"In order to develop climate models, we have to consider microphysical processes, such as how a cloud droplet gets formed and how such droplets and physical conditions inside and outside of a cloud are changed by the presence of aerosols,\" she said. \"These can only be measured in the field.\" Those microscopic interactions between particles and droplets have multiple effects. In addition to direct effects like absorbing or reflecting sunlight, Bauer said, \"they can change how much sunlight a cloud reflects back to space and the lifetime of a cloud. Possibly they can influence if it's raining or if a cloud will start to drizzle.\" Understanding these small-scale processes is crucial to gaining knowledge about how human-made pollution is changing the climate globally via cloud effects. NASA's P-3 research aircraft, managed at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, is outfitted with a suite of instruments to directly measure these and other properties from air drawn into the plane through inlets on the sides and wings. Each instrument is operated by small groups of scientists who make up the ORACLES research team. \"The work we do can only be done by a large, dedicated team,” said Bernadette Squire Luna, ORACLES project manager at Ames, who manages the logistics for the nearly one hundred scientists who will be rotating through São Tomé in August. “We have scientists from five NASA centers, ten universities and two national labs, as well as new international partnerships.\" The August",

A new study with NASA participation finds that land ecosystems took progressively longer to recover from droughts in the 20th century, and incomplete drought recovery may become the new normal in some areas, possibly leading to tree death and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. In results published Aug. 10 in the journal Nature, a research team led by Christopher Schwalm of Woods Hole Research Center, Falmouth, Massachusetts, and including a scientist from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, measured recovery time following droughts in various regions of the world. They used projections from climate models verified by observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite and ground measurements. The researchers found that drought recovery was taking longer in all land areas. In two particularly vulnerable regions — the tropics and northern high latitudes — recovery took ever longer than in other regions. Schwalm noted that in model projections that assumed no new restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions (the so-called business-as-usual scenario), \"Time between drought events will likely become shorter than the time needed for land ecosystems to recover from them.\" \"Using the vantage point of space, we can see all of Earth's forests and other ecosystems getting hit repeatedly and increasingly by droughts,\" said study co-author Josh Fisher of JPL. \"Some of these ecosystems recover, but, with increasing frequency, others do not. Data from our 'eyes' in space allow us to verify our simulations of past and current climate, which, in turn, helps us reduce uncertainties in projections of future climate.\" The scientists argue that recovery time is a crucial metric for assessing the resilience of ecosystems, shaping the odds of crossing a tipping point after which trees begin to die. Shorter times between droughts, combined with longer drought recovery times, may lead to widespread tree death, decreasing the ability of land areas to absorb atmospheric carbon.

    "content": "5 min read By Kasha Patel,NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center We live on a solar-powered planet. As we wake up in the morning, the Sun peeks over the horizon to shed light on us, blanket us with warmth and provide cues to start our day. At the same time, our Sun’s energy drives our planet’s ocean currents, seasons, weather and climate. Without the Sun, life on Earth would not exist. For nearly 40 years, NASA has been measuring how much sunshine powers our home planet. This December, NASA is launching an instrument to the International Space Station to continue monitoring the Sun’s energy input to the Earth system. The Total and Spectral solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS-1) will precisely measure what scientists call “total solar irradiance.” These data will give us a better understanding of Earth’s primary energy supply and help improve models simulating Earth’s climate. “You can look at the Earth and Sun connection as a simple energy balance. If you have more energy absorbed by the Earth than leaving it, its temperature increases and vice versa,” said Peter Pilewskie, TSIS-1 lead scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric Physics (LASP) in Boulder, Colorado. Under NASA’s direction, LASP is providing and distributing the instrument’s measurements to the scientific community. “We’re measuring all the radiant energy that is coming to Earth.” But it’s not so simple: the Sun’s output energy is not constant. Over the course of about 11 years, our Sun cycles from a relatively quiet state to a peak in intense solar activity — like explosions of light and solar material — called a solar maximum. In subsequent years the Sun returns to a quiet state and the cycle starts over again. The Sun has fewer sunspots — dark areas that are often the source of increased solar activity — and stops producing so many explosions, going through a period called the solar minimum. Over the course of one solar cycle (one 11-year period), the Sun’s emitted energy varies on average at about 0.1 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but the Sun emits a large amount of energy – 1,361 watts per square meter. Even fluctuations at just a tenth of a percent can affect Earth. In addition to those 11-year changes, entire solar cycles can vary from decade to decade. Scientists have observed unusually quiet magnetic activity from the Sun for the past two decades with previous satellites. During the last prolonged solar minimum in",

    "content": "By Denise Lineberry NASA Langley Research Center On August 30, NASA’s North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) returned to air and sea to research the declining, or deaccelerating, phase of the annual cycle of plankton in the North Atlantic. Since plankton form the base of the marine food web and impact the productivity of fisheries, understanding this declining phase is important to forecasting the future. Plankton are strongly interconnected with climate and life on Earth. NAAMES scientists already have discovered shifts in plankton rates that give rise to an early winter bloom with a climax in late spring. For the next five weeks, NASA’s C-130 aircraft will make several instrumented flights above the North Atlantic, where it will rendezvous with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute’s research vessel Atlantis, which serves as a floating laboratory. By combining ship, airborne, computer modeling, sustained satellite and autonomous sensor data, NAAMES scientists hope to improve predictions of Earth system processes and inform ocean management and assessment of ecosystem change. “It’s hard to imagine that organisms you can’t see make a difference, and we all kind of struggle with that,” said Mike Behrenfeld, NAAMES principal investigator from Oregon State University. “You look out in the ocean and you see water, but that water is just teeming with millions and millions of tiny organisms, and when you sum them up, they have a huge impact.” Each year, the annual cycle of the plankton follows four primary phases, including the declining and climax phases, and two transition periods. It is scientists' incomplete understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these events that is the basis for some conflicting bloom hypotheses. NAAMES aims to reconcile this conflict through its comprehensive, multi-season observational strategy. And after two successful NAAMES studies in summer and winter, and more than a decade of NASA satellite observations, this fall study is helping the team to build a clearer picture of this repeated cycle and what controls it. “Fall is the deaccelerating cycle just after the bloom climax that occurred in summer,” Behrenfeld said. The days are shorter. The temperatures have decreased. And the surface mix layer where the nutrients, sunlight, and biology lives is deepening, making it more difficult for the plankton to eat and get sunlight. “It is an interesting line we’re dancing along when you have potential for input of nutrients, and at the same time, the light is declining,” Behrenfeld said. “This declining phase could create conditions for another blooming phase in fall or winter.” With it being hurricane season, the team is expecting some rough waters. But they plan to make good of the rough seas by studying the episodic, short-term effect that strong storms can have on plankton populations. NAAMES will continue to study how the ocean and the atmosphere are connected. Plankton are an important carbon sink for atmospheric greenhouse gases, and the growth of plankton depends on carbon. Moreover, a warmer ocean holds less carbon. “Atmospheric aerosol particles have a distinct fingerprint of ocean biology,” said Rich Moore, NAAMES deputy project scientist from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Those fingerprints will help the team study whether or not the death and decay of ocean biology increases organics in aerosols during the annual declining phase. This is of interest because organic aerosols from ocean biology provide a unique opportunity for droplets to form in the atmosphere. The North Atlantic atmosphere is generally composed of biogenic aerosols that do not form droplets in the air. Phytoplankton produce a gas called Dimethyl sulfide, or DMS, and as that it passes into the atmosphere, it rapidly breaks down. The resulting sulfur compounds become aerosols, or microscopic particles in the atmosphere. When water condenses around a collection of these aerosols, they form clouds. The North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) is an interdisciplinary investigation resolving key processes controlling marine ecosystems and aerosols that are essential to our understanding of Earth system function and future change. NAAMES is funded by the NASA Earth Venture Suborbital Program and is the first EV-S mission focused on studying the coupled ocean ecosystem and atmosphere. The fourth and final NAAMES study will take place in spring of",

    "content": "7 min read By Joe AtkinsonNASA Langley Research Center It was a pretty typical day for NASA scientists studying pollution in the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia — busy, in other words. And for good reason. The work they were doing could help improve air-quality forecasts in a region where the air quality picture isn’t totally clear. Over the course of a few hours, measurements would pour in from several different sensors at several locations in the lower Chesapeake Bay — sometimes simultaneously, sometimes one right after another. Sensors were installed on a C-23 Sherpa aircraft, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), a balloon, ground-based lidar stations, a maritime research vessel and automobile-based sensors. And that’s just to name a few. The sensors sampled the atmosphere at different altitudes and locations. They sometimes sampled the exact same locations at the exact same time to validate one another’s data. They were all on the hunt for one thing: ozone. That trace gas is the star of the Ozone Water-Land Environmental Transition Study (OWLETS), a NASA study looking at ozone concentrations around the lower Chesapeake Bay. The ozone these scientists are measuring isn’t the stuff way up in the stratosphere. Ozone there is beneficial. It blocks out cancer-causing, crop-damaging ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The ozone these scientists are measuring is closer to the ground, swirling around in the air we breathe, and in high concentrations, it’s bad. Ground-level ozone gets created when emissions from cars, power plants, wildfire smoke, and other sources chemically react in sunlight. It can seriously diminish air quality and negatively affect people’s health. Ozone is known to aggravate existing breathing problems such as asthma and can cause lung damage. Children and senior citizens are especially at risk from ozone exposure. There haven’t been many studies of ozone around the Chesapeake Bay, but what few studies there have been have suggested that maybe — just maybe — ozone concentrations are higher over the water than the surrounding land. “It wasn’t a complete story,” said Tim Berkoff, principal investigator for OWLETS at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, which is located in Hampton Roads. “And so that was something of interest, because if you have high ozone over water it can potentially impact air quality over land through bay breeze recirculation effects. The air goes out in the morning and comes back in the afternoon, and if you’re photochemically cooking all this ozone over water it can potentially then be brought back over high population areas.” Other cities in Hampton Roads include Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Newport News.

    "content": "3 min read Researchers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the University of California, Irvine, have reported the first detection of sea level “fingerprints” in ocean observations: detectable patterns of sea level variability around the world resulting from changes in water storage on Earth’s continents and in the mass of ice sheets. The results will give scientists confidence they can use these data to determine how much the sea level will rise at any point on the global ocean as a result of glacier ice melt. As ice sheets and glaciers undergo climate-related melting, they alter Earth’s gravity field, resulting in sea level changes that aren’t uniform around the globe. For example, when a glacier loses ice mass, its gravitational attraction is reduced. Ocean waters nearby move away, causing sea level to rise faster far away from the glacier. The resulting pattern of sea level change is known as a sea level fingerprint. Certain regions, particularly in Earth’s middle and low latitudes, are hit harder, and Greenland and Antarctica contribute differently to the process. For instance, sea level rise in California and Florida generated by the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is up to 52 percent greater than its average effect on the rest of the world. To calculate sea level fingerprints associated with the loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets and from changes in land water storage, the team used gravity data collected by the twin satellites of the U.S./German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) between April",

A satellite no bigger than a shoebox may one day help. Small enough to fit inside a backpack, the aptly named RainCube (Radar in a CubeSat) uses experimental technology to see storms by detecting rain and snow with very small instruments. The people behind the miniature mission celebrated after RainCube sent back its first images of a storm over Mexico in a technology demonstration in August. Its second wave of images in September caught the first rainfall of Hurricane Florence. The small satellite is a prototype for a possible fleet of RainCubes that could one day help monitor severe storms, lead to improving the accuracy of weather forecasts and track climate change over time. \"We don't have any way of measuring how water and air move in thunderstorms globally,\" said Graeme Stephens, director of the Center of Climate Sciences at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"We just don't have any information about that at all, yet it's so essential for predicting severe weather and even how rains will change in a future climate.\" RainCube is a type of \"tech demo,\" an experiment to see if shrinking a weather radar into a low-cost, miniature satellite could still provide a real-time look inside storms. RainCube \"sees\" objects by using radar, much as a bat uses sonar. The satellite's umbrella-like antenna sends out chirps, or specialized radar signals, that bounce off raindrops, bringing back a picture of what the inside of the storm looks like. Engineers like Principal Investigator Eva Peral had to figure out a way to help a small spacecraft send a signal strong enough to peer into a storm. \"The radar signal penetrates the storm, and then the radar receives back an echo,\" said Peral. \"As the radar signal goes deeper into the layers of the storm and measures the rain at those layers, we get a snapshot of the activity inside the storm.\" RainCube was deployed into low-Earth orbit from the International Space Station in July. The first images it sent back were from an area above Mexico, where it took a snapshot of a developing storm in August. \"There's a plethora of ground-based experiments that have provided an enormous amount of information, and that's why our weather forecasts nowadays are not that bad,\" said Simone Tanelli, the co-investigator for RainCube. \"But they don't provide a global view. Also, there are weather satellites that provide such a global view, but what they are not telling you is what's happening inside the storm. And that's where the processes that make a storm grow and/or decay happen.\" But RainCube is not meant to fulfill a mission of tracking storms all by itself. It is just the first demonstration that a mini-rain radar could work. Because RainCube is miniaturized, making it less expensive to launch, many more of the satellites could be sent into orbit. Flying together like geese, they could track storms, relaying updated information on them every few minutes. Eventually, they could yield data to help evaluate and improve weather models that predict the movement of rain, snow, sleet and hail. \"We actually will end up doing much more interesting insightful science with a constellation rather than with just one of them,\" Stephens said. \"What we're learning in Earth sciences is that space and time coverage is more important than having a really expensive satellite instrument that just does one thing.\" And that future seems closer now that RainCube and other Earth-observing CubeSats like it have proved they can work. \"What RainCube offers on the one hand is a demonstration of measurements that we currently have in space today,\" said Stephens. \"But what it really demonstrates is the potential for an entirely new and different way of observing Earth with many small radars. That will open up a whole new vista in viewing the hydrological cycle of Earth.\" RainCube is a technology-demonstration mission to enable Ka-band precipitation radar technologies on a low-cost, quick-turnaround platform. It is sponsored by NASA's Earth Science Technology Office through the InVEST-15 program. JPL is working with Tyvak Nanosatellite Systems, Inc. in Irvine, California, to fly the RainCube mission.

In a cooperative arrangement meant to improve understanding of both narwhal behavior and melting glaciers, the data gathered by tagged narwhals will help fill an important scientific goal in a NASA project called Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG). This multipronged endeavor seeks precision data on where, how, and how fast the relatively warm ocean waters are melting Greenland’s ice. NASA is attacking the problem by ship, plane and floating sensor. But measuring the ocean near Greenland’s glaciers can be a major challenge even from a ship because of heavy sea ice and fjords choked with icebergs. That’s where the narwhals come in. “In the summer, the sea ice melts away and narwhals migrate to remote fjords in Melville Bay” in northwest Greenland, said Ian Fenty, a NASA oceanographer who studies sea level and ice. “Narwhals spend time feeding in the waters in front of the glaciers – exactly where we need ocean measurements for OMG.” Much of the Greenland coast is ice-free only a few times a year – a major barrier to scientific investigation of ice melt and ocean-water variability. “Very few people live in northwest Greenland and so historically very little of the ocean has been mapped up there,” Fenty said. “There’s a huge data hole that we need to fill to learn why the glaciers in that region are melting.” So when Fenty learned of a paper Laidre published in",

    "content": "5 min read By Carol Rasmussen,NASA's Earth Science News Team Study Bolsters Theory of Heat Source Under West Antarctica A new NASA study adds evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctica's Marie Byrd Land, explaining some of the melting that creates lakes and rivers under the ice sheet. Although the heat source isn't a new or increasing threat to the West Antarctic ice sheet, it may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed rapidly in an earlier era of rapid climate change, and why it is so unstable today. The stability of an ice sheet is closely related to how much water lubricates it from below, allowing glaciers to slide more easily. Understanding the sources and future of the meltwater under West Antarctica is important for estimating the rate at which ice may be lost to the ocean in the future. Antarctica's bedrock is laced with rivers and lakes, the largest of which is the size of Lake Erie. Many lakes fill and drain rapidly, forcing the ice surface thousands of feet above them to rise and fall by as much as 20 feet (6 meters). The motion allows scientists to estimate where and how much water must exist at the base. Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature. Very recent seismic imaging has supported this concept. When Hélène Seroussi of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, first heard the idea, however, \"I thought it was crazy,\" she said. \"I didn't see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it.\" With few direct measurements existing from under the ice, Seroussi and Erik Ivins of JPL concluded the best way to study the mantle plume idea was by numerical modeling. They used the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a numerical depiction of the physics of ice sheets developed by scientists at JPL and the University of California, Irvine. Seroussi enhanced the ISSM to capture natural sources of heating and heat transport from freezing, melting and liquid water; friction; and other processes. To assure the model was realistic, the scientists drew on observations of changes in the altitude of the ice sheet surface made by NASA's IceSat satellite and airborne Operation IceBridge campaign. \"These place a powerful constraint on allowable melt rates — the very thing we wanted to predict,\" Ivins said. Since the location and size of the possible mantle plume were unknown, they tested a full range of what was physically possible for multiple parameters, producing dozens of different simulations. They found that the flux of energy from the mantle plume must be no more than 150 milliwatts per square meter. For comparison, in U.S. regions with no volcanic activity, the heat flux from Earth's mantle is 40 to 60 milliwatts. Under Yellowstone National Park — a well-known geothermal hot spot — the heat from below is about 200 milliwatts per square meter averaged over the entire park, though individual geothermal features such as geysers are much hotter. Seroussi and Ivins' simulations using a heat flow higher than 150 milliwatts per square meter showed too much melting to be compatible with the space-based data, except in one location: an area inland of the Ross Sea known for intense flows of water. This region required a heat flow of at least 150-180 milliwatts per square meter to agree with the observations. However, seismic imaging has shown that mantle heat in this region may reach the ice sheet through a rift, that is, a fracture in Earth's crust such as appears in Africa's Great Rift Valley. Mantle plumes are thought to be narrow streams of hot rock rising through Earth's mantle and spreading out like a mushroom cap under the crust. The buoyancy of the material, some of it molten, causes the crust to bulge upward. The theory of mantle plumes was proposed in the",

And it is likely a strong confirmation of sea-level “fingerprints,” one of the most counter-intuitive effects of large-scale melting: As ice vanishes, the loss of its gravitational pull lowers sea level nearby, even as sea level rises farther away. The result could be an early indication of an expected acceleration of global sea level, long predicted by computer models of Earth’s climate. “If the climate scenarios are correct, we would expect to see an acceleration,” said James Davis of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York. “During this 25-year period (since",

Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow, short-lived jets of air that transport water vapor across significant portions of Earth's mid-latitude oceans, onto the continents and into Earth’s polar regions. Previous studies recognized that atmospheric rivers can have profound effects on precipitation, floods and snowpack on land — collectively known as hydrology — but these studies were limited to very specific regions. The new study is a first attempt to determine how extensively atmospheric rivers affect global hydrology. Like tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers are a form of extreme weather that affects many areas of the globe. The new study conservatively estimates that, on average, at least 300 million people around the world are exposed to floods and droughts linked to atmospheric rivers each year. And while the percentage of Earth’s population affected by atmospheric river storms is relatively small, their effects are quite significant. The study authors found that globally, precipitation from atmospheric rivers contributes 22 percent of the total water that flows across Earth’s land surfaces. In certain regions — such as the west and east coasts of North America; Southeast Asia; and New Zealand — that contribution can exceed 50 percent. These impacts come from just a handful of atmospheric river storms each year. Around the world, in places where their influence is strongest, atmospheric rivers make floods and droughts far more likely — increasing the occurrence of floods by 80 percent in those areas, while their absence may increase the occurrence of droughts by up to 90 percent. Earlier research on atmospheric rivers focused largely on two types of impacts from these systems. First, early studies in the",

Researchers at the University of California at Irvine (UCI), NASA and 30 other institutions have published the most comprehensive, accurate and high-resolution relief maps ever made of Greenland's bedrock and coastal seafloor. Among the many data sources incorporated into the new maps are data from NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) campaign. Lead author Mathieu Morlighem of UCI had demonstrated in an earlier paper that data from OMG's survey of the shape and depth, or bathymetry, of the seafloor in Greenland's fjords improved scientists' understanding not only of the coastline, but of the inland bedrock beneath glaciers that flow into the ocean. That's because the bathymetry where a glacier meets the ocean limits the possibilities for the shape of bedrock farther upstream. The nearer to the shoreline, the more valuable the bathymetry data are for understanding on-shore topography, Morlighem said. \"What made OMG unique compared to other campaigns is that they got right into the fjords, as close as possible to the glacier fronts. That's a big help for bedrock mapping.\" Additionally, the OMG campaign surveyed large sections of the Greenland coast for the first time ever. In fjords for which there are no data, it's difficult to estimate how deep the glaciers extend below sea level. The OMG data are only one of many datasets Morlighem and his team used in the ice sheet mapper, which is named BedMachine. Another comprehensive source is NASA's Operation IceBridge airborne surveys. IceBridge measures the ice sheet thickness directly along a plane's flight path. This creates a set of long, narrow strips of data rather than a complete map of the ice sheet. Besides NASA, nearly 40 other international collaborators also contributed various types of survey data on different parts of Greenland. No survey, not even OMG, covers every glacier on Greenland's long, convoluted coastline. To infer the bed topography in sparsely studied areas, BedMachine averages between existing data points using physical principles such as the conservation of mass. The new maps reveal that two to four times more oceanfront glaciers extend deeper than 600 feet (200 meters) below sea level than earlier maps showed. That's bad news, because the top 600 feet of water around Greenland comes from the Arctic and is relatively cold. The water below it comes from farther south and is 6 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 4 degrees Celsius) warmer than the water above. Deeper-seated glaciers are exposed to this warmer water, which melts them more rapidly. Morlighem's team used the maps to refine their estimate of Greenland's total volume of ice and its potential to add to global sea level rise, if the ice were to melt completely -- which is not expected to occur within the next few hundred years. The new estimate is higher by 2.76 inches (7 centimeters) for a total of 24.34 feet (7.42 meters). OMG Principal Investigator Josh Willis of JPL, who was not involved in producing the maps, said, \"These results suggest that Greenland's ice is more threatened by changing climate than we had anticipated.\" On Oct. 23, the five-year OMG campaign completed its second annual set of airborne surveys to measure, for the first time, the amount that warm water around the island is contributing to the loss of the Greenland ice sheet. Besides the one-time bathymetry survey, OMG is collecting annual measurements of the changing height of the ice sheet and the ocean temperature and salinity in more than 200 fjord locations. Morlighem looks forward to improving BedMachine's maps with data from the airborne surveys. The maps and related research are in a paper titled \"BedMachine v3: Complete bed topography and ocean bathymetry mapping of Greenland from multi-beam echo sounding combined with mass conservation\" in Geophysical Research Letters.

Tiny particles, known as aerosols, are carried by winds around the globe. This visualization uses data from NASA satellites combined with our knowledge of physics and meteorology to track three aerosols: dust, smoke, and sea salt. Sea salt, shown here in blue, is picked up by winds passing over the ocean. As tropical storms and hurricanes form, the salt particles are concentrated into the spiraling shape we all recognize. With their movements, we can follow the formation of Hurricane Irma and see the dust from the Sahara, shown in tan, get washed out of the storm center by the rain. Advances in computing speed allow scientists to include more details of these physical processes in their simulations of how the aerosols interact with the storm systems. The increased resolution of the computer simulation is apparent in fine details like the hurricane bands spiraling counter-clockwise. Computer simulations let us see how different processes fit together and evolve as a system. By using mathematical models to represent nature we can separate the system into component parts and better understand the underlying physics of each.

    "content": "4 min read By Pat Brennan,NASA's Sea Level Change Portal A new NASA tool links changes in sea level in 293 global port cities to specific regions of melting land ice, such as southern Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula. It is intended to help coastal planners prepare for rising seas in the decades to come. All coastal cities will see some impacts of global sea level rise. But the new tool shows that, for example, New York City is more strongly affected by melting ice in northeastern Greenland than in southwestern Greenland; while Sydney has a greater risk from the rapidly melting Antarctic Peninsula than from East Antarctica. A paper describing the new tool, titled \"Should coastal planners have concern over where land ice is melting?,\" was recently published in the journal Science Advances. The research team is Eric Larour, Erik Ivins and Surendra Adhikari of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Melting ice and rising ocean temperatures contribute about evenly to global sea level rise today. Individual cities are also affected by local conditions such as land sinking. Other Web-based resources such as the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit address some of these issues, but the new NASA tool is the only resource to match specific melting ice locations with their effects on the world's ports. Water from melted ice on land doesn't spread evenly across the world's oceans because of a gravitational push-pull between ice and ocean. As a melting glacier or ice sheet dwindles, it loses mass, causing its local gravitational pull on nearby ocean water to diminish. Seawater that had been pulled toward the ice by the force of gravity flows away — in other words, sea level drops in the vicinity of a melting glacier but rises farther away. When this spatial pattern can be attributed to a given glacier or ice sheet, it is known as a sea level fingerprint. To calculate this and other influences on sea level such as Earth's rotation, Larour and his colleagues used a dynamic mathematical formula called the adjoint method, which is used in seismic and meteorological studies. The method enables fast computation of the sensitivity of a model's output to its inputs — in this case, the sensitivity of sea level to ice melting. They used the method with JPL's well-tested computer model of ice sheet melting, the Ice Sheet System Model, to develop their new tool, called Gradient Fingerprint Mapping. Users of the tool need no specialized training or extreme computer power; they simply download it, input data or projections of ice loss, and let it evolve the shifting ice and water patterns forward into the future. The result: a detailed profile of the sensitivity of sea level at any of these cities to changes in ice anywhere in the world. Calculations of sea level fingerprints have been made in previous studies but tended to be cumbersome and spatially coarse, Larour said. The new tool provides an overall mechanism for rapidly computing high-resolution results using a variety of potential data sets. Gradient Fingerprint Mapping is not dependent on a particular climate change scenario, Larour said. \"You can apply the method to any type of melting scenario that you want.\" That means it will retain its utility as improved projections of ice loss become available in the future. The computations show that the specific location of mass loss in Greenland is crucial, as it greatly affects the local sea level predictions for many major coastal cities in North America and Europe. The spatial details of Antarctic melting are important for areas south of the equator in South America, Africa and South Asia. Among some intriguing results, Larour said, are those for New York, London and Oslo. Greenland’s northeastern ice stream was shown to have an outsized effect on New York’s local sea level, but the island's southern glaciers had little influence. London was more strongly affected by Greenland’s northwestern and western glaciers. And Norway is so close to Greenland, the island's gravitational fingerprint is contributing to sea level decrease in Oslo. The authors note that ocean dynamics can accelerate or offset the changes in sea level from gravitational fingerprints — particularly in New York, where the contribution of melting ice to accelerated sea level rise is minor compared to other sources. “This is really a new capability,” Larour said. “Now a coastal planner can understand and see how the melting or growing of a given ice sheet could be detrimental or beneficial to a specific location.” Access the tool at: https://vesl.jpl.nasa.gov/research/sea-level/slr-gfm News media contact Alan BuisJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California818-354-",

Credit: NASA By Alan Buis, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Steve Cole NASA Headquarters NASA's Aquarius instrument has successfully completed its commissioning phase and is now \"tasting\" the saltiness of Earth's ocean surface, making measurements from its perch in near-polar orbit. \"This marks the end of the long odyssey to design, build and launch this mission, and the start of a new journey of scientific exploration,\" said Aquarius Principal Investigator Gary Lagerloef of Earth & Space Research, Seattle. \"Scientists from around the world are ready and waiting to study this important new satellite measurement for ocean and climate research.\" The Aquarius/SAC-D (Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas) observatory, a collaboration between NASA and Argentina's space agency, Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), launched from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on June 10 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket and was placed in its proper initial orbit. Ground controllers at the SAC-D Mission Operations Center in Teófilo Tabanera Space Center in Cordoba, Argentina, then began a complete in-orbit checkout of all SAC-D spacecraft systems. With all observatory systems confirmed to be healthy, SAC-D spacecraft commissioning activities were completed on July 24. The spacecraft's propulsion system then underwent a series of tests, and preliminary orbit adjustments were performed in preparation for turning on the observatory's eight science instruments. Aquarius will make NASA's first space observations of the salinity, or concentration of salt, at the ocean surface, a key variable in satellite studies of Earth. Variations in salinity influence the ocean's deep circulation, outline the path freshwater takes around our planet and help drive Earth's climate. On Aug. 14, the Aquarius Instrument Flight Operations Team, together with the SAC-D Mission Flight Operations Team, began powering up the Aquarius instrument, and successfully completed deployment of the Aquarius antenna on Aug. 17. The team then began sequentially powering on the instrument's subsystems. On Aug. 20, the Aquarius radiometer, which collects the brightness temperature data from which salinity measurements are derived, was powered on for the first time in space and transmitted its first science data back to Earth, which were analyzed and found to be as expected. On Aug. 21, the team began powering on Aquarius' radar scatterometer, which corrects for the effects of ocean roughness on the radiometer readings. Commissioning of Aquarius was completed and regular data collection began on Aug. 24. The Aquarius science team will spend the coming months analyzing and calibrating the measurements and releasing preliminary data. With the Aquarius instrument commissioning now complete, the SAC-D Instruments Flight Operations Teams, together with the SAC-D Mission Flight Operations Team in Argentina, are now engaged in commissioning the other seven SAC-D instruments. Once all the observatory instruments are commissioned, a maneuver will be conducted to place Aquarius/SAC-D in its final orbit, 408 miles (657 kilometers) above Earth. Aquarius was built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. NASA's Launch Services Program, at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, managed the launch. JPL is managing Aquarius through its commissioning phase and will archive mission data. Goddard will manage Aquarius mission operations and process science data. CONAE is providing the SAC-D spacecraft, an optical camera, a thermal camera with Canada, a microwave radiometer, other sensors and the mission operations center.

Plants grow and thrive through photosynthesis, a process that converts sunlight into energy. During photosynthesis, plants emit what is called fluorescence – light invisible to the naked eye but detectable by satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above Earth. NASA scientists have now established a method to turn this satellite data into global maps of the subtle phenomenon in more detail than ever before. Healthy plants use the energy from sunlight to perform photosynthesis, and re-emit some of that light as a faint but measureable glow. In short, abundant fluorescence indicates active photosynthesis and a well functioning plant, while low or no fluorescence can mean that the plant is stressed or shutting down. Maps of the phenomenon give scientists a direct look at plant health.

    "date": null,
    "content": "From NASA Scientists recently completed test flights with prototypes of potential satellite sensors - including two from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California — over the Western United States, probing basic science questions about aerosols, clouds, air quality and global ocean ecosystems. The flight campaign, called Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL), sought to test capabilities of several proposed instruments for the Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystem (ACE) pre-formulation study. Aerosols are small solid or liquid particles suspended in Earth's atmosphere, like fine dust, smoke, pollen or soot. These particles scatter and absorb sunlight and are critical to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Scientists can analyze this scattered light using instruments like polarimeters, which measure the color and polarization of the scattered light, and lidars, which use lasers to probe the atmosphere. Together these data sets provide key information about aerosol properties, including size, shape and chemical composition — information that provides a better understanding and assessment of their effects on weather, climate and air quality. Prior to being launched into space, airborne versions of satellite sensors typically take a test ride on NASA's ER-2 high-altitude aircraft. The platform, based at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, flies at altitudes of up to 70,000 feet (21,336 meters), and provides a vantage point and conditions similar to space. By flying these instruments on an aircraft before the expense of launching them into space, scientists and engineers can make adjustments to the hardware and data retrieval algorithms. The ER-2 also enables scientists to observe specific events of interest, like wildfires or volcanic eruptions, to gain a more comprehensive collection of different types of aerosols in different conditions. The aircraft test phase in sensor development is helpful for ensuring instruments are collecting both accurate and useful data prior to the time the final version of the sensors makes its trip into space. In addition to testing capabilities of new sensors, ACEPOL flights also provided calibration and evaluation data for NASA's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite lidar by staging satellite underpasses as part of their flight plans. In addition to comparisons with CALIPSO, ACEPOL also contributes to the development of future satellite missions, including the European Space Agency's EarthCare, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites' Meteorological Operational Satellite - Second Generation (METOP-SG), and NASA's Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) and Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) programs. MAIA is being built and is managed by JPL. The team completed nine flights that wrapped up in mid-November, observing targets such as California's Central Valley and the Pacific Ocean, and as far east as Arizona, where the team observed smoke from controlled forest fires near Flagstaff. The ER-2's payload included four airborne polarimeters — Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP), JPL's Airborne Multi-angle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), Airborne Spectropolarimeter for Planetary Exploration (AirSPEX) and Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) — and two lidar instruments - Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) and High Spectral Resolution Lidar-2 (HSRL-2). Each of the polarimeters used different techniques and angles to measure and record data. The instruments also differed from one another in size and power. From an engineering perspective, the ultimate goal of the ACEPOL mission was to better understand how those overall differences translate into data collection. The combination of the polarimeter and lidar instruments, along with ground-based data from stationary air quality measurement stations, provide scientists with a more complete picture of the three-dimensional distribution of aerosols in Earth's atmosphere. Using a variety of different approaches for collecting data also enables scientists to differentiate between various types of aerosols (e.g., smoke, dust, pollution) and clouds (cirrus, stratus, etc.). The ACEPOL mission involved partnership between multiple NASA centers, including Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City; and JPL. The mission also included international partnership with the Netherlands Institute for Space Research, which flew the AirSPEX instrument on board the ER-2 for the second time. The instrument made its maiden flight on the ER-2 in January",

    "content": "4 min read By Carol Rasmussen,NASA's Earth Science News Team A new study has found that dust, not spring warmth, controls the pace of spring snowmelt that feeds the headwaters of the Colorado River. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the amount of dust on the mountain snowpack controls how fast the Colorado Basin's rivers rise in the spring regardless of air temperature, with more dust correlated with faster spring runoff and higher peak flows. The finding is valuable for western water managers and advances our understanding of how freshwater resources, in the form of snow and ice, will respond to warming temperatures in the future. By improving knowledge of what controls the melting of snow, it improves understanding of the controls on how much solar heat Earth reflects back into space and how much it absorbs — an important factor in studies of weather and climate. When snow gets covered by a layer of windblown dust or soot, the dark topcoat increases the amount of heat the snow absorbs from sunlight. Tom Painter of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has been researching the consequences of dust on snowmelt worldwide. This is the first study to focus on which has a stronger influence on spring runoff: warmer air temperatures or a coating of dust on the snow. Windblown dust has increased in the U.S. Southwest as a result of changing climate patterns and human land-use decisions. With rainfall decreasing and more disturbances of the land, protective crusts on soil are removed and more bare soil is exposed. Winter and spring winds pick up the dusty soil and drop it on the Colorado Rockies to the northeast. Historical lake sediment analyses show there is currently an annual average of five to seven times more dust falling on the Rocky Mountain snowpack than there was before the mid-",

The animation focuses on the Russian fires, while the animation highlights the global transport of the pollution across the northern hemisphere, as seen from above the North Pole. The highest concentrations of carbon monoxide are shown in yellows and reds. › Larger view NASA's satellite instruments are often the first to detect wildfires burning in remote regions, and the locations of new fires are sent directly to land managers worldwide within hours of the satellite overpass. Together, NASA instruments, including a number built and managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, detect actively burning fires, track the transport of smoke from fires, provide information for fire management, and map the extent of changes to ecosystems, based on the extent and severity of burn scars. NASA has a fleet of Earth-observing instruments, many of which contribute to our understanding of fire in the Earth system. Satellites in orbit around the poles provide observations of the entire planet several times per day, whereas satellites in a geostationary orbit provide coarse-resolution imagery of fires, smoke and clouds every five to 15 minutes. \"NASA's satellite, airborne and field research capture the full impact of fires in the Earth system, from rapid detection of actively burning fires, transport of smoke and changes in ecosystems in the days to decades following fire,\" said Doug Morton, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Much of the remote-sensing data that NASA collects on wildfires is quickly put to work in aiding disaster response efforts around the world. The NASA Earth Science Disasters Program supports this application science and mobilizes for global intensive risk events that span a range of natural hazards — not only wildfires but earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, landslides, severe weather, winter storms, tropical cyclones and volcanoes. Over the last two years, NASA's Disasters Program has ramped up to build infrastructure and continue to forge new relationships between international, regional and local natural disaster response agencies and other Earth-observing space agencies around the world. NASA has two different types of satellite systems to help track wildfires: polar orbiters and geostationary platforms. Polar orbiters like NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites and NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite provide detailed views of fires and smoke globally up to twice a day. In contrast, geostationary satellites like GOES (which is operated by NOAA but was designed and built by NASA) orbit Earth in an equatorial plane with a 24-hour period, the same rate at which Earth rotates, and therefore they remain at a fixed longitude above the equator. This enables the geostationary satellites to provide frequent (five-minute) repeat imaging of a portion of the globe; however, they typically have coarser spatial resolution than the polar orbiters, which fly at much lower altitudes (about 435 miles, or 700 kilometers, above Earth's surface). The NASA-operated polar-orbiting satellite instruments that are relevant for fire monitoring and management are described below. In addition, other satellites used for fire forecasting and risk assessment include the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM) and Soil Moisture Active Passive or (SMAP) satellites. Finally, burned area mapping leverages data from Landsat and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite, along with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments. Post-fire assessment of damages to human and natural systems is a key part of understanding the potential for debris flows and landslides, as well as the influence of changing frequency and severity of wildfires. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument flies aboard NASA's Terra satellite. With its spectral bands from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelength region and its high spatial resolution of about 50 to 300 feet (15 to 90 meters), ASTER images Earth to map and monitor the changing surface of our planet. The broad spectral coverage of ASTER provides scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. False-color ASTER composite images are created using visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared wavelengths, each making different features such as smoke, active fires and ground surfaces, stand out. ASTER's U.S. science team is located at JPL. Data from the JPL-built and managed Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on NASA's Aqua spacecraft provide a look at concentrations and global transport of carbon monoxide pollution from fires burning. Various bands of AIRS imagery can be combined to provide a false-color composite image to show carbon monoxide concentrations and temperatures. The highest concentrations of carbon monoxide are shown in yellows and reds in AIRS imagery. AIRS is sensitive to carbon monoxide in the mid-troposphere at heights between 1.2 and 6.2 miles (2 and 10 kilometers), with a peak sensitivity at an altitude of approximately 3.1 miles (5 kilometers). Strong winds at these altitudes are conducive to the long-range transport of pollution lifted by heat from strong fires. The JPL-built and managed Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite also provides unique information on wildfire smoke plume characteristics. MISR's nine cameras, each viewing Earth at a different angle, are used to determine the heights of smoke plumes above the surface in much the same way that our two eyes, pointing in slightly different directions, give us depth perception. Plume height is an important parameter that governs how far the smoke particles travel in the atmosphere; injection of the particles to higher altitudes generally impacts air quality farther away from the source. MISR's multi-angular observing strategy also enables estimation of the concentrations of the airborne smoke particles. Inhalation of these particles increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument, which flies on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite, provides information on smoke plume injection height and the vertical distribution of aerosols through the atmosphere. These lidar data are unique in their ability to detect optically thin smoke layers at a fine vertical resolution, and CALIOP is able to view extensive smoke plumes that do not have clear boundaries. When paired with models, this instrument is able to provide novel information, such as the attribution of a river of smoke to numerous fires and the evolution of smoke-plume injection height over a day, which has implications for climate (black carbon transport and deposition on snow and ice, albedo change), air quality and human health. The MODIS instrument flies aboard two NASA satellites: Terra and Aqua. MODIS provides daytime visible imagery and infrared night-time imagery. In the images, actively burning areas or hot spots, as detected by MODIS's thermal bands, are outlined in red. Each hot spot is an area where the thermal detectors on the MODIS instrument recognized temperatures higher than background. Such hot spots are diagnostic for detecting fire whether or not they are accompanied by plumes of smoke. MODIS imagery can also be false-colored to show the extent of burned areas, the brick red color in false-colored images. The specific focus of the NASA Terra satellite's Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument is on the distribution, transport, sources and sinks of carbon monoxide in the troposphere. Carbon monoxide, which is expelled from factories, cars and forest fires, hinders the atmosphere's natural ability to rid itself of harmful pollutants. NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS has provided daytime and night-time imagery of wildfires. VIIRS is the younger sister of MODIS and provides finer spatial resolution imagery (1,230 feet or 375 meters). Daytime imagery shows both the extent of smoke and heat signatures from the fires burning. Also, the VIIRS \"day/night band\" provides a look at the heat of fires at night. It detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe signals such as city lights, auroras and wildfires. NASA has a fleet of research aircraft carrying the latest sensor technologies that can be used for Earth observations. NASA's ER-2 aircraft, based at Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) in Palmdale, California, flies as high as 70,000 feet (21,300 meters), almost twice as high as a commercial airliner, and is used for science research missions over much of the world.

The CU-Boulder-led research group's experiments at Mauna Loa will provide important clues for understanding how changes in the water cycle influence changes in atmospheric circulation and global temperatures. (UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO) -- Fifty years ago scientists began measuring carbon dioxide continuously from on top of Hawaii's Mauna Loa, the largest volcano in the world. This October CU-Boulder researchers will set up the first real-time experiments there to track Earth's most abundant, and arguably most important heat-trapping gas: water. \"There's no question CO2 is driving changes in our planet's climate, but a lot of the changes we are seeing are due to changes in the water cycle, and to the amount of water vapor in the air,\" said David Noone, a climate scientist with CU-Boulder's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. Noone, along with Assistant Professor Joe Galewsky of the University of New Mexico, are leading the water vapor-tracking project throughout the month of October. In its vapor phase, water, like carbon dioxide, traps and radiates heat back toward our planet. As global temperatures rise, atmospheric humidity also increases, boosting the greenhouse effect. Even though water vapor lasts just a short time in the atmosphere ( a few days), its amplifying effects could more than double the warming caused by CO2 on a global scale, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By helping discover what controls subtropical humidity, the group's experiments at Mauna Loa will provide important clues for understanding how changes in the water cycle influence changes in atmospheric circulation and global temperatures. Noone suspects that if extensive drying occurs over the subtropics, roughly between 20 and 35 degrees north and south, the resulting drop in atmospheric humidity would allow proportionally more radiation to escape into space, moderating how much the planet eventually warms. Which processes in the climate system determine the degree and extent of subtropical drying is still a largely unanswered question and is the motivation behind the water-tracking experiments in Hawaii. From atop Mauna Loa, Noone, CU-Bouder graduate student Derek Brown and Galewsky's team will work to identify the origins of both moist and dry air masses converging on Hawaii by measuring the chemical \"tags\" created by water vapor's isotopes. The research team will use six different measurement techniques to track water vapor in real-time, relying on both field-based air samples and satellite-based remote-sensing observations. They will be in the field Oct. 8 - Nov. 6.

This is the fifth of his dispatches from the negotiations. At Oceans Day in Copenhagen we heard about the acidification of the world’s oceans as they absorb carbon dioxide [CO2], how that becomes less efficient as the ocean temperature rises, and the subsequent effects on marine life of all kinds. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to increased ocean acidity, for example, and several Pacific island and coastal nations raised concerns for their future survival as sea level rises significantly over this century, as it seems likely to do. The Copenhagen ice bear. We also heard from Dr. Martin Sommerkorn of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) about the methane being released into the Arctic Ocean as it warms — methane being a much more potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas than CO2. Concerns were expressed about the expected date for the final disappearance of summer (permanent, all-year-round) sea ice in the Arctic, as a result of warming in the region, and the potential for that becoming a climate change ‘tipping point’. (Tipping points are climatic changes that could kick start abrupt and potentially irreversible changes on the planet.) Meanwhile outside the WWF’s Arctic Tent, where I saw the presentations, stands a sculpture of the the \"Copenhagen ice bear\". It started out as a full-blown ice sculpture of a polar bear (see www.panda.org/arctic), and now does not look nearly as cute, which I think drives home the point that climate change will not be pretty. My overwhelming sense is that people feel powerless with respect to climate change in the ocean, the effects of which are made worse by environmental issues such as overfishing and pollution run-off in coastal areas. The changes in the deep ocean are driven by several things: the increased CO2 in the atmosphere (which causes the sea to become more acidic); the related increase in temperature of the water; and the increased volume of the ocean that increase in temperature causes, along with sea level rise due to melting ice sheets. Some presenters talked about setting up more marine preserves (which are a good idea, similar to national parks), but that would not get to the root of the problem. --Tony Freeman This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

That’s true, but as pointed out at the end of this piece, there’s more to this story than just the strength of the earthquake. Though it’s not making it into the headlines, the condition of the ice in the region was also key. Specifically, the lack of nearby sea ice, coastal ice (also called fast or landfast ice) and pack ice made the portion of the Sulzberger Ice Shelf that broke off particularly susceptible to the incoming waves from the tsunami. Here’s how Kelly Brunt, the Goddard scientist who made the discovery, explained it in her Journal of Glaciology paper: “The recent calving from the Sulzberger Ice Shelf suggests that, while the rifts provide the ice-shelf front with a zone that is weakened with respect to stress, and while tsunamis arrive episodically to cause vibrational disturbances to these rifts, some additional enabling condition must be satisfied before a given tsunami can lead to the detachment of an iceberg.

The mission's primary instrument, Aquarius, will study interactions between ocean circulation, the water cycle and climate by measuring ocean surface salinity. Engineers at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California are performing final tests before mating Aquarius/SAC-D to its Delta II rocket. The mission is a collaboration between NASA and Argentina's space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), with participation from Brazil, Canada, France and Italy. SAC stands for Satelite de Applicaciones Cientificas. Aquarius was built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. In addition to Aquarius, the observatory carries seven other instruments that will collect environmental data for a wide range of applications, including studies of natural hazards, air quality, land processes and epidemiology. The mission will make NASA's first space observations of the concentration of dissolved salt at the ocean surface. Aquarius' observations will reveal how salinity variations influence ocean circulation, trace the path of freshwater around our planet, and help drive Earth's climate. The ocean surface constantly exchanges water and heat with Earth's atmosphere. Approximately 80 percent of the global water cycle that moves freshwater from the ocean to the atmosphere to the land and back to the ocean happens over the ocean. Salinity plays a key role in these exchanges. By tracking changes in ocean surface salinity, Aquarius will monitor variations in the water cycle caused by evaporation and precipitation over the ocean, river runoff, and the freezing and melting of sea ice. Salinity also makes seawater denser, causing it to sink, where it becomes part of deep, interconnected ocean currents. This deep ocean \"conveyor belt\" moves water masses and heat from the tropics to the polar regions, helping to regulate Earth's climate. \"Salinity is the glue that bonds two major components of Earth's complex climate system: ocean circulation and the global water cycle,\" said Aquarius Principal Investigator Gary Lagerloef of Earth & Space Research in Seattle. \"Aquarius will map global variations in salinity in unprecedented detail, leading to new discoveries that will improve our ability to predict future climate.\" Aquarius will measure salinity by sensing microwave emissions from the water's surface with a radiometer instrument. These emissions can be used to indicate the saltiness of the surface water, after accounting for other environmental factors. Salinity levels in the open ocean vary by only about five parts per thousand, and small changes are important. Aquarius uses advanced technologies to detect changes in salinity as small as about two parts per 10,000, equivalent to a pinch (about one-eighth of a teaspoon) of salt in a gallon of water. Aquarius will map the entire open ocean every seven days for at least three years from 408 miles (657 kilometers) above Earth. Its measurements will produce monthly estimates of ocean surface salinity with a spatial resolution of 93 miles (150 kilometers). The data will reveal how salinity changes over time and from one part of the ocean to another. The Aquarius/SAC-D mission continues NASA and CONAE's 17-year partnership. NASA provided launch vehicles and operations for three SAC satellite missions and science instruments for two. JPL will manage Aquarius through its commissioning phase and archive mission data. Goddard will manage Aquarius mission operations and process science data. NASA's Launch Services Program at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida is managing the launch. CONAE is providing the SAC-D spacecraft, an optical camera, a thermal camera in collaboration with Canada, a microwave radiometer,; sensors from various Argentine institutions and the mission operations center there. France and Italy are contributing instruments. For more information about Aquarius/SAC-D, visit: http://www.nasa.gov/aquarius and http://www.conae.gov.ar/eng/principal.html.

    "content": "By Amber Jenkins, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the U.K. Meterological (Met) Office are combining forces — bringing together the expertise of observing Earth from space on the one hand, and the expertise of developing climate and weather models and forecasting on the other. Professor Julia Slingo OBE, Chief Scientist of the U.K. Meteorological Office, recently visited JPL and gave us her perspective on climate change and the state of the climate. It's very important to take a complete view — a holistic view — of what's happening to the planet. - Julia Slingo The most compelling piece of evidence that the public are aware of is the increase in the surface temperature of the planet. And that's certainly very compelling, but I don't think it's enough on its own to make the case. What's really important is to look at all sorts of other aspects of the climate system that are now providing us with an increasingly compelling case that something is happening to our climate and that it is indeed warming. Things like the decline in Arctic sea ice and the warming not just of the surface of the oceans, but down to several hundred meters in depth. There are other more unusual pieces of compelling evidence, such as the fact that the atmosphere above the troposphere — the part where our weather doesn't really exist, which we call the stratosphere — is systematically cooling. It’s very difficult to explain that cooling except from the ways in which we’re altering the carbon dioxide concentrations in our atmosphere, which we believe are leading to the warming that we see. So it’s a whole basket of measures, and it’s very important to take a complete view — a holistic view — of what’s happening to the planet to provide us with the compelling evidence that we need to take action and that something is happening. It’s the increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Those levels have been rising systematically ever since the Industrial Revolution, and, in fact, have risen very rapidly over the last fifty years, so that the levels we now measure in the atmosphere are at least a third higher than they’ve been for at least 800,000 years. But, of course, that’s not enough to prove that it’s human activities that are leading to that rise. We can also tell that a lot of the extra carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is coming from very ancient carbon — it isn’t the result of our current biosphere changing its activity or anything like that. This is ancient carbon that’s being released into the atmosphere — in other words, through burning fossil fuels. The other piece of evidence that really links into this is that if we look at oxygen levels in the atmosphere, they have been declining over the last fifty years. The latest measurements show that quite clearly, and, again, it’s entirely consistent with the combustion [of fossil fuels]. So it’s the burning of ancient carbon that’s leading to the rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and the decline in oxygen. There’s a complete story here, for which there is no other explanation, really, than it is our activities and ways of generating energy that are causing our climate to change. Geoengineering, I believe, is foolhardy. Let’s be clear: we’re already geoengineering our planet, through the way that we’ve changed how we use the land and by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The increase in carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere is a relatively simple forcing on the global climate system — carbon dioxide is a well-mixed, inert, chemically inactive gas — and yet we don’t yet understand all the implications for the future of our climate, not just globally, but regionally and locally too. All of the geoengineering solutions that have been proposed — such as mirrors in space, aerosols in the stratosphere, or playing around with the reflectivity of clouds — involve interfering with the climate system. They would perhaps interfere with the climate system in an even more complex way than carbon dioxide, and the implications for regional climate change would be very profound. Furthermore, many of these proposed solutions are a bit like sticking a plaster [Band Aid] on the problem: as soon as you stop taking those actions, the planet will move very rapidly to the warming trajectory that it ought to have been on because the carbon dioxide is still in the atmosphere, and we will see massively rapid climate change. We’re 90 percent certain that what we’re seeing is manmade. As a physicist, it’s very hard to think of any other explanation. It makes sense scientifically. It makes sense in terms of the fundamental physics of how the climate system works. Yes, there are other things that could come into play, and we may have missed something, but actually the physics is so robust that we are very confident indeed. I think there are several pieces of the climate change puzzle that we need to focus on. First, we need to understand a lot more about the carbon cycle of the planet. How do the oceans and vegetation on land take up and give out carbon? How do the oceans and the land surface currently act as a buffer for the additional carbon that we’re putting into the atmosphere? Because 50 percent of the carbon we put into the atmosphere is currently being taken up by the oceans and the land biosphere, and the indications are that that will become less efficient as we go forward. The oceans are becoming more acidic, and the organisms that live in the oceans are less able to take up carbon. The other really big problem for us is what’s going to happen in the polar regions. We’re already seeing a somewhat more rapid decline of Arctic sea ice than we would expect just from the global temperature rise, and we need to understand that if we lose ice at the poles, then there can be feedbacks within the system. In addition, in the polar regions of northern Canada, northern Asia and Siberia, what’s happening to the permafrost? Massive amounts of carbon are locked up in the permanently frozen ground. Emissions of methane are rising in those areas, and there is a potential for a massive release of additional carbon into the atmosphere. We need to get a tighter hold on these bits of the puzzle because that will influence the rate of global warming in the coming century and the temperature changes we could be looking at by",

    "content": "7 min read By Adam VoilandNASA's Earth Science News Team Although the nation’s air has grown significantly cleaner in recent decades, about 40 percent of Americans — 127 million people — live in counties where pollution levels still regularly exceed national air quality standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency. Most of the areas with the heaviest pollution are in California, but other parts of the country are anything but immune. On the drive down I-95 between Baltimore and Washington D.C., for example, sweltering summer heat and relentless traffic often leave plumes of polluted air stewing over the highway making the area one of the top 20 smoggiest metro areas in the country. Come July, all that health-sapping pollution will have company: a 117-foot P-3B NASA research aircraft flying spirals over six ground stations in Maryland. The aircraft is part of a month-long field campaign designed to improve satellite measurements of air pollution. The name of the experiment — \"Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality,\" or DISCOVER-AQ for short — is a mouthful, but its purpose is simple. “We’re trying to fill the knowledge gap that severely limits our ability to monitor air pollution with satellites,” said James Crawford, the campaign’s principal investigator and a scientist based at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The fundamental challenge for satellites measuring air quality is to distinguish between pollution near the surface and pollution higher in the atmosphere. Measurements from aircraft, in combination with ground-based measurements, offer a key perspective that makes such distinctions easier to make. Twelve to fourteen flights are planned throughout July using two primary planes. The P-3B, a four-engine turboprop that returned recently from a deployment to the Arctic, will carry a suite of nine instruments, while a smaller two-engine UC-12 will carry two instruments. Both aircraft will measure the colorless gas ozone and a mixture of soot and other substances known as particulate matter. Other instruments on the P-3B will measure pollutants that lead to the formation of ozone such as nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde. A third aircraft, a Cessna operated by the University of Maryland, will also participate in the campaign. While the UC-12 will cruise at a high altitude of about 26,000 feet; the P-3B will fly corkscrew patterns over six ground stations in Maryland that will bring the plane from its highest altitude of about 15,500 feet to as low as 1,000 feet from the surface. Sampling will focus on an area extending from Beltsville, Md., in the southwest to the northeastern corner of Maryland in a pattern that follows major traffic corridors, overflies ground measurement sites operated by the Maryland Department of the Environment, and observes conditions over the northern Chesapeake Bay. The two instruments aboard the UC-12 will look down at the surface, much like a satellite instrument might, and measure particles and trace gases. The P-3B, in contrast, will sample the air it flies through, allowing it to take samples from a variety of altitudes. The July flights are the first leg of a broader five-year campaign that will bring the aircraft to Houston and other polluted regions during upcoming years. Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that air pollution causes some two million premature deaths globally per year. Pollutants can spark a whole range of diseases including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and bronchitis. Since many countries, including the United States, have large gaps in ground-based networks of air pollution monitors, experts look toward satellites to provide a global perspective. Satellites have attempted to collect information about the main air pollutants that affect human health for more than a decade, yet they have struggled to achieve accurate measurements of the pollutants in the air near the surface — the air people actually breathe. The problem: Most satellite instruments can't distinguish pollution close to the ground from that high in the atmosphere. In addition, clouds can block the view. And bright land surfaces, such as snow, desert sand, and those found in certain urban areas can mar measurements. “We’re better with some pollutants than others, but broadly speaking we have difficulty distinguishing between pollutants high in a given column of air, which we can see quite well with satellites, and pollutants at the surface,” said Kenneth Pickering, DISCOVER-AQ’s project scientist. As a result, questions remain about the vertical distribution of pollutants. How far up in the atmosphere are morning and evening spikes in pollution associated with rush hour noticeable? How does ozone, which peaks near the surface in afternoon, behave at other altitudes throughout the day? When is the best time of the day for satellites to measure various pollutants? The problem is particularly pronounced for pollutants that are abundant at the surface and higher in the atmosphere. For example, a “code red” air-quality day during the summer might produce very high concentrations of ozone in the bottom few kilometers of the atmosphere, yet generate a change of a mere 1 or 2 percent to a total column of ozone. Studies suggest that discrepancies of as much as 30 to 50 percent exist between estimates of ground nitrogen dioxide inferred from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), an instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite launched in",

Image credit: British Antarctic Survey By Alan Buis, Jet Propulsion Laboratory NASA and British Antarctic Survey scientists have reported the first direct evidence that marked changes to Antarctic sea ice drift caused by changing winds are responsible for observed increases in Antarctic sea ice cover in the past two decades. The results help explain why, unlike the dramatic sea ice losses being reported in the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice cover has increased under the effects of climate change. Research scientists Ron Kwok of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and Paul Holland of the Natural Environment Research Council's British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, United Kingdom, used maps created by JPL from more than five million individual daily ice-motion measurements. The data, captured over a period of 19 years by four U.S. Defense Meteorological satellites, show, for the first time, long-term changes in sea ice drift around Antarctica. Trends in Antarctic sea ice motion over the 19-year study period are shown by the arrows, in meters per second per year. The background colors show the change in northward ice speed, with reds being fastest and blues slowest.

The total Antarctic sea ice cover is increasing slowly, but individual regions are actually experiencing much larger gains and losses that are almost offsetting each other overall. \"We now know that these regional changes are caused by changes in the winds, which, in turn, affect the ice cover through changes in both ice drift and air temperature,\" he continued. \"The changes in ice drift also suggest large changes in the ocean surrounding Antarctica, which is very sensitive to the cold and salty water produced by sea ice growth.\" This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

    "content": "A Sierra Nevada forest in Sequoia National Park, Calif. Forest patterns are correlated to snow depth. Image credit: University of Colorado, Boulder By Alan Buis, Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Noah Molotch, CU-Boulder Mid-elevation forests - those between approximately 6,500 to 8,000 feet (1,981 to 2,438 meters) in elevation - are the most sensitive to rising temperatures and changes in precipitation and snowmelt associated with climate change, finds a new University of Colorado Boulder-led study co-funded by NASA. The study looked at how the greenness of Western U.S. forests is linked to fluctuations in year-to-year snowpack. A research team led by CU-Boulder researcher Ernesto Trujillo used satellite and ground data to identify the threshold where mid-elevation forests that are sustained primarily by moisture transition into higher-elevation forests that are instead sustained primarily by sunlight and temperature. The team used 26 years of continuous data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), a spaceborne sensor flying on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite, to measure forest greenness. Forest observations from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft were critical for evaluating the longer-term AVHRR data. Being able to identify this \"tipping point\" is important because many people live and play in these mid-elevation forests in the Western United States, said co-author Noah Molotch, CU-Boulder assistant professor and also a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. These forests are seeing higher levels of wildfires, beetle outbreaks and tree mortality. The researchers found that these mid-elevation forests show a dramatic sensitivity to snow that fell the previous winter, both in terms of accumulation and subsequent melt. About half of the mid-elevation forest greenness measured by satellites was attributed to the snow accumulations from the previous winter, with the other half due to conditions such as soil depth, soil nutrients, temperature and sunlight. \"The strength of the relationship between forest greenness and snowpack from the previous year was quite surprising to us,\" Molotch said. \"Our results provide the first direct observations of snowpack-forest connections across broad spatial scales,\" said Molotch. \"Finding the tipping point between water-limited forests and energy-limited forests defines for us the region of the greatest sensitivity to climate change - the mid-elevation forests - which is where we should focus future research.\" While this study took place in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, Molotch said it is applicable to other mountain ranges across the Western United States. The implications are important, since climate studies indicate the snowpack in mid-elevation forests in the Western United States and other similar forests around the world has been decreasing in the past 50 years due to regional warming. \"If snowpack declines, forests become more stressed, which can lead to ecological changes that include alterations in the distribution and abundance of plant and animal species, as well as vulnerability to perturbations like fires and beetle kills,\" Molotch said. \"When you put this into the context of recent losses in Colorado and elsewhere in the West to forest fire devastation, then it becomes something we really have to pay attention to,\" Molotch said. \"This tipping-point elevation is very likely to migrate up the mountainsides as the climate warms.\" Molotch said the connections the team observed between water availability and forest response have important implications for current and future NASA missions focused on forest structure, soil moisture and snow. NASA's Terra, Aqua and Suomi spacecraft have sensors that measure components of the water cycle and vegetation that can be used to explore the mechanisms behind the study's results. Among the future NASA missions that can contribute to our understanding of connections between snowpack and ecosystems are the JPL-managed Soil Moisture Active Passive spacecraft and NASA's planned synthetic aperture radar satellite mission. The paper was published earlier this month in Nature Geosciences. The National Science Foundation also provided funding. Other participating institutions included the University of California, Irvine; and the University of California, Merced.

More on this image› By Kristen Walbolt, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory This year, NASA will launch two satellite missions that will increase our understanding of Earth’s frozen reaches. Snow, ice sheets, glaciers, sea ice and permafrost, known as the cryosphere, act as Earth’s thermostat and deep freeze, regulating temperatures by reflecting heat from the Sun and storing most of our fresh water. The next Earth science satellites set to launch are twins! The identical satellites of the GRACE Follow-On mission will build on the legacy of their predecessor GRACE by also tracking the ever-changing movement of water around our planet, including Earth’s frozen regions.GRACE-FO, a partnership between NASA and the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ), will provide critical information about how the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are changing. GRACE-FO, workingtogether, will measure the distance between the two satellites to within 1 micron (much less than the width of a human hair) to determine the mass below. Greenland has been losing about 280 gigatons of ice per year on average, and Antarctica has lost almost 120 gigatons a year with indications that both melt rates are increasing. A single gigaton of water would fill about 400,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools; each gigaton represents a billion tons of water. In September, NASA will launch ICESat-2, which uses a laser instrument to precisely measure the changing elevation of ice around the world, allowing scientists to see whether ice sheets and glaciers are accumulating snow and ice or getting thinner over time. ICESat-2 will also make critical measurements of the thickness of sea ice from space. Its laser instrument sends 10,000 pulses per second to the surface and will measure the photons’ return trip to satellite. The trip from ICESat-2 to Earth and back takes about 3.3 milliseconds. Summertime sea ice in the Arctic Ocean now routinely covers about 40 percent less area than it did in the late",

Credit: NASA By Steve Cole, NASA's Office of Communications It’s a scientific conundrum with huge implications for our future: How will our planet react to the increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? That seemingly simple question is particularly tricky because carbon – an essential building block for life on Earth – does not stay in one place or take only one form. Carbon in its many forms, both from natural and human-caused sources, moves within and among the atmosphere, the ocean and land as our living planet breathes. To track and inventory carbon and unravel the many intricate processes that cause it to morph across the planet is an epic challenge. And that’s where NASA comes in. The agency is a trailblazer in using space-based and airborne sensors to observe and quantify carbon in the atmosphere and throughout the land and ocean, working with many U.S. and international partners. For more than two decades, NASA has used the vantage point of space to tackle the carbon puzzle one piece at a time. The agency has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the tools needed to get the job done, from building and launching spacecraft and developing new instruments and integrated datasets to funding basic research, field work, and computer modeling. And that investment continues today.

Plants draw water from soil into their roots and use it to grow. If there's not enough, the resulting drought may have impacts that spread across local water supplies, regional agriculture and even international food prices. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission was the first satellite system to directly measure global changes in the water stored underground in the world's largest aquifers. GRACE Follow-On, scheduled to launch this month, will continue this important task. \"There really are no remote sensing products that are equivalent to GRACE data in giving a snapshot of conditions in deep aquifers,\" said Brian Wardlow, director of the Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Wardlow is familiar with the value of this information in understanding drought. He worked at the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) in Lincoln when the original GRACE data were first incorporated into experimental products of the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor maps. The maps show soil moisture at three underground levels: the top few inches of soil, the top few feet/one meter of soil (the root zone), and aquifers. The U.S. Drought Monitor maps are one of the nation's most important tools for tracking drought across the United States. They are widely used by decision makers at federal and state levels. For example, the current U.S. Farm Bill designates the Drought Monitor's county-by-county drought rankings as the standard for judging eligibility for some federal disaster assistance programs. Climatologist Brian Fuchs of NDMC, one of the team of scientists who author the drought maps, explained that soil moisture is sparsely measured on the ground. \"Some states have their own [ground] networks, but the data is spotty, and that makes it very difficult to use the products in a national assessment,\" he said. \"GRACE covers the entire country, and it helps us to get an idea of where areas of wetness and dryness are.\" The NDMC also considered GRACE data in producing other NDMC resources such as the Quick Drought Response Index (QuickDRI), a NASA-supported project with multiple institutional partners. QuickDRI is an early warning system for flash droughts -- rapidly developing losses of soil moisture due to heat waves and lack of rain. The onset of a flash drought is hard to detect at ground level, but its impacts on agriculture may be as harsh as those of a seasonal drought. When GRACE launched in",

The spacecraft will deliver science that studies plant water use all over the planet, artificial intelligence, gut health in space, more efficient drug development and the formation of inorganic structures without the influence of Earth's gravity. Take a look at five investigations headed to space on the latest SpaceX resupply: Plants regulate their temperature by releasing water through tiny pores on their leaves. If they have sufficient water they can maintain their temperature, but if water is insufficient their temperatures rise. This temperature rise can be measured with a sensor in space. ECOSTRESS, developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, measures the temperature of plants and uses that information to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. As we travel farther into space, the need for artificial intelligence (AI) within a spacecraft increases. Mobile Companion, a European Space Agency (ESA) investigation, explores the use of AI as a way to mitigate crew stress and workload during long-term spaceflight. Spaceflight has an impact on many bodily systems. Rodent Research-7 takes a look at how the microgravity environment of space affects the community of microoganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, or microbiota. The study also evaluates relationships between system changes, such as sleep-wake cycle disruption, and imbalance of microbial populations, to identify contributing factors and support development of countermeasures to protect astronaut health during long-term missions, as well as to improve the treatment of gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic and sleep disorders on Earth. Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the leading causes of death in developed countries. Angiex Cancer Therapy examines whether microgravity-cultured endothelial cells represent a valid in vitro model to test effects of vascular-targeted agents on normal blood vessels. Results may create a model system for designing safer drugs, targeting the vasculature of cancer tumors and helping pharmaceutical companies design safer vascular-targeted drugs. Chemical Gardens are structures that grow during the interaction of metal salt solutions with silicates, carbonates or other selected anions. Their growth characteristics and attractive final shapes form from a complex interplay between reaction-diffusion processes and self-organization. On Earth, gravity-induced flow due to buoyancy differences between the reactants complicates our understanding of the physics behind these chemical gardens. Conducting this experiment in a microgravity environment ensures diffusion-controlled growth and allows researchers a better assessment of initiation and evolution of these structures.

    "content": "4 min read By Denise Lineberry,NASA's Langley Research Center Each new season brings change. Seasonal change on land is something that we’re familiar with and adjust to regularly. But what happens to billions of plankton in the ocean each season? How do they adjust to changing sunlight patterns and mixing of the water column? And what impact do these tiny critters have on us, so far away on land? To answer those questions and others, NASA’s North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) mission began its fourth and final deployment, making it the first research mission to conduct an integrated study of all four distinct phases of the world’s largest phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic and how it gives rise to small organic particles that leave the ocean and end up in the atmosphere, ultimately influencing clouds and climate. “Most scientists studying the bloom head to sea during its climax in late spring and early summer. We did that, but we also went out during the other seasons to fully capture the minimum and transitions of the bloom.” said NAAMES Deputy Project Scientist Rich Moore. “This thoroughness pays off as our ship-based scientists use these data to fully describe the entirety of the plankton bust/boom cycle,” he said. “No one has done this before, and we're excited about the science findings that are beginning to trickle out now.” NAAMES research challenges traditional ideas about bloom dynamics and species succession. Findings from three deployments have already confirmed a distinct shift in the annual cycle of the phytoplankton bloom and researchers have noted a clear lack of larger-sized plankton during the peak of the bloom. The implication of these findings will be presented in a series of journal publications over the coming year. During previous NAAMES deployments, researchers completed 220 research hours aboard an instrumented C-130 aircraft along specific tracks and maneuvers over the North Atlantic, including fly overs of the Woods Hole Oceanic Institute’s (WHOI) Research Vessel Atlantis, which carries more than 50 researchers and crew members. The ongoing ship deployment is currently collecting observations of ocean biological composition and stocks, aerosol measurements and optical properties of the North Atlantic study area. Satellites such as CALIPSO, a joint NASA and CNES mission, also help to study the ocean and the atmosphere – from the depths of the phytoplankton bloom, to the clouds and atmospheric particles in the sky above. This final NAAMES study researches the “ascending transition” of the bloom, which occurs after the phytoplankton minimum in February. In the March-April phase, the plankton are growing steadily, with their abundance in the water continuing to increase or accumulate toward the maximum of the bloom between May and July. This final NAAMES campaign provides a unique opportunity for researchers aboard Atlantis to do experiments that study growth and decay of the phytoplankton population. “For scientists watching the rates of growth, this is the exciting time, because the accumulation rate is expected to be going through the roof and stay high for the next few months,” Moore said. Rates of phytoplankton accumulation are critical for understanding the ocean conditions that lead to phytoplankton growth and its timing, a key to unlocking the environmental drivers and controls of biological dynamics. Because scientists are also interested in the link between the ocean, atmospheric particles and clouds, they’ve conducted meteorological balloon launches from the ship on a regular basis to capture information relevant to cloud formation processes. By combining global data from NASA satellites with the ship, aircraft, and autonomous assets such as floats, along with laboratory research and balloon data, scientists are able to not only understand the current state of the atmosphere, but also how it is evolving over time. “At this point in the study, we're using the logistical lessons learned from the first three deployments to execute what is needed to fill in the last piece of the science puzzle about what drives the accumulation phase for phytoplankton growth,” Moore said. \"Then the real fun starts,\" he said, referring to the ongoing analyses of the data and publication of findings in scientific journals.

The reality is far different. Water from West Antarctica will end up raising sea levels more in Los Angeles and Miami than in Rio de Janeiro, for example, even though Brazil is thousands of miles closer to Antarctica than the United States. How do we know? Scientists first observed this ocean pattern using data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which ended last October after 15 years of operation. When the NASA/German Research Centre for Geosciences GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Central California this month, it will take up the job of monitoring melting polar ice. That will give scientists a renewed opportunity to understand some of the many processes that lead to different rates of sea level rise on different coastlines. Since runoff from melting ice sheets and glaciers currently accounts for about two-thirds of global sea level rise, understanding these melt-related processes is a critical piece of understanding sea level change at a regional scale. The gravitational pull of an ice sheet attracts seawater from the nearby oceans and causes it to pile up along the coastlines. When the ice sheet melts and loses mass, the gravitational pull is reduced, causing the sea level nearby to fall. At the same time, the additional meltwater in the ocean causes sea level rise -- but it rises farther away from the melt source. The falling sea level near the ice sheet and rising sea level farther away are connected like the rising and falling ends of a seesaw. Since every ice sheet and glacier has a unique location and size, each one creates a different seesawing pattern, as individual as a fingerprint. Scientists had theorized that these fingerprint patterns existed, but only observationally detected them for the first time in September",

Ocean currents and winds form a never-ending feedback loop: winds blow over the ocean's surface, creating currents. At the same time, the hot or cold water in these currents influences the wind's speed. Understanding the relationship between the two phenomena is crucial to understanding Earth's changing climate. Gathering data on this interaction can also help people track oil spills, plan shipping routes and understand ocean productivity in relation to fisheries. NASA has been studying winds for decades using NASA's NSCAT, QuickScat and RapidScat instruments. However, DopplerScatt, developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, provides a new capability to measure both winds and currents simultaneously. Flying aboard a B200 King Air aircraft, DopplerScatt is a spinning radar that \"pings\" the ocean's surface, allowing it to take measurements from multiple directions at once. It's a step up from previous technology, which could simultaneously measure currents from one or two directions at the most, and couldn't measure properties of the sea surface as completely as this new instrument. Like a highway patrol person's speed gun, the DopplerScatt instrument calculates the Doppler effect of a radar signal bouncing off an object. As that object moves closer or farther away, it detects these changes and figures out its speed and trajectory. Those measurements are combined with data from a scatterometer, which detects the reflection of the radar signal from the ocean's surface. The more \"scattering\" the radar observes, the rougher the waves. From the roughness and orientation of the waves, wind speed and direction can be calculated. DopplerScatt is funded and managed by the Earth Science Technology Office at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. The B200 King Air research aircraft used to fly the instrument is managed and operated from NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center located in Edwards, California.

    "content": "5 min read By Maria-José Viñas,NASA’s Earth Science News Team River floods are one of the most common and devastating of Earth’s natural disasters. In the past decade, deluges from rivers have killed thousands of people every year around the world and caused losses on the order of tens of billions of U.S. dollars annually. Climate change, which is projected to increase precipitation in certain areas of the planet, might make river floods in these places more frequent and severe in the coming decades. Now, a new study led by researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, analyzes what it would take for river-observing satellites to become an even more useful tool to mitigate flood damage and improve reservoir management globally in near real-time. “Early flood warning systems traditionally depend on gauge networks that detect floods farther up the river, but gauge data are becoming more and more scarce,\" said George Allen, lead author of the new research and a hydrologist at JPL. “Our study shows that there’s room for satellites to help fill in the gap. But for satellites to inform real-time flood mitigation, they have to provide data to water managers within a sufficiently short lag time.” River floods occur when a channel fills with water beyond the capacity of its banks, normally due to heavy rainfall. The flood travels along the course of the river as a wave, moving downstream faster than the water itself. Several satellite missions have been able to detect floods as sudden changes in the height or width of river waters. Once a flood is observed, it is relatively easy to predict accurately how it will move down the river. This information is extremely useful in early flood warning systems and other real-time river management applications. To study the speed at which floods propagate through the planet’s rivers, Allen and his colleagues ran a simple numerical model of flow waves that used information such as the width, slope, depth and roughness — the amount of friction water experiences when traveling along a river — of rivers worldwide. After analyzing wave speeds through 11 million miles (17.7 million kilometers) of rivers around the planet, the researchers found that flood waves traveling at their maximum speed take a median time of three days to reach the next downstream dam, four days to arrive to the next downstream city and six days to exit the river system entirely. The team compared their model’s results with discharge records from more than 20,000 U.S. Geological Survey gauge stations along around 40,000 miles (64,400 kilometers) of varied river systems in the United States. They found that the model estimated faster wave speeds than the gauge data showed. “That was expected, based on the fact that we’re modeling waves moving at maximum speeds, whereas the gauge data are looking at all types of wave speeds: low speeds, high speeds, everything in between,” Allen said. “In this way, our study estimates a worst-case-scenario of how fast floods can move down rivers.” The scientists then used their wave speed findings to calculate data latency — how quickly satellite data should be downloaded, processed and made available to the public to be useful for flood early warning systems and other real-time flood mitigation strategies, as well as reservoir management. In particular, they focused on future data from NASA’s upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. SWOT, scheduled to launch in",

Image credit: NASA › Full image and caption A new instrument that will provide a unique, space-based measurement of how plants respond to changes in water availability has arrived at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin final preparations for launch to the International Space Station this summer aboard a cargo resupply mission. NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) left NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, on April 6 by ground transport and arrived at Kennedy Space Center on April 9. A few days after it reaches the space station, ECOSTRESS will be robotically installed on the exterior of the station's Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility Unit. ECOSTRESS will give us new insights into plant health by quantifying the temperature of plants from space as never before, measuring regions as small as 230 feet (70 meters) on a side, or about the size of a small farm. It will do this by estimating how much water plants are releasing to cool themselves (i.e., evapotranspiration -- the equivalent of sweating in humans). This will tell us how much water different plants use and need, and how they react to environmental stresses caused by water shortages. ECOSTRESS will estimate how much water moves through and out of plants by tracking how the temperatures of plants change. The data from its minimum one-year mission will be used by ecologists, hydrologists, agriculturalists, meteorologists and other scientists. \"Most satellite measurements of plant surface temperature are made at a particular time of day, often in the mid-morning, when plants are not stressed,\" said Simon Hook, the project's principal investigator at JPL. \"ECOSTRESS takes advantage of the space station's orbit to obtain measurements at different times of day, allowing us to see how plants respond to water stress throughout the day.\" Until now, scientists addressing this question globally have had to estimate how that same-time-of-day snapshot varies over the course of a day. ECOSTRESS promises to eliminate much of this guesswork. ECOSTRESS is expected to provide key insights into how plants link Earth's global carbon and water cycles. ECOSTRESS data will be used in conjunction with other satellite and ground measurements, such as those from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite. By doing this, scientists hope to understand more clearly the total amount of carbon dioxide plants remove from the atmosphere during a typical day. In addition, they hope to better identify which areas on the planet require more or less water for the amount of carbon dioxide they take up. In practical terms, the year of data gleaned from ECOSTRESS will be useful for agricultural water managers. This data should improve our understanding of how certain regions are affected by drought and help agricultural and water management communities better manage water use for agriculture. The high ground spatial resolution of ECOSTRESS data will be useful for research on the effects of drought on agriculture at the field-scale.

Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America (ACT-America) is a five-year NASA look at concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in relation to weather systems in the eastern half of the U.S. The study just began a fourth round of science flights, which may reveal that big spring storms are pushing around quite a bit of carbon dioxide. \"The respiration from the biosphere has been accumulating all winter. Photosynthesis is just starting to get going,\" said ACT-America Principal Investigator Ken Davis of Pennsylvania State University, University Park. \"So we may have the most buildup of carbon dioxide in the northern latitude, lower atmosphere at this time of year. As storms move through, that gets transported from north to south.\" Previous measurements, largely from stationary ground-based tower stations, have hinted at this phenomenon. The ACT-America flights will head straight into the frontal boundaries to see whether those hints speak to greater truths. It will be the first time scientists have flown into spring storms with the specific goal of mapping out carbon transport. Flights are currently employing greenhouse-gas-detecting instruments on a B-200 from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. A C-130 from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, is scheduled to join the campaign soon. Another objective of the spring flights is for researchers to get a better handle on the beginnings of photosynthesis and its effects on carbon transport. Ecosystem models don't handle the transition from winter to summer very well, so during fair-weather flights, Davis and company will zero in on the carbon exchange taking place between Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. \"What's unique is we'll cover large areas, a few hundred kilometers on a side, just for a few days,\" said Davis. \"But that snapshot will help us to evaluate the variety of ecosystem models used to simulate that process.\" Flights are currently based out of Shreveport, Louisiana, and are scheduled to transition to Lincoln, Nebraska, next week. For the final two weeks of flights in May, operations will move to coastal Virginia. In the hunt for methane, coastal wetlands are of particular interest to ACT-America scientists because there's a lot of uncertainty around how much methane they produce. \"We've been looking back at our first summer campaign and we don't see a great deal of evidence for strong methane emissions from the coastal wetlands,\" said Davis, \"so we'd like to go back and check that out in the spring, too.\" Previous ACT-America flight campaigns have taken place during summer, fall and winter. The study is planning an additional summer flight campaign to ensure a comprehensive dataset for that season, which is rich with greenhouse gas activity.

    "content": "5 min read By Joe Atkinson,NASA's Langley Research Center It can happen in a flash — airborne science, that is. Two hundred microseconds, to be exact. With lasers shot from the belly of a King Air B200 aircraft. That’s right, scientists are shooting lasers at atmospheric gases — not to zap them out of existence, but to measure them. That was the point of a series of recent test flights out of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. And what was being tested? The triple-pulse Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar, a first-of-its-kind instrument that measures atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O), two powerful greenhouse gases. \"It is the first time with active remote sensing we'll be measuring CO2 and H2O together simultaneously and independently,\" said Upendra Singh, principal investigator for the lidar and technical fellow for sensors and instrumentation with the NASA Engineering and Safety Center based at Langley. \"We are in the process of analyzing terabytes of data and initial results show we have successfully demonstrated the technique — a unique milestone by itself.\" Lidar, or light detection and ranging, is one type of tool researchers can use to make remote measurements of things such as greenhouse gases or atmospheric aerosols. The innovation that allows this lidar to make simultaneous, independent measurements of CO2 and H2O is the triple-pulse laser. One pulse measures carbon dioxide, another measures water vapor and another makes a reference measurement. The three pulses all happen within 200 microseconds of one another. To provide a little context: A microsecond is one millionth of a second. That means this instrument can spot microscopic molecules of CO2 and H2O in a narrow column of air in less than the blink of an eye. CO2 and H2O both trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. \"We are targeting the two most dominant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" said Tamer Refaat, instrument scientist and data analyst for the IPDA. \"And with that we can address the thermodynamics of the atmosphere — how these molecules interact with energy.\" In the case of CO2, scientists could also use the lidar to study how it cycles into and out of the atmosphere, and what happens as weather systems stir it up and transport it. That the lidar can do the work of two instruments and measure water vapor at the same time is just icing on the cake. Refaat compares it to a really sophisticated camera. \"The camera is our instrument. The flash is our laser,\" he said. \"The scene you are shooting is both carbon dioxide and water vapor.\" The triple-pulse lidar is the product of several years of intense development. An earlier version of the instrument used a double-pulse laser that could only measure CO2. It required researchers to make a single laser fire three pulses at three different, precise wavelengths. It also required complex thermal and structural engineering to make it all work — a daunting task, but one researchers were up for given Langley’s long history developing complex lidar instruments. “It’s very difficult,” said Mulugeta Petros, project manager of the triple-pulse lidar. “We had to push the technology. Basically, that’s what NASA does — it pushes the technology. It was challenging in more than just a technological sense. The team had to make a convincing case the instrument would provide real-world value. “In the beginning,” said Singh, “we thought we could never build it. But NASA’s Earth Science Technology Office, who funded this work, was OK with it because the concept was so unique that, if you could build it, the payoff is quite large.” Ultimately, development of the triple-pulse lidar required coordinated team efforts from Langley's Engineering Directorate and support from the Science Directorate and center management. Singh would like to see a version of this lidar in space one day. Unlike passive remote sensors that rely on solar radiation and thus are limited to daytime operation, the new lidar uses a laser transmitter that could make measurements at any time of day or night. Orbiting passive remote sensors are also unable to make good measurements of CO2 near Earth's poles. An active remote sensor such as the triple-pulse could conceivably make those measurements at higher latitudes. But that's all speculation for now. First, more testing, fine-tuning and field work here on Earth for an instrument that's doing something no other can do. “Given the tremendous potential of an instrument that can provide this unique capability of making two important measurements simultaneously and independently, I am looking forward for the opportunity to validate this instrument through a series of science flights in the coming months,\" said Langley Deputy Director Clayton Turner. \"This could be a very valuable science investigation, especially in the lower atmosphere.” Singh has similarly high hopes for the triple-pulse and talks about it in terms that could easily be mistaken for those of a beaming parent. \"Scientifically, we have an instrument that is one-of-a-kind in the world,\" he said. \"And we are, by the way, very proud of it.\" NASA uses satellite lidar technology to study Earth’s forests, key carbon sinks.

    "title": "Unexpected future boost of methane possible from Arctic permafrost",
    "date": null,
    "content": "6 min read By Ellen Gray,NASA's Earth Science News Team New NASA-funded research has discovered that Arctic permafrost’s expected gradual thawing and the associated release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere may actually be sped up by instances of a relatively little known process called abrupt thawing. Abrupt thawing takes place under a certain type of Arctic lake, known as a thermokarst lake that forms as permafrost thaws. The impact on the climate may mean an influx of permafrost-derived methane into the atmosphere in the mid-21st century, which is not currently accounted for in climate projections. The Arctic landscape stores one of the largest natural reservoirs of organic carbon in the world in its frozen soils. But once thawed, soil microbes in the permafrost can turn that carbon into the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, which then enter into the atmosphere and contribute to climate warming. \"The mechanism of abrupt thaw and thermokarst lake formation matters a lot for the permafrost-carbon feedback this century,\" said first author Katey Walter Anthony at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who led the project that was part of NASA’s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), a ten-year program to understand climate change effects on the Arctic. \"We don’t have to wait 200 or 300 years to get these large releases of permafrost carbon. Within my lifetime, my children’s lifetime, it should be ramping up. It’s already happening but it’s not happening at a really fast rate right now, but within a few decades, it should peak.\" The results were published in Nature Communications. Using a combination of computer models and field measurements, Walter Anthony and an international team of U.S. and German researchers found that abrupt thawing more than doubles previous estimates of permafrost-derived greenhouse warming. They found that the abrupt thaw process increases the release of ancient carbon stored in the soil 125 to 190 percent compared to gradual thawing alone. What's more, they found that in future warming scenarios defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, abrupt thawing was as important under the moderate reduction of emissions scenario as it was under the extreme business-as-usual scenario. This means that even in the scenario where humans reduced their global carbon emissions, large methane releases from abrupt thawing are still likely to occur. Permafrost is ground that is frozen year-round. In the Arctic, ice-rich permafrost soils can be up to 260 feet (80 meters) thick. Due to human-caused warming of the atmosphere from greenhouse gas emissions, a gradual thawing of the permafrost is currently taking place where the upper layer of seasonally thawed soil is gradually getting thicker and reaching deeper into the ground. This process wakes up microbes in the soil that decompose soil organic matter and as a result release carbon dioxide and methane back into the atmosphere. This gradual thaw process is accounted for in climate models and is thought to have minimal effect as thawed ground also stimulates the growth of plants, which counterbalance the carbon released into the atmosphere by consuming it during photosynthesis. However, in the presence of thermokarst lakes, permafrost thaws deeper and more quickly. Thermokarst lakes form when substantial amounts of ice in the deep soil melts to liquid water. Because the same amount of ice takes up more volume than water, the land surface slumps and subsides, creating a small depression that then fills with water from rain, snow melt and ground ice melt. The water in the lakes speeds up the thawing of the frozen soil along their shores and expands the lake size and depth at a much faster pace than gradual thawing. \"Within decades you can get very deep thaw-holes, meters to tens of meters of vertical thaw,\" Walter Anthony said. \"So you’re flash thawing the permafrost under these lakes. And we have very easily measured ancient greenhouse gases coming out.\" These ancient greenhouse gases, produced from microbes chewing through ancient carbon stored in the soil, range from 2,000 to 43,000 years old. Walter Anthony and her colleagues captured methane bubbling out of 72 locations in 11 thermokarst lakes in Alaska and Siberia to measure the amount of gas released from the permafrost below the lakes, as well as used radiocarbon dating on captured samples to determine their age. They compared the emissions from lakes to five locations where gradual thawing occurs. In addition, they used the field measurements to evaluate how well their model simulated the natural field conditions.

    "content": "7 min read By Joe Atkinson,NASA's Langley Research Center Send in the clouds. For the last several years, scientists at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, have been exploring the secrets of clouds to improve weather predictions — everything from daily forecasts to keeping aircraft clear of dangerous conditions. So when a new U.S. weather satellite was launched March 1 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA scientists weren't the only ones feeling good about it. Scientists at Langley were feeling pretty pleased, too. There, the Satellite Cloud and Radiative Property Retrieval System (SatCORPS) team takes cloud imagery from NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES), applies some NASA know-how, and feeds the resulting knowledge and products back to NOAA, sharpening daily weather forecasts. The newest satellite, GOES-S, will provide data SatCORPS will use to make those forecasts even better Clouds are a key player in Earth's weather, reflecting incoming sunlight and trapping heat emanating from the planet’s surface. They provide an important source of fresh water through precipitation and are associated with a variety of conditions hazardous to life and property. “All of these effects depend on the physical properties of clouds, which must be properly diagnosed in order to accurately predict their impacts with weather forecast models,” said NASA Langley researcher Bill Smith, who, along with fellow researchers Louis Nguyen and Kris Bedka, leads SatCORPS. One reason weather models can struggle with predicting clouds and their effects is because clouds are not well sampled by conventional atmospheric observations, which come mostly from ground-based sensors, aircraft and weather balloons — none of which provide comprehensive, timely cloud data throughout the full depth of the atmosphere. Using imagery from GOES and other satellites, though, the algorithms developed by SatCORPS can piece together key information on clouds, such as their altitude, thickness, density and whether they're composed of ice crystals, liquid water, or both. \"Weather modeling is like driving a car; in order to get to where you're going — you need to know where you are now,\" said Bedka. “With SatCORPS, we're helping to come up with the best estimate of atmospheric cloud cover at any given time with satellite observations. The models can start from that correct point, then go forward in time and produce more accurate forecasts.\" The seed for SatCORPS was planted in the mid '90s when researchers were developing methods for satellite cloud analyses to support NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) program and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement climate program. One of the early uses was to support flight planning and operations during NASA and Department of Energy airborne science campaigns. The team also realized real-time satellite cloud information could improve weather forecasting, and has been working with partners — including the NASA Goddard Modeling and Assimilation Office, NOAA modeling teams and aviation weather experts — to transition these data to operational systems ever since. The work started with funding from NASA’s Applied Sciences program. The NASA Langley products from SatCORPS provide unique coverage of cloud information that are used in NOAA operational hourly-updating weather forecast models to help produce cloud ceiling forecasts that are critical for a variety of stakeholders including the aviation community,” said Curtis Alexander, acting chief of the Assimilation Development Branch at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. Additionally, SatCORPS cloud products have improved short-range upper-level wind and moisture forecasts. GOES-S, which will be renamed GOES-17 once it reaches geostationary orbit 22,300 miles (about 35,890 kilometers) above Earth, is the second in a new generation of GOES satellites improving the detection of atmospheric phenomena. It will provide coverage of the western U.S. and Pacific Ocean. GOES-16 provides coverage of the eastern United States and Atlantic Ocean. These new-generation satellite imagers scan Earth more frequently and see features on finer scales with more precision than previous GOES satellites. SatCORPS processes data from these and other weather satellites and uses the products to support a wide range of weather and climate research activities. Recent applications target improved knowledge of hazardous weather, such as severe thunderstorms. A key visual indicator of a severe thunderstorm is an overshooting top — a region of cold, textured cloud that protrudes above a storm cloud. The bulk of a storm cloud stays in the troposphere, the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, but not the overshooting top \"You have air rapidly rising up in a thunderstorm,\" said Bedka, \"and so the air goes up in this core updraft region and can break through the lid at the tropopause, ending up in the lower stratosphere.\" Using an automated pattern recognition process that incorporates GOES imagery, the SatCORPS team can spot overshooting tops and provide thunderstorm detection products to the National Weather Service in near real-time. Those products could offer value in areas without good radar coverage. Developing countries could benefit as well. Along similar lines, SatCORPS is working with the University of Oklahoma to improve the prediction of tornadic storms. Historically, tornadic storms produce strong updraft and storm-top outflow, frequent lightning strikes and fast updraft rotation. By developing an automated method to recognize those characteristics in data from different sources — including radar and GOES satellites — the university and SatCORPS teams have created a product that could improve the detection of tornadic storms and provide earlier advance warning of tornadic storm development. That's just the icing on the … plane? Other experimental SatCORPS capabilities have implications for aviation safety. When an aircraft encounters supercooled liquid water in clouds at below-freezing temperatures, it can be bad news. The water can freeze upon contact with the plane’s wings, a condition known as “icing,” and can lead to control problems. To make matters worse, icing conditions are difficult to detect with existing weather radar systems. SatCORPS has been researching these phenomena for years and has developed algorithms to infer the location, altitude and density of supercooled liquid water. That information has been compared to icing conditions reported by pilots to develop a satellite-based icing threat product. Improved knowledge of the location and potential for icing conditions is a high priority for aviation weather forecasters, air traffic managers and, of course, pilots,\" said Smith. Another type of icing caused by high concentrations of small ice crystals can cause jet engines and airspeed indicators to malfunction. The icing can stick to engine surfaces and cause the engine to surge, stall, flame out or experience other malfunctions. Matching its ability to identify strong updrafts in GOES cloud imagery with data from recent airborne studies that looked at ice crystal icing conditions in clouds, SatCORPS discovered that thunderstorm clouds within 25 miles (about 40 kilometers) of strong updrafts are most likely to have high ice water content. Based on those findings, and utilizing other SatCORPS cloud information, the team has developed a High Ice Water Content probability product. Both of these satellite-based icing products are being provided to the National Weather Service for evaluation in aviation weather forecasting operations. And both will be bolstered by the unprecedented cloud data from GOES-16 and GOES-S. “The benefits of these data in SatCORPS will be more accurate and timely knowledge of clouds and their impacts,” said Bedka, “which will improve forecasts and potentially lead to better protection of life and property.” NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey have been mapping the planets since Apollo.

Last week, the satellite’s instrument began its journey toward space riding a truck from Maryland to Arizona, never exceeding 65 mph (about 105 kph). ICESat-2, or the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, is slated to launch in September to measure the height of Earth’s surface, particularly the changing polar ice. To do that, it uses a laser instrument called the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, or ATLAS, that precisely times how long it takes light particles to bounce off Earth and return to the satellite. ATLAS, which was designed, built and tested at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, arrived in Gilbert, Arizona, at Orbital ATK’s facility on Feb. 23, where it will be joined with the spacecraft structure. To deliver the instrument safely to the spacecraft for assembly and testing, the ATLAS team developed special procedures for packing, transporting and monitoring the sensitive hardware. “There was a lot of care and feeding that went with ATLAS along the road,” said Kathy Strickler, ATLAS integration and test lead. The trip followed a successful series of tests, designed to ensure the ATLAS instrument will function in the harsh environment of space. After the instrument passed those tests, including some in a thermal vacuum chamber, engineers inspected ATLAS to make sure it was clean and in the correct travel configuration. Then, they attached probes to the instrument that would check for vibrations as well as temperature and humidity. “These probes tracked what ATLAS actually sensed when going over road bumps, and what ATLAS felt as far as temperature and humidity,” said Jeffrey Twum, the ATLAS transport lead. The team then wrapped the instrument – about the size of a Smart Car – in two layers of anti-electrostatic discharge film, to prevent any shocks en route. With its protections in place, a crane lifted ATLAS into a transporter container. The team bolted it to a platform supported by a series of wire-rope coils used to soften the ride, and the cover of the transporter was fastened shut, sealing up the cargo. The truck carrying ATLAS left the NASA Goddard campus outside Washington around 3 a.m. on President’s Day – timed to avoid the worst traffic on Washington’s busy Beltway. Planning the drive itself was a challenge, Twum noted. The convoy – a scout car, the transport truck, a trail vehicle and other support cars – can’t drive through state capitals or big cities during rush hour. The convoy can’t drive at night without special approvals. It requires permits for some stretches of roads, and is routed to avoid certain construction zones. The lead car, driving a quarter-mile ahead of the truck, looked out for accidents or debris in the road; anything that could impact the transporter. The trailing SUV helped switch lanes when necessary, and watched out for other drivers. The support vehicle carried quality assurance personnel and technicians, who were keeping an eye on the environment within the truck, monitoring any bumps or jostling, and controlling the air flow through the trailer so no dust particles settle on the ATLAS instrument. They stayed at hotels with big parking lots along the way, taking shifts to monitor the instrument overnight. The 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) trip took four and a half days. The ATLAS instrument is now at Orbital ATK, where engineers will attach it to the spacecraft and conduct additional testing. Then, the complete satellite will be repacked and trucked to its last stop before low-Earth orbit: Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

NASA researchers will analyze and model remote-sensing data from the agency’s fleet of Earth-observing missions and commercial satellites, mapping ecosystems at regional and national scales. Satellite data, with its coverage of broad swaths of terrain, are critical for understanding the impacts of human activity on the environment.

So while NASA’s Earth-observing satellites can detect the proliferation and location of these organisms, the precise implications of their life and death cycles on the climate are still unknown. To answer those questions, this week a large multidisciplinary team of scientists is sailing 200 miles west from Seattle into the northeastern Pacific Ocean with advanced underwater robotics and other instruments on a month-long campaign to investigate the secret lives of these plantlike organisms and the animals that eat them. NASA and the National Science Foundation are funding the Export Processes in the Ocean from Remote Sensing (EXPORTS) oceanographic campaign. With more than 100 scientists and crew from nearly 30 research institutions, EXPORTS is the first coordinated multidisciplinary science campaign of its kind to study the pathways, fates and carbon cycle impacts of microscopic and other plankton using two research vessels, a range of underwater robotic platforms and satellite imagery. The team will work from the research vessels (R/V) Roger Revelle and Sally Ride, operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego. “The continued exploration of the ocean, its ecosystems and their controls on the carbon cycle as observed with advanced technologies by EXPORTS will provide unprecedented views of Earth’s unseen world,” said Paula Bontempi, EXPORTS program scientist at NASA Headquarters, Washington. “The science questions the team is tackling really push the frontier of what NASA can do in both remote and in situ optical ocean research. NASA’s goal is to link the biological and biogeochemical ocean processes to information from planned ocean-observing satellite missions, thus extrapolating the results from this mission to global scales.” The challenge that EXPORTS addresses requires an extremely multidisciplinary team of experts. “I am in awe that we’ve been able to bring together a team of true leaders in their individual fields with the single goal of understanding the interactions among life in the sea and the ocean’s carbon cycle,” said David Siegel, professor of marine science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and EXPORTS science lead. “The team has an unprecedented diversity of expertise, including physicists, ecologists, geochemists, numerical modelers, and genomics, robotics and remote-sensing scientists.” The word “phytoplankton” comes from the Greek for “plant drifters”; phytoplankton harness the Sun’s energy to transform dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean into organic carbon — creating carbohydrates and cellular material for nourishment and reproduction — and their movement is largely dictated by the ocean’s physics, including currents. These organisms are microscopic, mostly single-celled, and multiply exponentially, doubling their number on average every day. Their abundance and high productivity make phytoplankton an ideal food source for small animals called zooplankton, which means “animal drifters” in Greek. “If you have a million phytoplankton and zooplankton eat 500,000 of them, the phytoplankton can quickly bounce back to a million within one day,” said Tatiana Rynearson, an oceanographer from the Graduate School of Oceanography at The University of Rhode Island and a member of the EXPORTS team. “Phytoplankton provide energy for the whole ecosystem because they’re able to replenish their populations rapidly.” Like phytoplankton, zooplankton are diverse in species. Some are single-celled and microscopic (microzooplankton), while others, such as the shrimp-like krill and jellyfish, are plainly visible to the naked eye. Various species live near the ocean’s surface all their lives, while others spend their days in the twilight zone from 200 meters to",

    "content": "5 min read By Esprit Smith,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory A new NASA-led study shows that climate change is likely to intensify extreme weather events known as atmospheric rivers across most of the globe by the end of this century, while slightly reducing their number. The new study projects atmospheric rivers will be significantly longer and wider than the ones we observe today, leading to more frequent atmospheric river conditions in affected areas. \"The results project that in a scenario where greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, there will be about 10 percent fewer atmospheric rivers globally by the end of the 21st century,\" said the study's lead author, Duane Waliser, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"However, because the findings project that the atmospheric rivers will be, on average, about 25 percent wider and longer, the global frequency of atmospheric river conditions -- like heavy rain and strong winds -- will actually increase by about 50 percent.\" The results also show that the frequency of the most intense atmospheric river storms is projected to nearly double. Atmospheric rivers are long, narrow jets of air that carry huge amounts of water vapor from the tropics to Earth's continents and polar regions. These \"rivers in the sky\" typically range from 250 to 375 miles (400 to 600 kilometers) wide and carry as much water -- in the form of water vapor -- as about 25 Mississippi Rivers. When an atmospheric river makes landfall, particularly against mountainous terrain (such as the Sierra Nevada and the Andes), it releases much of that water vapor in the form of rain or snow. These storm systems are common -- on average, there are about 11 present on Earth at any time. In many areas of the globe, they bring much-needed precipitation and are an important contribution to annual freshwater supplies. However, stronger atmospheric rivers -- especially those that stall at landfall or that produce rain on top of snowpack -- can cause disastrous flooding. Atmospheric rivers show up on satellite imagery, including in data from a series of actual atmospheric river storms that drenched the U.S. West Coast and caused severe flooding in early",

The team’s mission for NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) is to study the life and death of the small organisms that play a critical role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and in the ocean’s carbon cycle. More than 100 scientists and crew from more than 20 research institutions will embark from Seattle for NASA’s Export Processes in the Ocean from Remote Sensing (EXPORTS) oceanographic campaign. EXPORTS is the first coordinated multidisciplinary science campaign of its kind to study the fates and carbon cycle impacts of microscopic plankton using two research vessels and several underwater robotic platforms. The research vessels, the R/V Revelle and R/V Sally Ride, operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, will sail west 200 miles into the open ocean. From these seaborne laboratories, researchers will explore the plankton, as well as the chemical and physical properties of the ocean from the surface to half a mile below into the twilight zone, a region with little or no sunlight where the carbon from the plankton can be sequestered, or kept out of the atmosphere, for periods ranging from decades to thousands of years. “By employing two ships we’ll be able to observe complex oceanographic processes that vary both in space and time that we wouldn’t be able to capture with a single ship,” said Paula Bontempi, program manager for Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry at NASA Headquarters. Phytoplankton are tiny, plant-like organisms that live in the sunlit upper ocean. They use sunlight and dissolved carbon dioxide that enters the upper ocean from the atmosphere to grow through photosynthesis, which is one way that ocean organisms cycle carbon. As primary producers, phytoplankton play an important role in removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. When phytoplankton are consumed by plankton or die, their remains sink and some fraction of their carbon is exported to depth. While the major export pathways of how carbon moves through the ocean are known, the magnitude of the carbon flows in the different oceanic pathways and their dependence on ecosystem characteristics are poorly known. Scientists on the EXPORTS team are investigating how much carbon moves through the ocean within the upper sunlit layer and into the twilight zone and how ocean ecological processes affect carbon fate and sequestration. This information is needed to predict how much carbon will cycle back into the atmosphere over what time scales, or how much carbon is exported to ocean depths. “The carbon humans are putting into the atmosphere is warming Earth,” says Mike Sieracki, program director in the National Science Foundation’s Division of Ocean Sciences. “Much of that carbon eventually finds its way into the ocean and is transported to the deep ocean, where it is sequestered and will not return to the atmosphere for a long time. This project will help us understand the biological and chemical processes that remove the carbon, and establish a foundation for monitoring these processes as the climate changes.” Seven years in the making, the",

Scientists will be able to use that temperature data to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to water shortages. Credit: USDA › Larger view Doctors learn a lot about their patients' health by taking their temperature. An elevated temperature, or fever, can be a sign of illness. The same goes for plants, but their temperatures on a global scale are harder to measure than the temperatures of individual people. That's about to change, thanks to a new NASA instrument that soon will be installed on the International Space Station called ECOSTRESS, or ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station. ECOSTRESS will measure the temperature of plants from space. This will enable researchers to determine plant water use and to study how drought conditions affect plant health. Plants draw in water from the soil, and as they are heated by the Sun, the water is released through pores on the plants' leaves through a process called transpiration. This cools the plant down, much as sweating does in humans. However, if there is not enough water available to the plants, they close their pores to conserve water, causing their temperatures to rise. Plants use those same pores to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis - the process they use to turn carbon dioxide and water into the sugar they use as food. If they continue to experience insufficient water availability, or \"water stress,\" they eventually starve or overheat, and die. ECOSTRESS data will show these changes in plants' temperatures, providing insight into their health and water use while there is still time for water managers to correct agricultural water imbalances. \"When a plant is so stressed that it turns brown, it's often too late for it to recover,\" said Simon Hook, ECOSTRESS principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"But measuring the temperature of the plant lets you see that a plant is stressed before it reaches that point.\" These temperature measurements are also considered an early indicator of potential droughts. When plants in a given area start showing signs of water stress through elevated temperature, an agricultural drought is likely underway. Having these data in advance gives the agricultural community a chance to prepare and/or respond accordingly. \"ECOSTRESS will allow us to monitor rapid changes in crop stress at the field level, enabling earlier and more accurate estimates of how yields will be impacted,\" said Martha Anderson, an ECOSTRESS science team member with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland. \"Even short-term moisture stress, if it occurs during a critical stage of crop growth, can significantly impact productivity.\" ECOSTRESS will hitch a ride to the space station on a NASA-contracted, SpaceX cargo resupply mission scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on June 29. Once it arrives, it will be robotically installed on the exterior of the station's Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility Unit. Over the next year, ECOSTRESS will use the space station's unique low Earth orbit to collect data over multiple areas of land at different times of day. The instrument will produce detailed images of areas as small as 43 by 76 yards (40 by 70 meters) -- about the size of a small farm -- every three to five days. Other instruments in space can make measurements with the same level of detail or at different times of day -- but not both. ECOSTRESS' dual capability makes it especially important for scientists trying to better understand our natural ecosystems and others working toward improved food security and water resource management. \"As water resources become more critical for our growing population, we need to track precisely how much water our crops need,\" said ECOSTRESS science lead Josh Fisher of JPL. \"We need to know when plants are becoming susceptible to droughts, and we need to know which parts of the ecosystem are more vulnerable because of water stress.\" Although not part of its primary mission, ECOSTRESS temperature data will also be valuable for other studies that require temperature information, such as detecting and characterizing volcanoes, wildfires and heat waves.

The first of its kind to be taken by one of the agency's newest Earth-observing missions, it is more detailed than previous imagery and, unlike prior imagery, was acquired at different times of the day. ECOSTRESS measures surface temperature -- the temperature you would feel if you touched the surface of something -- rather than the air temperature typically reported by weather stations. The images were acquired throughout the day between July 22 and Aug. 14 during an extended period of high temperatures in the Los Angeles area. Cooler temperatures appear in blue, and warmer temperatures are shown in red. In the image taken July 22 at 4:07 a.m., the hottest (reddest) areas are dark asphalt surfaces that are unshaded during the day and remain warm throughout the night. They include freeways, airports, oil refineries and parking lots. The cool (blue) areas are clouds and higher-elevation mountainous regions (dark blue). The other images show how different urban surfaces warm up and cool down throughout the day. The daytime image (upper left) acquired at 3:01 p.m. PDT on July 31 shows how hot the inland regions can get during a period of extreme heat. The Santa Anita racetrack parking lot was the hottest area. At 147.3° F, the surface temperature there was hot enough to fry an egg. Images in the upper right, lower left and lower right -- acquired at 9:26 p.m., 11:43 p.m. and 4:07 a.m., respectively -- show how urban surfaces cool down, with roof surfaces cooling at a much faster rate than roads and other asphalt surfaces that have a higher heat capacity. Note that in the lower-right image, reds correspond with temperatures in the 80s. The top image from the same time shows a slightly different scale to enhance the contrast between different surfaces -- and reds correspond with temperatures in the 70s. The Los Angeles area is known for its Mediterranean climate and abundant sunshine but also for its extreme \"micro-climate\" temperature swings -- from cooler coastal areas to much warmer inland regions like the San Gabriel Valley. ECOSTRESS can detect the distribution and pattern variations of that surface heat over areas the size of a football field. ECOSTRESS launched on June 29 as part of a SpaceX commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station. The primary mission of ECOSTRESS is to detect plant health by monitoring Earth's surface temperature.

The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, or ICESat-2, will provide critical observations of how ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice are changing, leading to insights into how those changes impact people where they live. Launch is scheduled for Sept. 15, and as we count down the days, we’re counting up 10 things you should know about ICESat-2 There’s only one scientific instrument on ICESat-2, but it is a marvel. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, or ATLAS, measures height by precisely timing how long it takes individual photons of light from a laser to leave the satellite, bounce off Earth, and return to the satellite. Hundreds of people at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, worked to build this smart-car-sized instrument to exacting requirements so that scientists can measure minute changes in our planet’s ice. Not all ice is the same. Land ice, like the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, or glaciers dotting the Himalaya, builds up as snow falls over centuries and forms compacted layers. When it melts, it can flow into the ocean and raise sea level. Sea ice, on the other hand, forms when ocean water freezes. It can last for years, or a single winter. When sea ice disappears, there is no effect on sea level (think of a melting ice cube in your drink), but it can change climate and weather patterns far beyond the poles. ICESat-2 will measure elevation to see how much glaciers, sea ice and ice sheets are rising or falling. NASA’s fleet of satellites collect detailed images of our planet that show the changing extent of features like ice sheets and forests, and with ICESat-2’s data, scientists can add the third dimension – height – to those portraits of Earth. ICESat-2’s orbit will make 1,387 unique ground tracks around Earth in 91 days – and then start the same ground pattern again at the beginning. This allows the mission to measure the same ground tracks four times a year and scientists to see how glaciers and other frozen features change with the seasons – including over winter. The ATLAS instrument will measure ice with a laser that shines at 532 nanometers – a bright green on the visible spectrum. When these laser photons return to the satellite, they pass through a series of filters that block any light that’s not exactly at this wavelength. This helps the instrument from being swamped with all the other shades of sunlight naturally reflected from Earth. While the first ICESat satellite (",

In addition to ash and smoke, fires release carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide is a pollutant that can persist in the atmosphere for about a month and can be transported great distances. New images made with data acquired by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA's Aqua satellite show the high concentrations of carbon monoxide emitted from the fires (in orange/red) between July 29 and August 8. As the time series progresses, carbon monoxide high in the atmosphere is shown drifting east -- with one branch moving southward toward Texas and the other forking to the northeast. From space, AIRS measures carbon monoxide high up in the atmosphere -- where it has little effect on the air we breathe. However, strong winds can carry this pollutant downward to where it can have significant effects on air quality. The time series of images shows just how far the carbon monoxide from California's wildfires has travelled eastward and what areas may be at greater risk of experiencing its effects. Other NASA instruments contribute to the study of carbon monoxide as well, including the Measurement of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT), which looks at carbon monoxide in the lower atmosphere, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) which can detect carbon monoxide (and provide other useful surface data) over large areas of land.

Easily identifiable in satellite imagery, the Above Anvil Cirrus Plume, or AACP, looks like a plume of smoke emanating out from the top of what, in all likelihood, is a serious storm. \"The plume pattern in the imagery instantly tells you without the need for radar or lightning observations or other information that these are the storms you really, really need to look out for,\" said Kris Bedka, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The plumes have been a frequent sight over the U.S. this summer as outbreaks of severe weather have raked across the Midwest, bringing high winds, tornadoes and hail with them. Bedka is studying the AACP phenomenon with colleagues at the University of Oklahoma. Their research is showing that compared to non-plumed storms, plumed storms are significantly more likely to produce high winds, major tornadoes and large hail. In addition, their findings could help weather forecasters provide earlier warnings of severe and tornadic storms not just in the U.S. but around the world. There are also implications for climate. “Plume signatures are not only useful for identifying potentially severe storms, but they also represent transport of ice and water vapor into the stratosphere,\" said Elisa Murillo, a graduate student at the University of Oklahoma who has collaborated extensively with Bedka on AACP research. \"Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, and its presence in the stratosphere has strong impacts on climate.” To understand why the plumes are such good indicators of severe weather, it helps to understand the conditions that generate them. Typical thunderstorms top out at the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere — the lowest part of Earth's atmosphere — and the stratosphere. As storm-producing cumulonimbus clouds hit the tropopause their tops flatten out, giving them an anvil-like appearance. Plumes form when intense updrafts puncture the tropopause and drag cloud tops up into the stratosphere with them. There, racing stratospheric jet-stream winds and powerful updrafts collide. \"You have wind flows exceeding 100 miles an hour at the jet-stream level running into this towering updraft,\" said Bedka. \"So jet-stream winds are forced to go around.\" As the jet-stream air collides with the updraft, it rises slightly and becomes colder, forming a U- or V-shaped area of cold temperatures. The collision between updraft and jet stream also causes a ripple effect and transports cirrus cloud ice downstream to form the plume. Plumes are typically warmer than the underlying anvil cloud because they mix with the air in the stratosphere where temperature warms with height. Over the course of their research, Bedka and his colleagues identified hundreds of plumed storms over the U.S. using highly detailed imagery collected at one-minute intervals by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite System, specifically GOES-14 and GOES-16. They then determined when the plumes first formed, how long they lasted and when they decayed. Next, they linked that satellite data to radar and lightning data from the same storms. They also compared the timing of plume formation to when severe weather actually occurred and when severe weather warnings were issued by the National Weather Service. What they found was significant. \"We found about 400 plume-producing storms across 13 severe weather outbreaks,\" said Bedka, \"and in about 100 of them you had a plume appearing 10 minutes before the first warning, potentially providing additional lead time for saving lives and property.\" In a few storms that lead time stretched out even further to about 30 minutes. The plume-producing storms also generated 14 times more severe weather events per storm than storms without plumes. In addition, 88 percent of EF-2 or greater tornadoes and 86 percent of 2-inch-plus hail reports came from plume-producing storms. \"Identifying this plume feature can be paired with radar observations, routinely available here in the U.S., to improve our warning capabilities,\" said Murillo. \"In many places across the world where radar data are not as accessible, early identification of AACPs can help improve warnings and severe weather preparedness.\" In terms of cost, storms that drop hail — often storms of the plumed variety — are the most significant. According to the National Weather Service, hail did $1.7 billion in damage in the U.S. in",

The Global Fire Weather Database integrates different weather factors influencing the likelihood of vegetation fires starting and spreading. It is based on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, which tracks the dryness of three general fuel classes, and the potential behavior of a fire if it were to start. Each day, FWI values are calculated from global weather data, including satellite rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. The FWI System is the most widely used fire danger rating system in the world, and has been adopted for different boreal, temperate and tropical fire environments. GFWED provides a globally consistent fire weather dataset for fire researchers and managers to apply locally. The Fire Weather Index component is suitable as a general index of fire danger. Globally, shifts in continental-scale fire activity follow seasonal changes in the FWI. Over South America and Africa, regions of high FWI and active agricultural burning shift with the tropical rain belts, seen in the GPM precipitation overlay. Over North America and Eurasia, the FWI will \"activate\" in the spring, and shows how week-to-week surges in fire activity can be driven by high FWI values.

    "content": "4 min read Most scientists who study rivers rely on measures of discharge, the volume of water transported through a given cross-section of a river. Much less studied, though critically important, is a river’s total surface area, particularly for scientists trying to understand how carbon dioxide moves between rivers and the atmosphere. To calculate a river’s area, scientists have to know the length and width throughout the whole course—from the narrow headwater streams to the miles-wide stretches found in estuaries. In some places, it’s easy for hydrologists to visit in person and get accurate measurements of the width. But many rivers, especially those in the Arctic or remote tropical jungles, are difficult or expensive to reach. There is also the problem that the width of many rivers changes depending on the season and weather. “Using Landsat data allowed us to get around—or rather above—these problems,” said George Allen, a geographer at Texas A&M University. Along with colleague Tamlin Pavelsky at the University of North Carolina, Allen developed a global database of river widths for large rivers based on roughly 7,300 satellite images collected over several years. To get the most accurate measurements, all of the Landsat scenes were acquired when the rivers were at mean annual discharge—not too high or low—which the researchers knew thanks to a global network of stream gauges that tracks discharge for all large rivers. In the maps above, the width of a river is depicted by the width of the line. As indicated in the map of the Lena River, most of the area of a river network is comprised of smaller tributaries that feed the main stem. While Allen’s technique measures wide rivers (at least 90 meters across) most accurately, he has also developed a model for estimating the width of the narrower streams. (Click on or download the global map to see an enlarged version in more detail.) There have only been a few other attempts to estimate the widths of all of the world’s rivers, and those efforts relied heavily on modeling and extrapolation rather than actual measurements. Using their Landsat-based technique to tally how much of Earth’s total surface is covered by rivers, Allen and Pavelsky came up with a surprisingly large number: 773,000 square kilometers (300,000 square miles), an area larger than Texas. That represents approximately 0.5 percent of Earth’s ice-free surfaces, nearly double the amount calculated in the best previous estimate. The map below shows which river basins have the most surface area covered by streams and rivers. The Brahmaputra River in India and Bangladesh, the Amazon in Brazil, and the Lena in Russia are among the widest rivers—and the river networks with the largest surface areas. Allen and Pavelsky found more river surface area in the Arctic because the terrain map for the Arctic used in the previous estimate was not entirely accurate. They also found more river area in undeveloped areas and less in highly-developed areas. “We think this is because water diversion—things like dams, irrigation, and levees — reduce the amount of water in river channels in our analysis,” noted Allen. Carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouses gases move naturally from rivers into the atmosphere, particularly in upstream and mountainous stretches where rapids and waterfalls are common. Understanding the contribution is important for climate scientists trying to understand how carbon cycles through the atmosphere. The new dataset has many other uses as well. It has already been used to improve flood models and to more accurately classify surface water bodies between lakes, canals, and rivers. Allen also expects that it will become a core data set for interpreting data from NASA’s upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, which will measure changes in river and lake heights globally.

Erosion in protected marine areas could threaten plant and animal species and cultural heritage sites. Worldwide, the study found that 24 percent of Earth’s sandy beaches are eroding, a coastline distance of almost 50,000 miles. The view from space provided researchers with a more accurate picture of just how much of Earth’s shorelines are beaches. They found that about a third (31 percent) of all ice-free shorelines are sandy or gravelly. Africa has the highest proportion of sandy beaches (66 percent) and Europe has the lowest (22 percent). A team of scientists and engineers from the Netherlands used machine learning to “teach” their classification software to accurately identify sandy beaches from images taken by Landsat satellites from NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey. This allowed them to quickly and automatically examine 30 years of data and determine how many of Earth’s beaches are sandy instead of rocky or icy, and how those sandy beaches are changing with time. In the past, answering these questions required years of expensive, labor-intensive research, and the results of previous attempts to measure Earth’s beaches varied widely. “It only took about two months’ calculation time to generate this data set of annual shorelines between",

ECOSTRESS will measure the temperature of plants from space, enabling researchers to determine how much water plants use and to study how droughts affect plant health. The instrument was launched June 29 from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a SpaceX cargo resupply mission. It rode to orbit in the \"trunk\" of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, which berthed at the station on July 2. On July 5, ground controllers at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston extracted ECOSTRESS from the trunk, robotically transferred it to the station's Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) and installed it. After a few days of testing and start-up activities, ECOSTRESS acquired its first-light image on July 9. \"Often satellite missions require weeks or months to produce data of the quality that we are already getting from ECOSTRESS,\" said the mission's principal investigator, Simon Hook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ECOSTRESS is one of a new class of low-cost, rapid-development NASA science instruments. The ECOSTRESS instrument was launched less than four years after the project was started. The ECOSTRESS team is now checking out the instrument and acquiring preliminary science data, a process expected to take about a month. They have completed an initial calibration of the science data and are now validating the data by comparing them with similar measurements made at ground control sites. When this process is complete, ECOSTRESS will be ready to begin its one-year science mission.

ECOSTRESS' primary mission is to detect plant health by monitoring Earth's surface temperature from the vantage point of the International Space Station. However, it can also detect other heat-related phenomenon -- like heat waves, volcanoes and fires. The new image, acquired on July 28, captures three wildfires -- the Carr and Whaleback fires in California, and the Perry Fire in Nevada. Surface temperatures above 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) are shown in red, highlighting the burning areas along the fire fronts. Zooming in on the Carr and Perry fires shows the heat data in more detail, and also the very distinct smoke plumes the fires are producing. The measurements have a ground resolution of nearly 77 yards by 77 yards (70 meters by 70 meters). The Carr Fire, one of the largest of more than a dozen fires burning in California,started on July 23. As of August 2, the fire had grown to over 121,000 acres. The Whaleback Fire started near Spalding, California on July 27 and spanned nearly 19,000 acres on August 2. The Perry Fire, which started just north of Reno, Nevada on July 27, had engulfed more than 49,000 acres as of August 2. ECOSTRESS launched on June 29 as part of a SpaceX commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station.

In addition to better understanding the overall role of forests in the global carbon cycle, the scientists were also able to distinguish between the contributions of various forest types, confirming that among forests, tropical forests are those responsible for the largest component of global carbon fluctuations – both absorbing more carbon than other forest types, and releasing more carbon into the atmosphere due to deforestation and degradation.

There were 28 major wildfires burning across the state as of Sept. 14. This includes the August Complex Fire, which started on Aug. 17 and has since burned over 471,000 acres, making it the largest fire on record in California. The animation shows three-day averages of carbon monoxide concentrations around 3 miles (5 kilometers) up in the atmosphere between Sept. 6 and Sept. 14. The red and orange areas indicate regions with extremely high carbon monoxide concentrations of greater than 350 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). The more normal, background concentrations of carbon monoxide show up as yellow and green, with amounts between 30 and 50 ppbv. Released by the fires along with smoke and ash, carbon monoxide is a pollutant that can persist in the atmosphere for about a month and can be transported great distances. At the high altitude mapped in these images, the gas has little effect on the air we breathe; however, strong winds can carry it downwards to where it can significantly impact air quality. Carbon monoxide plays a role in both air pollution and climate change. The intense heat from the wildfires lofted the carbon monoxide high into the atmosphere, enabling detection by the AIRS instrument. The jet stream then blew the carbon monoxide plume eastward across the U.S. and over the Atlantic Ocean. AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface.

Only 0.001 percent of Earth's total water is lodged in the top few feet of soil. That tiny percentage, however, affects all living things on land and plays an important role in moving water, carbon and heat between land and atmosphere. 2. Soil moisture can compound water risks. A flood follows a heavy rainfall — but only if the ground cannot soak up the rain. Waterlogged soil makes a region more flood-prone. Going to the opposite extreme, a drought can parch soil to such an extent that plants are unable to grow even after a few rains have fallen. Knowing soil moisture allows hydrologists to make better decisions related to the risk of flooding and drought, such as how much water to retain in reservoirs. 3. Soil moisture controls the on-off switch for carbon dioxide cleanup. The world's vast northern forests remove carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, helping to clean up our emissions from burning fossil fuels. But when the ground freezes, that process switches off. Carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere until the ground thaws in the spring and plants begin growing again. Knowing where and for how long the ground is frozen or thawed is an important part of understanding the role of the northern forests in reducing greenhouse warming. SMAP will map frozen and thawed soils north of 45 degrees north latitude (about the latitude of Minneapolis), around the globe. 4. SMAP is a twofer. The spacecraft's radiometer produces an accurate reading of how much moisture is in the top two inches (five centimeters) of soil, but it has low spatial resolution, that is, one measurement covers a large area. A radar instrument produces an image with higher spatial resolution, but it can't measure soil moisture as accurately as a radiometer. Through sophisticated data processing, SMAP combines observations from the two instruments into a very accurate measurement with high spatial resolution. 5. SMAP has a huge, folding, spinning antenna. At 19 feet 8 inches (6 meters) in diameter, SMAP's rotating mesh antenna dwarfs the size of the instruments and spacecraft and is the largest rotating antenna of its kind that NASA has yet deployed. But the entire dish furls into a cylinder one foot (diameter) by four feet (30 by 120 centimeters) to fit inside the rocket's fairing for launch, and it weighs only 128 pounds (about 58 kilograms).

Credit: NASA/GSFC/METI/ERSDAC/JAROS, and U.S./Japan ASTER Science Team By Teresa White, Jane Lee, and Jessica Merzdorf, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service / NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory / NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center This tool provides information that will help people track droughts or floods, make plans for when to plant crops, and forecast agricultural yields. Farmers, researchers, meteorologists, and others now have access to high-resolution NASA data on soil moisture, thanks to a new tool developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), NASA and George Mason University. The app, Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA), provides access to high-resolution data from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument in an easy-to-use format. Soil moisture data are critical for professionals in the agriculture and natural resources sectors who use soil moisture in tandem with other data to plan crop planting, forecast yields, track droughts or floods, and improve weather forecasts. Crop-CASMA is available for free online at https://cloud.csiss.gmu.edu/Crop-CASMA/. The tool provides more thorough spatial coverage and consistency than other soil moisture measurement methods, said Rajat Bindlish, a research associate in Earth science remote sensing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » “Soil moisture is a very important piece of information for agricultural yield and productivity,” said Bindlish. “This will provide a means of using NASA remote sensing data to guide predictions of moisture conditions and water availability. Information on the field conditions is important for agricultural operations.” Some of Crop-CASMA’s primary users will be USDA NASS researchers and statisticians, who release weekly Crop Progress Reports that currently classify states into moisture categories (very short, short, adequate, surplus) to aid farmers and farm managers. The reports also track crops’ health and growing progress. USDA researchers and statisticians will incorporate the tool into applications from spotting flooded fields to identifying conditions that might prevent planting, said NASS Spatial Analysis Research lead Rick Mueller. “There are also challenges deriving early season crop estimates,” Mueller said. “Early in the growing season before crops emerge, traditional remote sensing methods do not work for identifying planted crop type. Crop-CASMA can help identify areas that could not be planted because of wet, saturated, frozen, excessively dry, or inaccessible fields.” In addition to supporting agricultural operations, it will enable research into sustainability and the impact of extreme weather events, Mueller said. “These satellite-derived vegetation condition indices and soil moisture condition maps show firsthand the ever-changing landscape of U.S. agriculture.” The tool is formatted to be accessible to private users, including farmers, researchers, and students, said Crop-CASMA project leader Zhengwei Yang, a USDA geographer and co-investigator of the High-Resolution Soil Moisture Development Project. This work was supported by NASA Applied Sciences’ Earth Science Division’s Western Water Applications Office (WWAO), part of the Applied Sciences Program, and the NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program. “We created an easy-to-use interface, so you don’t need any technical background to use it,” said Yang. “There’s a tool to select an area and create a map you can save as a PDF, and you can also download data from the web to input into your model.” The SMAP data that are the foundation for Crop-CASMA are from the topsoil and root zone levels, or from the surface to roughly 3 feet (1 meter) underground. Raw SMAP data have a 36-kilometer (roughly 20-mile) spatial resolution, meaning each data “footprint” is about the size of a county. The team also developed a data analysis method to estimate a higher-resolution soil moisture product using SMAP and land surface data, giving users information at 1-kilometer (0.62-mile) resolution. Having the data in finer resolution allows users to more accurately pinpoint areas of high or low moisture, said Yang. “Our current reports are at the state level,” Yang said. “One state may be categorized on average as ‘wet,’ but the whole state might not actually be wet. For instance, one area of a state might be wet, while another might be dry. These new data deliver localized moisture readings – this is what matters to the farmer.” Crop-CASMA was developed in cooperation with the Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS) at George Mason University, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. JPL manages the SMAP mission for NASA, and Goddard produces the SMAP 9-km root zone and 1-kilometer surface soil moisture products. Hosted and maintained by the CSISS, the online tool is operated by NASS’s Research and Development Division. “Having the SMAP soil moisture data going directly to the users at NASS realizes one of the key goals of the mission,” said Simon Yueh, SMAP project scientist at JPL. “A strong collaboration between NASA and USDA has made this possible.” Jane J.

An SUV-size Earth satellite that will be equipped with the largest reflector antenna ever launched by NASA is taking shape in the clean room at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Called NISAR, the joint mission between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has big goals: By tracking subtle changes in Earth’s surface, it will spot warning signs of imminent volcanic eruptions, help to monitor groundwater supplies, track the melt rate of ice sheets tied to sea level rise, and observe shifts in the distribution of vegetation around the world. Monitoring these kinds of changes in the planet’s surface over nearly the entire globe hasn’t been done before with the high resolution in space and time that NISAR will deliver. The spacecraft will use two kinds of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to measure changes in Earth’s surface, hence the name NISAR, which is short for NASA-ISRO SAR.

By Sofie Bates, NASA’s Earth Science News Team A NASA study has confirmed with direct evidence that human activities are changing Earth's energy budget, trapping much more energy from the Sun than is escaping back into space. Earth is on a budget – an energy budget. Our planet is constantly trying to balance the flow of energy in and out of Earth’s system. But human activities are throwing that off balance, causing our planet to warm in response. Radiative energy enters Earth’s system from the sunlight that shines on our planet. Some of this energy reflects off of Earth’s surface or atmosphere back into space. The rest gets absorbed, heats the planet, and is then emitted as thermal radiative energy the same way that black asphalt gets hot and radiates heat on a sunny day. Eventually this energy also heads toward space, but some of it gets re-absorbed by clouds and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The absorbed energy may also be emitted back toward Earth, where it will warm the surface even more. Adding more components that absorb radiation – like greenhouse gases – or removing those that reflect it – like aerosols – throws off Earth’s energy balance and causes more energy to be absorbed by Earth instead of escaping into space. This is called a radiative forcing, and it’s the dominant way human activities are affecting the climate.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Teams are headed out by land, water, and air to collect data that will be used to forecast land gain and loss in the Mississippi River Delta as a result of sea level rise. Around this time last year, scientists and researchers for Delta-X – NASA’s new investigation tasked with studying the Mississippi River Delta – were readying their boats and planes for their first field campaign in coastal Louisiana. For the water-based part of the campaign, several boats were to be deployed to measure the flow of water through river channels and the subsequent transport of sediment across the region. For the airborne component, three planes outfitted with specialized remote sensing instruments were scheduled to fly over specific areas, taking measurements to estimate water and sediment flows and vegetation production. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » Combined, the data were expected to provide key insights into the effect of sea level rise on the delta – specifically, why land is disappearing in some places and expanding in others. As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold around the world, those plans, like so many others, were put on hold – until now. The much-anticipated Delta-X spring field campaign is now underway. “We are very excited to finally do this – to collect the datasets and see what they tell us,” said the project’s principal investigator, Marc Simard of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Simard, like many on the Delta-X team, is coordinating with the field crews remotely – a big change from the original plan, which included sending a robust contingent of scientists, postdoctoral fellows, and students into the delta region of Louisiana. Other modifications to the original plan were also made out of an abundance of caution. “For one thing, the teams collecting data in the field are working in three- to four-person pods,” Simard said. “They travel, work, and live together, and tasks have been coordinated so the pods don’t overlap with each other.” This breaks down to one pod per boat and only essential personnel – pilots and radar operators, but no researchers – on the planes. “Before, we were planning to be on the flights. I was looking forward to watching the data as it was coming in,” said Cathleen Jones, Delta-X deputy principal investigator at JPL. “Now we will get quick looks ahead of time but will need to wait until all the data are sent back from the field to really know what we’re looking at. Even so, we are all very excited for this campaign.” When a large river flows downstream toward the ocean or other body of water, it carries with it small particles of silt, sand, and clay. As it nears the ocean shore, this sediment sinks and accumulates to form a landmass called a delta. The river can also branch off to form smaller sediment-carrying channels of water on the way. For this campaign, researchers are investigating the flow of water and sediment, vegetation growth, and other processes in two primary areas: the Atchafalaya Basin, which has been gaining land through sediment accumulation, and the Terrebonne Basin, which lies adjacent to the Atchafalaya and has been losing land rapidly. Teams from Caltech, Louisiana State University, Florida International University, and other collaborating institutions are tasked with collecting important data by land, water, and air. Some are collecting water samples and other measurements by boat – data that will enable scientists to quantify the amount of sediment flowing through the channels that cut through the delta. Others are collecting vegetation samples to better understand the role plants play in elevating soil levels. And another team will take a closer look at where sediment is being deposited in the wetlands. Separately, crews in three aircraft will fly over designated areas simultaneously to acquire data via specialized remote sensing instruments that will provide a complete landscape-level perspective. One plane, equipped with NASA’s AirSWOT instrument, will measure water-surface elevation and slope in the channels, rivers, and lakes that make up the delta region. This will help scientists estimate the volume of water flowing through channels. A second plane, equipped with the agency’s AVIRIS-NG instrument, will estimate carbon and sediment in the water, supplementing the data being collected by boat and covering a larger area. It will also return data on the types and quantity of plants and vegetation present. NASA’s UAVSAR instrument will be on the third plane and measure changes in water levels within the marshes, which will give researchers a clearer picture of how the wetlands are connected to the open water channels and how water flows within them. Scientists will use the combination of these data to calibrate and validate models that will be used to predict the gain and loss of land in the delta under different scenarios of sea level rise, river flows, and watershed management. Deltas protect inland areas from wind and flooding during storms, they serve as a first line of defense against sea level rise, and they are home to many species of plants and wildlife. The Mississippi River Delta, one of the world’s largest, also helps drive the local and national economies via shipping, commercial fishing, and tourism. But the delta is quickly losing land area: Over the last 80 years, it has shrunk by some 2,000 square miles (5,000 square kilometers) – roughly an area the size of the state of Delaware. Naturally occurring deltas evolve in a delicate balance between land loss from soil compaction and ground sinking – which can be accelerated by the extraction of subterranean water, petroleum, and natural gas – and the buildup of soil from accumulated sediment and plant growth. When deltas don’t accumulate sediment fast enough to offset sea level rise and ground sinking, they essentially drown. “Millions of people live on and live from services provided by coastal deltas like the Mississippi River Delta. But sea level rise is causing many major deltas to lose land or disappear altogether, taking those services with them,” Simard said. “We hope to be able to predict where and why some parts of the region will disappear and others are likely to survive.” Despite the delay, the team had little downtime over the past year. They have been working hard to fine-tune their algorithms and models, to make upgrades to some of their equipment, and to finalize a new set of logistics brought on by the pandemic. “Obviously, one of our priorities is getting the highest quality data, but it has also been ensuring that everyone being sent into the field is comfortable with the plan,” Jones said. “We’ve had very open communication about that, and overall, everyone has done a fantastic job navigating the complicated logistics needed for us to have a safe and successful campaign.” The Delta-X team expects to have the first science results from the campaign later this year. Planning for a second campaign in the fall is also underway. Jane J. Lee / Ian J. O’Neill Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-",

    "content": "8 min read As Earth's climate changes, the International Space Station watches from above, helping to provide unique insights to keep our planet safe. On Earth, we often look toward the sky, longing to know what resides in the rest of the universe. Meanwhile, 250 miles above our planet, the International Space Station is looking back. Above us, multiple Earth-observing instruments are mounted on the exterior of several of the station’s modules, including a limb full of cameras, boxes, and tools that hangs off the edge of the station’s Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). Earth-observing CubeSats regularly deploy from the station’s airlock. Astronauts take photos of the planet from the orbiting lab’s windows. This outpost even conducts Earth science experiments. All of this work provides insight into the climate of our home and how we might prepare for coming changes. “If you don’t have a good understanding of how things might change, you are in a very poor position to be able to handle it when they do,” said William Stefanov, manager of the Exploration Science Office at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Weather reflects the conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere \"behaves\" over decades, hundreds of years, or even geological time spans, Stefanov said. That means the factors influencing our climate must be tracked over long periods. Its more than 20 years in orbit makes the space station a great place to collect this long-term data. The combined information creates a unique data set that helps us inform climate decisions and potentially develop solutions to environmental issues. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » The space station affords a unique planetary perspective with an orbital path passing over 90 percent of Earth’s population. Its approximately 52 degrees of orbital inclination allows astronauts and Earth-observing payloads to see the sun rise and set 16 times each day across the world. “That orbit allows the space station to pass over different spots of Earth at different times of day or night and collect data. It is a fundamentally different data set than most other remote sensing instruments collect on free-flying satellites,” Stefanov said. Mounted on the outside of the orbiting laboratory, international payloads such as ECOSTRESS, GEDI, OCO-3, DESIS, TSIS (also known as TSIS-1), and HISUI individually collect climate-related data. In combination, they provide a unique set of measurements that could push the leading edge of environmental research. “The OCO-3 team wants to understand plants and their role in the carbon cycle,” said OCO-3 Project Scientist Annmarie Eldering of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Southern California. “It turns out our space station neighbor ECOSTRESS is looking at how plants respond to stress. And then there is GEDI, which is looking at how much plant material is on the ground. Scientists who are thinking about plants and their role in the carbon cycle are super excited. We have heard lots of discussion about how we can use all the data together to better understand plants.” The OCO-3 sensor uses sunlight reflections through the atmosphere to measure variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide, observing changes of less than a single part per million. “Most gases like ozone, carbon monoxide, or water vapor double or triple in atmospheric concentration when they are polluted, so it is pretty easy to detect. But for carbon dioxide, it is uniquely difficult to see the changes,” Eldering said. Measuring those small changes could be key to answering long-standing questions about atmospheric carbon dioxide. “Fortunately for us, the plants and ocean absorb about half of human-generated carbon dioxide emissions every year. But there are still mysteries around how they do that, why the amount is different each year, and how absorption is going to happen in the future,” Eldering said. “Our data are meant to help answer those kind of questions.” Carbon storage and removal also has been investigated both inside and outside station. Photobioreactor examined whether microalgae could help close the carbon loop in life support systems, and Kuwait’s Experiment: E. coli C5 studied the effect of microgravity on E. coli bacteria that were modified to consume carbon dioxide as a food source. Images taken by former space station payload HICO even helped develop an algorithm to detect Harmful Algal Blooms. Algae play a major role in the global carbon cycle, and blooms are responsible for much of the ocean’s carbon absorption. With other devices such as SAGE-III tracking ozone, ISS-LIS and ASIM monitoring lightning, and TSIS tracking the total energy flowing into Earth from the Sun, station experiments advance numerous climate records and models. “Climate change presents what is perhaps humankind’s greatest environmental challenge,” said former TSIS principal investigator and University of Colorado Boulder professor Peter Pilewskie. “Monitoring the energy that flows into, within, and out of the system underpins our ability to understand how the climate system works, recognize that it is changing, and identify those mechanisms responsible for climate change.” Station offers a standardized, capable platform to house Earth observation experiments such as TSIS. The size of a football field and equipped with numerous attachment points, plenty of data capacity, and a large power supply (slated to become even larger with the upcoming installation of the iROSA solar panels, the space station can host a wide variety of instruments simultaneously. The availability of these resources made station a great last-minute option for the TSIS team to quickly get their payload into orbit. After some delays, the team was facing potential failure of previous tracking instruments before TSIS could launch. “It started to get pretty dire, because accuracy of the climate record is maintained at its highest possible level when the data record is continuous,” says Pilewskie. “Because of space station, we were able to continue this record.” After researchers learn the basics of creating a payload for the space station, they can apply that knowledge to future station projects. Pilewskie is already working on his next experiment, CLARREO Pathfinder, scheduled to launch in the next few years. “The value that we gained from operating an instrument on station that needed to point very precisely cannot be understated,” says Pilewskie. “We have to do the same thing with CLARREO Pathfinder, so we are using some of the same motors that we use to drive the TSIS instruments.” CLARREO plans to study Earth’s climate by taking measurements of sunlight reflected by Earth and the Moon with five to ten times lower uncertainty than measurements from existing sensors. It is not only sensors monitoring our planet from above. People do as well. The windows of the space station provide an opportunity for astronaut photography and manual collection of climate data. Astronauts have taken more than 4 million images of Earth from space (over 3.5 million from the space station), contributing to one of the longest running records of how Earth has changed over time. Crew Earth Observations currently support a number of urban night lighting studies, glacier and volcano monitoring, and studies of atmospheric processes affected by powerful volcanic eruptions. The images also are used in ecological investigations, including a collaborative project called AMASS, which tracked bird migration routes and the effects of changes occurring along those routes. These images also support disaster relief efforts for events such as hurricanes and wildfires. After receiving notification a natural disaster has occurred, scientists on the ground determine whether the crew will be able to see that area while orbiting overhead. If so, the crew captures and sends imagery back to Earth. The pictures are then georeferenced for use by hazard teams on the ground. Astronaut imagery has been useful for wildfire events, for example, showing responders where the smoke plume is going. Station extends its climate science impact by deploying CubeSats into low-Earth orbit. These shoe box-sized devices, which contain technology demonstrations or test new types of climate science, launch to station along with thousands of pounds of other research investigations and cargo supplies. Astronauts unload and prep them on station and then deploy them out of the station airlock. “A lot of our smaller satellites, CubeSats, are getting rides because of the space station. That has been a great resource for small programs, especially universities or NASA centers trying to get some small projects going. CubeSats might be their first stepping stone to larger things,” says TSIS and NanoRacks-MinXSS principal investigator Tom Woods. “Space station offers a lot of opportunities to get these smaller things into space.” More than 250 CubeSats have been released from station, including many climate centric payloads.

Using data from NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) instrument on the International Space Station, researchers have released one of the most accurate maps ever made from space of the human influence on carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The map shows tiny variations in airborne CO2 from one mile of the giant L.A. Basin to the next. The highest CO2 readings, in yellow on the map, are on the west side of downtown L.A. – a densely populated area with congested freeways and CO2-emitting industries. Yellow indicates atmospheric CO2 elevated by five or more molecules out of every million molecules of air, or five parts per million. That’s equivalent to the amount that global atmospheric CO2 is rising globally on average every two years. The animation shows five adjoining swaths of data the OCO-3 instrument collected over the metropolitan area to create a map of CO2 concentrations that covers about 50 square miles (80 square kilometers). Each pixel is about 1.3 miles (2.2 kilometers); the color indicates how much higher the concentration of CO2 is in that spot than in clean desert air north of the city (measured at NASA’s Armstrong Research Center, upper right). Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » Most of the increasing CO2 in the global atmosphere comes from humans burning fossil fuels for energy, and 70% of that comes from cities. Los Angeles has set goals for cutting its carbon emissions. This type of data can help decisionmakers choose the most effective policies to reach those goals and to measure the effectiveness of new regulations. Data from ground level provides critical local measurements, but satellite data is equally necessary because it covers a wider area and also measures CO2 throughout the entire depth of the atmosphere. The International Space Station, which hosts the OCO-3 instrument, circles Earth between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitudes – about the latitudes of London and Patagonia. Almost all cities on Earth come within its view on average once every three days. The OCO-3 team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California schedules measurements at up to 40 locations a day. Most of these targets are high-CO2-emitting cities. The instrument consists of a telescope and three spectrometers, a kind of instrument that analyzes wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum of sunlight to find the spectral “fingerprint” of carbon dioxide. The telescope swivels rapidly to collect as many adjoining swaths of data as possible over a targeted location within two minutes. OCO-3 usually collects a single swath of data as it orbits, like its predecessor the OCO-2 mission (which is still operating), but it’s designed to create snapshot maps like this one to give researchers a more complete picture of emissions from cities and other areas of interest. The maps were published this week in a paper in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment. Jane J. Lee / Ian J. O’Neill Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. 818-354-",

Credit: Leslie Von Pless Fixing just the worst leaks in the Permian Basin oilfield’s infrastructure could cut methane emissions by 55 tons an hour, according to a study by NASA, University of Arizona, and ASU. About half of the biggest sources of the potent greenhouse gas methane in the Permian Basin oilfield are likely to be malfunctioning oilfield equipment, according to a month-long airborne study by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Arizona, and Arizona State University. Repeatedly measuring the size and persistence of emission sources using sensor-equipped aircraft, researchers found that repairing only the 123 sources that they found leaking most persistently on their flights would reduce methane emissions by 55 tons (50 metric tons) an hour. That’s equivalent to 5.5% of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s estimates of all methane emissions from oil and gas production in the entire United States. The research team measured methane concentrations around “super-emitter” methane sources – those emitting more than 22 pounds (10 kilograms) of methane per hour – in the oilfield, which is located in Texas and New Mexico. They calculated the emission rates by combining observed methane concentrations with reported wind speeds. Using airborne imaging spectrometers that identify methane and other gases by their effects on reflected sunlight, the campaign located a total of 1,756 super-emitters in a 22,000-square-mile (57,000-square-kilometer) section of the immense oilfield. As they resurveyed the area throughout the month, the team recorded emissions each time a plume was visible, whether once or a dozen times. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » “Multiple revisits of these sites are the best way to discriminate between unplanned and planned emissions,” said Daniel Cusworth, a JPL scientist and lead author of an analysis published today in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. Cusworth explained that while some regular operations in an oilfield, such as venting pressure-relief valves, release methane, plumes from these planned operations would probably be visible on only one or two consecutive flights. If an emission plume persists, by far the most likely cause is malfunctioning or broken oil and gas equipment. There’s no other industry in the region that could produce such large plumes, and there are more than 60,000 oil and gas wells as well as compressors, pipelines, and other types of equipment – all of which can potentially leak. For their analysis, Cusworth and colleagues focused on 1,100 sources seen emitting methane plumes on at least three flights. Just 123 of these were classified as most persistent, with plumes visible on 50 to 100% of revisits. These few sources emitted about 29% of all the methane detected from the entire group. The 258 plumes in the next most persistent class produced an additional 23% of detected emissions; the researchers think these sources are leaks or a mixture of leaks and planned operations. They classified the remaining two-thirds of the sources as least persistent and most likely to be the result of planned operations. This last and largest class produced 48% of emissions. Once methane sources have been located and verified on the ground by facility operators, there’s a good chance that leaks can be repaired, said Riley Duren of the University of Arizona, who designed and led the flight campaign. “We’ve done cooperative studies with oil and gas operators in California and the Permian where they independently report that 50% of the sources we’re finding are fixable.” The campaign also recorded surprisingly large variations in the extent of emissions. In one part of the basin, emissions almost doubled over a five-day period and then dropped back almost to the original value over another 10 days. These large, unpredictable variations prove that a single snapshot of methane emissions from any location is inadequate for decision-makers to monitor and regulate emission sources, Duren said. “You need measurements daily or weekly,” he added. “That’s a big argument for using airborne and satellite remote sensing.” The imaging spectrometers used in the study, NASA’s Next-Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and ASU’s Global Airborne Observatory, are able to pinpoint methane sources to within about 15 to 30 feet (5 to 10 meters) while flying at the altitude of a commercial airliner. When methane emission plumes were detected, researchers used a high-resolution camera to relate the plumes to individual pieces of equipment on the ground.

    "content": "9 min read By Alan Buis,NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Among the four rocky planets in our solar system, you could say that Earth’s “magnetic” personality is the envy of her interplanetary neighbors. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Unlike Mercury, Venus, and Mars, Earth is surrounded by an immense magnetic field called the magnetosphere. Generated by powerful, dynamic forces at the center of our world, our magnetosphere shields us from erosion of our atmosphere by the solar wind (charged particles our Sun continually spews at us), erosion and particle radiation from coronal mass ejections (massive clouds of energetic and magnetized solar plasma and radiation), and cosmic rays from deep space. Our magnetosphere plays the role of gatekeeper, repelling this unwanted energy that’s harmful to life on Earth, trapping most of it a safe distance from Earth’s surface in twin doughnut-shaped zones called the Van Allen Belts. But Earth’s magnetosphere isn’t a perfect defense. Solar wind variations can disturb it, leading to “space weather” -- geomagnetic storms that can penetrate our atmosphere, threatening spacecraft and astronauts, disrupting navigation systems and wreaking havoc on power grids. On the positive side, these storms also produce Earth’s spectacular aurora. The solar wind creates temporary cracks in the shield, allowing some energy to penetrate down to Earth’s surface daily. Since these intrusions are brief, however, they don’t cause significant issues. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » Because the forces that generate Earth’s magnetic field are constantly changing, the field itself is also in continual flux, its strength waxing and waning over time. This causes the location of Earth’s magnetic north and south poles to gradually shift and to completely flip locations about every 300,000 years or so. You can learn why magnetic field polarity changes and shifts have no effect on climate on the timescales of human lifetimes and aren’t responsible for Earth’s recent observed warming here. To understand the forces that drive Earth’s magnetic field, it helps to first peel back the four main layers of Earth’s “onion” (the solid Earth): Nearly all of Earth’s geomagnetic field originates in the fluid outer core. Like boiling water on a stove, convective forces (which move heat from one place to another, usually through air or water) constantly churn the molten metals, which also swirl in whirlpools driven by Earth’s rotation. As this roiling mass of metal moves around, it generates electrical currents hundreds of miles wide and flowing at thousands of miles per hour as Earth rotates. This mechanism, which is responsible for maintaining Earth’s magnetic field, is known as the geodynamo. At Earth’s surface, the magnetic field forms two poles (a dipole). The north and south magnetic poles have opposite positive and negative polarities, like a bar magnet. The invisible lines of the magnetic field travel in a closed, continuous loop, flowing into Earth at the north magnetic pole and out at the south magnetic pole. The solar wind compresses the field’s shape on Earth’s Sun-facing side, and stretches it into a long tail on the night-facing side. The study of Earth’s past magnetism is called paleomagnetism. Direct observations of the magnetic field extend back just a few centuries, so scientists rely on indirect evidence. Magnetic minerals in ancient undisturbed volcanic and sedimentary rocks, lake and marine sediments, lava flows and archeological artifacts can reveal the magnetic field’s strength and directions, when magnetic pole reversals occurred, and more. By studying global evidence and data from satellites and geomagnetic observatories and analyzing the magnetic field’s evolution using computer models, scientists can construct a history of how the field has changed over geologic time. Earth’s mid-ocean ridges, where tectonic plates form, provide paleomagnetists with data stretching back about 160 million years. As lava continually erupts from the ridges, it spreads out and cools, and the iron-rich minerals in it align with the geomagnetic field, pointing north. Once the lava cools to about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit (700 degrees Celsius), the strength and direction of the magnetic field at that time become “frozen” into the rock. By sampling and radiometrically dating the rock, this record of the magnetic field can be revealed. Studies of Earth’s magnetic field have revealed much of its history. For example, we know that over the past 200 years, the magnetic field has weakened about 9 percent on a global average. However, paleomagnetic studies show the field is actually about the strongest it’s been in the past 100,000 years, and is twice as intense as its million-year average. We also know there’s a well-known “weak spot” in the magnetosphere that is present year-round. Located over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean, the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where the solar wind penetrates closer to Earth’s surface. It’s created by the combined influences of the geodynamo and the tilt of Earth’s magnetic axis. While charged solar particles and cosmic ray particles within the SAA can fry spacecraft electronics, they don’t affect life on Earth’s surface. We know the positions of Earth’s magnetic poles are continually moving. Since it was first precisely located by British Royal Navy officer and polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross in",

Scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and other international research institutions have created a tropical rainforest vulnerability index. It will detect and evaluate the vulnerability of these diverse ecosystems to two main categories of threats: the warming and drying climate, and the consequences of human land use such as deforestation and fragmentation from encroaching roads, agricultural fields, and logging. The index shows that the world’s three major rainforest areas have different degrees of susceptibility to these threats. The Amazon Basin in South America is extremely vulnerable to both climate change and changes in human land use. The Congo Basin in Africa is undergoing the same warming and drying trends as the Amazon but is more resilient. Most Asian rainforests appear to be suffering more from changes in land use than from the changing climate. “Rainforests are perhaps the most endangered habitat on Earth – the canary in the climate-change coal mine,” said Sassan Saatchi, a JPL scientist and lead author of the new study published July 23 in the journal OneEarth. These diverse ecosystems are home to more than half of the planet’s life forms and contain more than half of all the carbon in land vegetation.

Credit: NASA/Steve Wofsy By Alison Gold, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center One way that scientists monitor climate change is through the measure of sea ice extent. Sea ice extent is the area of ice that covers the Arctic Ocean at a given time. Sea ice plays an important role in reflecting sunlight back into space, regulating ocean and air temperature, circulating ocean water, and maintaining animal habitats. NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, use satellites to observe sea ice extent. Over the past several decades, Arctic sea ice extent has been steeply declining year-round, especially in late summer when it reaches its minimum for the year. Sea ice forms in the cold winter months, when seawater freezes into massive blocks of floating ice, then partially melts away in the warm summer months. This cycle repeats every year. Here are five facts to help you better understand Arctic sea ice. NASA has tracked sea ice minimum (usually in September) and maximum (usually in March) extents since",

This week, NASA’s airborne Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission begins its final survey of glaciers that flow from Greenland into the ocean. OMG is completing a six-year mission that is helping to answer how fast sea level is going to rise in the next five, 10, or 50 years. Greenland’s melting glaciers currently contribute more fresh water to sea level rise than any other source does. The glaciers are melting six or seven times faster today than they were only 25 years ago, and OMG is the first NASA mission to focus solely on what the ocean contributes to this ice loss. That’s a critical part of helping improve calculations of future melt rates so that coastal communities worldwide can take timely precautions to limit the damage from higher seas. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » Ice melts faster in warmer water than it does in colder water, but before the OMG mission, the temperature of the ocean water touching Greenland’s more than 200 coastal glaciers was largely unknown. Simply measuring the temperature at the ocean surface isn’t enough. The upper layer of the ocean around Greenland consists largely of Arctic meltwater, and it’s very cold – sometimes even below freezing temperature. About 600 or 700 feet (200 meters) down is a layer of warmer, saltier water carried northward from less-frigid latitudes. Many glacier fronts extend down into the warmer-water zone, where they melt more rapidly. No satellite instrument can peer deep into the ocean to measure temperature. The only way scientists have found to do that is to drop a probe into the water and let it sink. That’s what the OMG team has been doing every summer since",

    "content": "Credit: NASA By Sofie Bates, NASA's Earth Science News Team Climate change is making droughts more frequent, severe, and pervasive. NASA satellites provide data about water availability to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which helps farmers prepare for drought, determining where and what to feed their livestock. As Tracy Schohr goes about her day, water is always on her mind. She’s thinking of it as she rides an all-terrain vehicle around the pasture, looks up hay prices and weather forecasts, and collects data on grazing and invasive weeds for a scientific study. Schohr is a rancher and farmer in Gridley, California, where her family has raised beef cattle and grown rice for six generations. She also aids in scientific research to study drought and other agricultural issues with the University of California Cooperative Extension. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » Drought—a year with a below-average water supply—is a natural part of the climate cycle, but as Earth’s atmosphere continues to warm due to climate change, droughts are becoming more frequent, severe, and pervasive. The past 20 years have been some of the driest conditions in the American west on record. Right now, the western United States—including the part of California home to Schohr’s ranch—is experiencing extreme or exceptional drought that will likely have long-term impacts on the land and the people who depend on it. This year not enough precipitation, also known as a meteorological drought, threatened to kill the grass on Schohr’s ranch. Keeping vegetation alive is one of the main parts of her job. “We’re cattle producers, but we’re really grass farmers,” she remarked in June. “If you mismanage your grass then your cattle won’t survive.” “NASA is well-positioned to assess droughts because we have Earth-observing satellites that provide frequent observations,” said John Bolten, associate program manager of water resources for the NASA Applied Sciences Program. We’re not just interested in our backyard; we’re interested in what’s happening regionally and globally.” Drought is a complicated problem that requires innovative research and lots of data. From the vantage point of space, Earth-observing satellites from NASA and its partners collect data on various signs of drought, such as lack of precipitation (GPM) and snowpack (Landsat, Terra and Aqua), low water levels in reservoirs and streams (Jason-3) or dry soils (SMAP) and depleted groundwater (GRACE-FO). Then scientists at NASA and other institutions use this data to see historical trends, understand the current state of drought, and make projections for the future. NASA’s upcoming Earth System Observatory, together with other planned NASA missions that are part of NASA’s “program of record” will continue many these observations in the future to provide key information that will guide decision-makers confronting challenges posed by climate change, such as drought. Much of this data is incorporated into drought maps and global groundwater maps produced and distributed by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “What we’re able to do is bring in all of this data and use the best attributes of those tools,” said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center. Frequent satellite observations allow Fuchs and his colleagues to track rapidly changing drought conditions. The satellites’ view from space also provides routine, country-wide and world-wide snapshots of drought that can be accessed by local water managers. “We’re not experts in every part of the country, but we have people on the ground who know their backyards better than we do,” said Fuchs. Schohr is one of those people. She uses the U.S. Drought Monitor maps, which provide a weekly assessment of drought conditions, to check the state of drought around the country and look at trends to help her make better decisions for the future. She is also one of the many ranchers across the country who sends updates and photos to the scientists at Drought Monitor to help refine their maps. “That boots on the ground validation really helps us get a good local perspective on what the challenges are,” said Fuchs. Every year in early November, Schohr and her family load their cows into cattle trailers and drive them to annual grasslands about 35 miles away. While there, the herd rotates through several pastures, searching for grass and water. This protects the land from overgrazing, ensuring that the cows have enough to eat and that healthy grasses will regrow in time for the next. “We have to have grass to grow grass,” Schohr explains. “And what’s best for the land is also what’s best for our cattle operation.” With little rain last fall, the Schohrs opted to keep the cattle at their home ranch where the family could easily check on them. Schohr brought hay out to the pasture and checked the water levels in the naturally occurring streams and ponds every few days. She also gave the cows tubs of nutritional supplements, which she says is like a combination multivitamin and protein shake that’s sweetened with molasses. The Schohrs eventually moved their herd to the annual grasslands in mid-December. The cattle grazed in several pastures last winter, including a purple needle grass restoration site that is part of a research project to restore native species. The cows munch on invasive and non-native grasses, weeding out the competition for the native California purple needle grass that will grow in the spring. As the cows mow down grass, Schohr is also checking that they have access to enough water. Cows need to drink between eight and 15 gallons of water per day. The annual grasslands don’t have much natural drinking water—especially this year, as reservoirs are depleted and streamflow is abnormally low, conditions signifying a hydrological drought, which California is currently experiencing. In winter, Schohr relies on solar-powered wells to keep her cattle hydrated. In the spring, she moves the cows to a pasture with seasonal ponds that are home to many California plant species and provide the cows with natural drinking water. Later in the season, the cows move to a field filled with oak trees. The trees provide shade to keep the cattle cool as spring turns to summer, and the cattle mow down the grass so there’s less kindling in the form of dry grass come fire season. The herd will usually stay on these annual grasslands until mid-June, but this year Schohr brought the cattle home in mid-May. California was not only dealing with low reservoirs and streams, but also low soil moisture, called agricultural drought, that causes plants—including that all important grass—to die. As green vegetation started to turn into swaths of brown, Schohr irrigated the pasture on her home ranch on April 1 to keep the grass alive so that the cows would have food to eat when they returned. However, the natural food supply will only last so long. The current outlook suggests California will be in a severe drought at least through the fall, so Schohr is selling calves and stocking her barn with hay, corn and soybean stock in preparation. The challenges of drought that Schohr faces today are the same ones her grandfather dealt with. However, she says it’s easier to make better decisions and prepare for the future with the scientific data that’s available from sources like the U.S. Drought Monitor. “We know the world we’re working in, whereas before—for my grandpa—he just knew the community he worked in,” Schohr said. The Schohr family had to make a lot of tough decisions during the",

Researchers use satellite data and computer modeling to monitor and mitigate these impacts. The Earth is heating up. The effects of human-caused global climate change are becoming more and more apparent as we see more record-breaking heat waves, intense droughts, shifts in rainfall patterns and a rise in average temperatures. And these environmental changes touch every part of crop production. NASA, along with partner agencies and organizations, monitors all of these environmental changes happening today. In addition, NASA uses advanced computer models that pull in satellite data and then simulate how Earth’s climate will respond to continued greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Researchers do this for a range of future scenarios – and then they use the resulting climate projections to see how climate change will affect global agriculture. Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » “When we look at future climate change, it's not the same as the current hot years that we experience,” said Alex Ruane, co-Director of the Climate Impacts Group at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City. He coordinates and leads the climate team for the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), an international project connecting climate science, crop modeling and economic modeling to look at the potential future of crop yields and food security. “If we were to find a location and look at a hot year that was recently experienced, it would likely have been a heat wave that would have raised the overall temperature,” Ruane said. “Climate change is different. Climate change is every day, a little bit more and more. When those heat waves come [in the future], they're just a little bit more intense or extreme, and that has a different physiological impact [on plants].” Those physiological changes on plants can be complex and are tied to crop type and the climate effects seen at the regional and local level. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas responsible for the increase in Earth’s global temperature. Emitted from the burning of fossil fuels, it can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, which means that every year we are adding carbon dioxide to the amount that has accumulated since the start of the Industrial Revolution over 200 years ago. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by plants during photosynthesis, (though not in quantities sufficient enough to remove everything humans emit.) In fact, greenhouse and field experiments have shown that higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can act as a fertilizer and increase plant growth. The amount of benefit a crop receives depends on its type. Wheat, barley and rice for example benefit more from higher carbon dioxide concentrations than corn. More carbon dioxide in the air makes the plant more efficient at absorbing the gas, and consequently it loses less water during the process, which is better for the plant’s growth. With sufficient water and other nutrients, crop yields can increase significantly. However, those higher yields often come with drawbacks for nutrition. “Crops grow faster and bigger under higher CO2,” said Jonas Jägermeyr, the coordinator for the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison project under AgMIP at GISS. “But the protein and micronutrient content is proportionally lower.” Quantity versus quality is one complication when looking at climate effects on crops. Another is that while higher carbon dioxide levels bring some benefits, they also bring the heat. Increases in regional temperatures due to climate change, especially in the tropics, can lead to heat stress for all types of crops. Many crops start feeling stressed at temperatures above about 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (32 to 35 degrees Celsius), said Jägermeyr, although this will vary by crop type and depend on water availability. Heat stress’s most visible sign is wilting from water loss, and can lead to permanent damage to the plant. Different regions will experience different heat intensities in the future climate, especially during extreme events like heat waves. “The pattern of where crops are grown decides the pattern of impacts,” Jägermeyr said. “The more you grow in the tropics, the harder you will be hit. Because it's already pretty warm, an additional amount of warming will be more severe than at high latitudes.” A",

Seen here, almost-empty highways in Colombia during the pandemic. Earth’s atmosphere reacted in surprising ways to the lowering of emissions during the pandemic, showing how closely climate warming and air pollution are linked. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting limitations on travel and other economic sectors by countries around the globe drastically decreased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions within just a few weeks.

New research shows that improved air quality caused by reducing emissions from burning fossil fuels and other sources would improve human health and prevent economic losses. That's according to projections by scientists at NASA, Duke University and Columbia University. When burned, fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. The World Health Organization projects that heat exposure caused by increased temperatures will be the largest health impact of climate change. Simultaneously, burning fossil fuels emit air pollutants, such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides linked to premature death and respiratory illnesses, including asthma. One of these pollutants, nitrogen dioxide, in turn produces ozone pollution harmful for human health. “Emission reductions help us in the long term to avoid disastrous climate change,” said Duke University climate scientist Drew Shindell, who led the research. “But the benefits that we can quantify for health, agriculture, wellbeing, medical expenses, labor and the economy are overwhelmingly driven by clean air in the near term.” Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter » The research shows reducing global emissions over the next 50 years to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement to keep global warming under 2°C through the end of the century would prevent about 4.5 million premature deaths, 1.4 million hospitalizations and emergency room visits, 300 million lost workdays, 1.7 million incidences of dementia, and 440 million tons of crop losses in the United States. Roughly two-thirds of those benefits would be realized even if only the United States reduced emissions. “What we found was that there was a real difference across time, that you have to spend a lot of money now to deal with climate change and transition your economy to renewable energy, and your cars to electric vehicles, electrify all appliances, all of these kinds of things,” Shindell said. “That saves you money in the long run, but in the near term, it doesn't really give you benefits from reduced climate change that outweigh the cost, because climate is slow, it just doesn't respond that quickly.\" The effects of improved air quality, however, occur at a faster pace. Shindell’s team analyzed how emissions might affect public health in different U.S. states, focusing on scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5°C.

Through a new prize competition, NASA is engaging minority serving institutions (MSIs) to bring ideas for new information technologies that will help address climate change. The prize competition, the MSI Space Accelerator, comes from a new partnership between NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, the Minority University Research Education Project within the Office of STEM Engagement, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, and Starburst Accelerator in Los Angeles. The MSI Space Accelerator competition is designed to engage underrepresented academic institutions and help NASA make significant advancements in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the development of autonomous systems. The best ideas will be awarded up to $50,000 in prize funding to each institution. “As we aim for the cosmos, preparing to return to the Moon with the first woman and first person of color, we are exploring every potential and untapped talent right here on planet Earth,” said Shahra Lambert, senior advisor for engagement and equity at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “NASA is committed to help address climate change and this competition will join our two most precious resources, Earth and our youth, to work hand in hand to create a more sustainable planet for generations to come.” This prize challenge follows similar competitions recently sponsored by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate that foster innovation and encourage cost efficient ways to develop new technologies. The current competition will also include mentoring from autonomous systems experts at JPL, and will feature business accelerator services from Starburst to help align the ideas with NASA goals, provide the competing teams with business acumen, and expose them to venture opportunities and potential customers outside of NASA. For this pilot challenge, the technical focus is to create systems that operate without human oversight for future science missions. NASA invites participation from minority serving institutions that can offer capabilities in the design and/or demonstration of tools that can perform effective monitoring of such autonomous systems to diagnose problems, and optimize, reconfigure, and recover from failure. These systems should learn and adapt to improve their behavior over time, including acquiring, modifying, and transforming their activities by augmenting their knowledge on how to perform tasks more effectively and efficiently. The prize competition will be conducted in two rounds. In round one, institutions will submit research papers – due on March 16,",

As the planet warms, permafrost is thawing at an increasing rate, and scientists face a host of uncertainties when trying to determine the potential effects of the thaw. A paper published earlier this year in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment looked at the current state of permafrost research. Along with highlighting conclusions about permafrost thaw, the paper focuses on how researchers are seeking to address the questions surrounding it. Infrastructure is already affected: Thawing permafrost has led to giant sinkholes, slumping telephone poles, damaged roads and runways, and toppled trees. More difficult to see is what has been trapped in permafrost’s mix of soil, ice, and dead organic matter. Research has looked at how chemicals like DDT and microbes – some of which have been frozen for thousands, if not millions, of years – could be released from thawing permafrost.

The NASA Disasters program area team joined the state’s annual hurricane exercise to learn which NASA resources could be most useful during a hurricane or tropical storm event – when every second counts. Resources like NASA’s Short-term Prediction Research and Transition Center (SPoRT) provide crucial data on the ocean environment surrounding a storm, which can provide insights into how strong a storm might get. And following landfall, optical data collected by NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites can map the extent and severity of flooding. “To prepare for the increase in frequency and intensity of weather-related events, we can assist North Carolina communities by obtaining and utilizing all available data and technology. Pre- and post-storm satellite imaging from NASA can help with long-term planning and mitigation, and also with damage assessment right after an event,” said Gary Thompson, deputy risk management chief for North Carolina Emergency Management.

    "content": "10 Interesting Things About Air Air is all around us, but we can’t see it. So what is air, exactly? It’s a mixture of different gases. The air in Earth’s atmosphere is made up of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen. Air also has small amounts of lots of other gases, too, such as carbon dioxide, neon, and hydrogen. While air is mostly gas, it also holds lots of tiny particles. These particles in the air are called aerosols. Some aerosols—like dust and pollen—are picked up naturally when the wind blows. But the air can also carry soot, smoke, and other particles from car exhaust and power plants. These are major contributors to air pollution. People need to breathe, and so do lots of other animals—and plants! Breathing is part of a process called respiration. During respiration, a living thing takes in oxygen from the air and gives out carbon dioxide. This process gives animals and plants the energy to eat, grow, and live life! When humans and animals breathe, we give off an odorless gas called carbon dioxide, or CO2. Plants use this gas, along with sunlight, to make food—and oxygen too! This process is called photosynthesis. However, large amounts of CO2 are produced when cars and power plants burn coal, oil, and gasoline. This is bad because CO2 is the most important contributor to human-caused global warming. When it’s a hot, muggy summer day, you’ve probably heard the word “humid.” But what does that mean, exactly? Relative humidity is the amount of water that the air can hold before it rains. Humidity is usually measured in percentages, so the highest level of relative humidity—right before it rains—is 100 percent. Air seems light, but there is a lot of it pushing down on Earth’s surface. This is called air pressure. You experience high air pressure at sea level because the whole atmosphere is pushing down on you. The air pressure is low on top of a mountain because there is less atmosphere pushing down on you. That difference in air pressure can cause your ears to pop when you’re taking off in an airplane or driving up a hill. On Earth, we’re pretty lucky to have an atmosphere filled with air. The air in our atmosphere acts as insulation, keeping the Earth from getting too cold or too hot. Ozone, another type of gas in the air, also protects us from too much sunlight. Air in the atmosphere can also protect us from meteoroids. When meteoroids contact our atmosphere, they rub against the air and oftentimes are burned into small pieces before reaching Earth. Lots of living things make their homes in soil and water. But did you know that living organisms can also be found hanging out in the air? These tiny microbial organisms are called bioaerosols. Although these microbes can’t fly, they can travel long distances through the air—via wind, rain, or even a sneeze! Even on a very still day, the air around us is always moving. But when a big wind comes, that air can really go! The fastest gust of wind ever recorded on Earth was 253 miles per hour. And as the wind picks up seeds and dust and other particles, it can carry them miles away from their original home! Air pollution is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI. The lower the AQI, the cleaner the air is. However, if you are outside when the AQI is over 100, it’s about the same as breathing in exhaust from a car all day! Things that cause poor air quality are forest fires and cities with lots of car traffic. If the AQI is higher than 100 you shouldn’t spend too much time outside.

Some document the effects of urbanization and man’s impact on the land, while others the ravage of disasters such as fires and floods. Seeing our planet from space gives us a global view that we can’t get elsewhere. Through those eyes, we’ve witnessed damage caused by the recent tsunami in Japan, glacier melt in the Himalayas, the greening of China, the growth of Las Vegas and a century of global warming.

Credit: NASA By Joe Atkinson, NASA's Langley Research Center Inspired by how ants walk around their colonies, a NASA scientist is adding a new dimension to a satellite instrument that measures the height of Earth's ice sheets and sea ice. A NASA scientist is adding a new dimension to the climate-observing powers of a satellite instrument whose main mission is to measure the height of Earth's ice sheets and sea ice. And the inspiration for this new method comes from how ants walk around their colonies. Using a concept adapted from the mathematics and biology communities, Yongxiang Hu of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, developed a method to directly measure snow depth using lidar measurements from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). Lidar uses pulses of laser light to make measurements, similar to how sonar uses sound. Hu worked with other scientists at NASA, the University of Arizona, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Ball Aerospace. Snow depth is an important measurement in understanding climate, weather, and Earth's water cycle, but there are limits to current measurement methods. To determine how to use ICESat-2's laser to directly measure snow depth, Hu turned to a principle he adapted from biologists and physicists who figured out the average length of the path an ant travels inside its colony before coming back out. What those scientists came up with is that the average time an ant walks around inside the colony before coming back is roughly four times the volume of the colony divided by its surface area. Similar to an ant disappearing into a colony and walking around randomly, a photon of light from a lidar enters the snow and bounces around as it is scattered by the snow particles until it exits and is collected by the telescope on ICESat-2. All this happens very fast — at the speed of light. Using a special model simulation and an equation almost identical to the one from the ant problem, Hu discovered he could measure the average distance a photon traveled inside the snow before it’s eventually measured by the lidar and determined the snow depth is half of that average distance. \"The model suggests that the photon is traveling inside the snow almost exactly the way the ant travels inside its colony,\" said Hu. Hu's use of ICESat-2 to make snow depth measurements directly would overcome limitations of existing methods that use airborne and space platforms. Airborne measurements can only cover limited areas. Historically, satellite measurements have been limited by the low resolution of passive sensors. More recently, scientists have used ICESat-2 to measure the top of the snow layer on sea ice and CryoSat-2's radar to \"see\" the top of the sea ice beneath the snow layer. However, geolocation differences of just 10 feet or so in where these two satellites take measurements can introduce significant inaccuracies to inferences of snow depth. Direct measurements of snow depth would increase understanding of the water cycle and snowfall, and satellite estimates of sea ice thickness, since so much sea ice is covered by snow. It is a critical measurement, especially as climate change intensifies. \"In general, snowpack has been decreasing and the snow season has been shortened in the contiguous United States during the last 50 years,\" said Hu. \"Predicting regional changes in snowfall has been difficult.\" Snow plays an important role in regulating climate because it reflects the Sun's energy back out into space and helps keep the planet cool. Less snow on the ground equals less reflectivity and more warming. Less snow on sea ice removes an insulating layer that prevents heat from the relatively warm ocean from escaping to the much colder atmosphere. According to Hu, if carbon dioxide doubles from current levels, most climate models consistently predict an increase in global rainfall of anywhere between 3 to 7 percent. Inversely, though, snowfall may decrease significantly in mid-latitude regions. Accurate snow measurements can help constrain the models. The innovation of Hu's team will advance climate scientists' abilities to better understand and interpret difficult-to-make snow depth measurements from space. Launched in",

    "date": null,
    "content": "5 min read Called EMIT, the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation will analyze dust carried through the atmosphere from dry regions to see what effects it has on the planet. Each year, strong winds carry more than a billion metric tons – or the weight of 10,000 aircraft carriers – of mineral dust from Earth’s deserts and other dry regions through the atmosphere. While scientists know that the dust affects the environment and climate, they don’t have enough data to determine, in detail, what those effects are or may be in the future – at least not yet. Launching to the International Space Station on June 9, NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument will help fill in those knowledge gaps. EMIT’s state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer, developed by the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, will collect more than a billion dust-source-composition measurements around the globe over the course of a year – and in doing so, significantly advance scientists’ understanding of dust’s influence across the Earth system. Here are five things to know about EMIT: Desert regions produce most of the mineral dust that makes its way into the atmosphere. They’re also largely remote, making it difficult for scientists to collect soil and dust samples over these vast areas by hand. From its perch on the space station, EMIT will map the world’s mineral dust source regions. The imaging spectrometer will also provide information on the color and composition of dust sources globally for the first time. This data will help scientists understand which kinds of dust dominate each region and advance their understanding of dust’s impact on climate and the Earth system today and in the future. Right now, scientists don’t know whether mineral dust has a cumulative heating or cooling effect on the planet. That’s because dust particles in the atmosphere have different properties. For instance, some particles may be dark red, while others may be white. The color matters because it determines whether the dust will absorb the Sun’s energy, as dark-colored minerals do, or reflect it, as light-colored minerals do. If more of the dust absorbs the Sun’s energy than reflects it, it’ll warm the planet, and vice versa. EMIT will provide a detailed picture of how much dust comes from dark versus light minerals. That information will allow scientists to determine whether dust heats or cools the planet overall, as well as regionally and locally. Mineral dust particles vary in color because they’re made of different substances. Dark red mineral dust gets its color from iron, for example. The composition of dust particles affects how they interact with many of Earth’s natural processes. For instance, mineral dust plays a role in cloud formation and atmospheric chemistry. When mineral dust is deposited in the ocean or forests, it can provide nutrients for growth, acting like fertilizer. When it falls on snow or ice, the dust accelerates melting, leading to more water runoff. And for humans, mineral dust can be a health hazard when inhaled. EMIT will collect information on 10 important dust varieties, including those that contain iron oxides, clays, and carbonates. With this data, scientists will be able to assess precisely what effects mineral dust has on different ecosystems and processes. In the absence of more specific data, scientists currently characterize mineral dust in climate models as yellow – a general average of dark and light. Because of this, the effects that mineral dust may have on climate – and that climate may have on mineral dust – are not well represented in computer models. Color and composition information gathered by EMIT will change that. When the instrument’s data is incorporated, the accuracy of climate models is expected to improve. As global temperatures rise, arid regions may become even drier, possibly resulting in larger (and dustier) deserts. To what extent this might happen depends on several factors, including how much temperatures rise, how land use changes, and how rainfall trends change. By incorporating EMIT’s global dust source composition data into models and predictions, scientists will gain a better understanding of how the amount and composition of dust in arid regions may change under different climate and land-use scenarios. They’ll also gain a better understanding of how these changes may impact climate in the future. EMIT is being developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena, California. It will launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida to the International Space Station aboard SpaceX’s 25th commercial resupply services mission for NASA. Once EMIT begins operation, its data will be delivered to the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for use by other researchers and the public.

    "date": null,
    "content": "7 min read By Angela Colbert, Ph.D.,NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Due to global warming, global climate models predict hurricanes will likely cause more intense rainfall and have an increased coastal flood risk due to higher storm surge caused by rising seas. Additionally, the global frequency of storms may decrease or remain unchanged, but hurricanes that form are more likely to become intense. From June 1 to November 30, many Americans turn their eyes to the tropics — not just because they’re dreaming of beach vacations, but because it’s hurricane season. Called by many names depending on where you live (hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones), scientists call these storms tropical cyclones. This is because they are large, rotating storms that need tropical conditions to form — so they originate mostly in the tropics. Note: Technically, hurricanes are tropical cyclones that have winds of more than 74 miles per hour (about 120 kilometers per hour). However, “hurricanes” will be used as a general term in this article to include tropical storms, which are tropical cyclones below hurricane intensity. With that said, let’s talk about some science behind hurricanes and how they may change due to global warming. Hurricanes need four main ingredients to form and strengthen: Just like making a perfect cookie, a hurricane needs all the ingredients for it to grow. Change any ingredient too much and the cookie will be too flat, too dry, too crumbly, etc. The same is true for hurricanes: If any of the four main ingredients changes too much, the storm cannot form or will weaken. Once a hurricane forms, scientists shift their focus to where it is going and how strong it will be when it gets there. Where a hurricane goes depends mainly on the large-scale weather patterns around it at the time. If it moves over land, it brings with it a fury of strong wind, drenching rain, dangerous storm surge and sometimes tornadoes. With so many moving parts, forecasting a hurricane is hard. Large-scale changes in the climate, such as El Niño and La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean, also impact hurricanes over an entire season. Thus, trying to determine how climate change will impact hurricanes may seem like an impossible task. However, important tools are in place to help scientists tackle it. These include sophisticated global climate models, scientific understanding of how hurricanes form and evolve, and expanding observational records of past hurricane activity. Tom Knutson, senior scientist at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, is a leading scientist on hurricanes and climate change. He notes that “even if hurricanes themselves don’t change [due to climate change], the flooding from storm surge events will be made worse by sea level rise.” In addition, he says models show increases in a hurricane’s rainfall rate by",

The guide, Building Alliances for Climate Action, includes various perspectives, stories, insights, and resources about climate change to help individuals and organizations make informed decisions. “NASA’s Earth observation and research supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate agenda, which outlines putting the climate crisis at the center of our nation’s foreign policy and national security,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “NASA is working hand in hand with FEMA to ensure communities across the U.S. and around the world have the resources they need to adapt in the face of extreme weather – which is increasing due to climate change.” The guide is a result of the Alliances for Climate Action, which NASA and FEMA co-hosted last year, a virtual series aimed at addressing rising demand for accurate, timely, and actionable information at a time of rapid global climate change. During the series, speakers shared their perspectives and paths to bolstering collective climate action. “To meet this moment, we need to invest in initiatives to break the cycles of disaster, damage, and reconstruction,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “Our actions now will directly impact the future. In the past, FEMA was criticized for insufficient action on climate change. This will not be our future.” NASA also partners with FEMA in other ways related to climate and Earth science. Before, during, and after disasters occur, NASA's Disasters Program coordinates with FEMA and other response agencies, decision-makers, and local governments to provide Earth-observing data and applied research results. NASA data inform choices, support decisions, and guide actions to build resilient communities. NASA’s Disasters Mapping Portal provides near-real-time data on current events. To improve access to key information, Nelson announced a concept for NASA’s Earth Information Center, which is an opportunity for the agency to leverage its data and modeling capabilities to work with trusted government and community partners with longstanding engagement in communities most affected by climate change. Supporting this effort are the Earth-observing missions we are flying today and building for the future. The center will complement the next generation of Earth observation satellites – NASA’s Earth System Observatory – to be launched by the end of this decade. As the next generation of missions to observe our planet, NASA’s observatory will provide a 3D, holistic view of Earth to help us better understand what our planet’s changes mean for humanity.

Credit: Davis Ranches/John Brennan By Esprit Smith, NASA's Earth Science News Team A NASA-led study links bird migration timing to large-scale climate patterns originating thousands of miles away. Every spring, migratory birds arrive in the continental United States from south and central America to breed. But precisely when they arrive each spring varies from year to year. In a NASA-led study published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, scientists have linked this variability to large-scale climate patterns originating thousands of miles away. Migratory birds benefit ecosystems by helping to control pests, pollinating plants and serving as food for other wildlife. The more land managers know about the current migration patterns of these birds – and the migration patterns that are likely to develop in the future due to climate change – the better they can direct their efforts to protect the birds and to restore and conserve their habitats. This study brings them one step closer to that goal. The scientists analyzed 23 years of bird migration data collected via NOAA’s Next Generation Radar system – a network of 143 radar stations across the continental U.S. – to determine the variability in the birds’ arrival times each spring. This is where they made their first discovery: The U.S. could be divided into two regions, east and west, each with a distinct pattern of variability in bird arrival times. The east region includes all areas east of 102 degrees west longitude – a line that, in the U.S., bisects North Dakota and extends down through Texas. The west region includes all areas west of that line. Bird migration in the U.S. is monitored in the context of four “flyways” or principle migration routes, two in the eastern U.S. and two in the western U.S. The new research digs into the different influences on each half of the country that affect the timing of environmental cues, such as temperature and weather patterns, that prompt birds to travel along their flyway. \"Our approach doesn’t replace the ‘flyways’ but rather introduces a different geographic framework that reflects the interannual variability of bird migration at the continental scale,” said Amin Dezfuli, scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study. “This framework helps us to better understand how climate patterns influence broadscale bird movements and migration variability.” In order to identify what was driving the variability in bird migration in each of these newly-defined regions, the science team analyzed meteorological and climate model data for both. They found that variability in the west region was strongly linked to regional air and sea surface temperature in the adjacent (Pacific) Ocean.

A new web-based platform called OpenET puts NASA data on water in 17 western states into the hands of users, helping them better calculate crop water requirements, use water more efficiently, and better plan irrigation. The “ET” in OpenET stands for evapotranspiration, which is the process through which water leaves plants, soils, and other surfaces and returns to the atmosphere. Warmer temperatures from climate change can even increase the rate at which water evaporates from plants, meaning many farms in the region need to increase irrigation to protect their crops. Evapotranspiration is a crucial measurement for farmers and other water-resource managers, especially in the western United States, where most of the water used by people goes to irrigate crops and produce food. The primary satellite dataset for OpenET is from the Landsat program, a partnership between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

Credit: U.S. Department of Energy The Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will make measurements of over 95% of Earth’s lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Water is life, but for all its importance, humanity has a surprisingly limited view of Earth’s freshwater bodies. Researchers have reliable water level measurements for only a few thousand lakes around the world, and little to no data on some of the planet’s important river systems. The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite will fill that enormous gap. By helping to provide a better understanding of Earth’s water cycle, it will both aid in better management of water resources and expand knowledge of how climate change affects lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. A collaboration between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatial (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency, SWOT is scheduled to launch in November from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Engineers and technicians are finishing up work on the satellite in a facility run by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes, France. SWOT has several key tasks, including measuring the height of water bodies on Earth’s surface. Over the ocean, the satellite will be able to “see” features like eddies less than 60 miles (100 kilometers) across – smaller than those that previous sea level satellites could observe. SWOT will also measure more than 95% of Earth’s lakes larger than 15 acres (6 hectares) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. “Current databases maybe have information on a couple thousand lakes around the world,” said Tamlin Pavelsky, the NASA freshwater science lead for SWOT, based at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “SWOT will push that number to between 2 million and 6 million.” Along with measuring the water height – whether it be in a lake, river, or reservoir – SWOT will also measure its extent, or surface area. That crucial information will enable scientists to calculate how much water moves through freshwater bodies. “Once you get hold of the volume of water, you can better assess the water budget, or how much water flows into and out of an area,” said Lee-Lueng Fu, SWOT project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the U.S. portion of the mission. This is important because climate change is accelerating Earth’s water cycle. Warmer temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more water (in the form of water vapor), which can cause, for example, rain storms to be stronger than a region might typically see. This, in turn, can wreak havoc on farms, damaging crops. Such accelerating changes can make managing a community’s water resources more difficult. “As Earth’s water cycle intensifies, predicting future extreme events like floods and droughts requires monitoring both changes in water supply from the ocean and water demand and usage on land. SWOT’s global look at all surface water on Earth will give us exactly that,” said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, SWOT’s program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. SWOT will provide its game-changing data using a new instrument called the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn), which bounces radar pulses off the water’s surface and receives the return signal with two antennas at the same time. The antennas are spaced 33 feet (10 meters) apart on a boom, enabling researchers to gather information along a roughly 75-mile-wide (120-kilometer-wide) swath of Earth’s surface – a wider path than that of the satellite’s predecessors. The engineering required for this kind of system is tricky because such a large antenna boom requires incredible stability, and because researchers need very precise calculations to produce measurements of Earth’s ocean and freshwater bodies. “The basic idea of SWOT dates back to the late",

    "content": "3 min read Encompassing Earth Data, Community Concerns, and Climate Change Earth's climate is changing, and one of the main impacts is on the water cycle. For example, there is an elevated risk of more frequent and intense flooding and droughts. Also, the amount of water flowing in individual streams and rivers is changing, and those changes affect water supplies to communities. NASA Earth science satellites and other remote-sensing techniques can fill in information gaps, but scientific data are just one piece of the larger puzzle when it comes to sustainable water resource management. What's needed, in addition to data, are strategies for information sharing, financing, and cooperation, among the many varied decision-makers in a watershed. That's according to a paper published in the January 17 edition of Nature Scientific Reports. “We as a scientific community need to take another step translating the science of climate change to assist stakeholders and water managers to achieve sustainable water management.” said lead author Ibrahim N. Mohammed of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. To manage this increased risk, a higher degree of coordination is needed around already difficult tasks such as dam management, flood mitigation, and coordination of water releases from reservoirs. The issue is particularly pressing in places that share water and rivers that cross political boundaries. To study these areas, Mohammed and his co-authors conducted a case study in the Mekong River Basin, where over 60 million people rely on rivers. “People living in the Mekong rely on it in so many ways,\" Mohammed said. “From everything from electricity from dams to fresh water, nearly every aspect of their social-economic lives rely on the management of this watershed,\" he said. To get a complete picture of the Mekong, NASA scientists worked with colleagues at the non-profit group Conservation International via the NASA Global Partnerships Program. The case study includes the river basins of the Se Kong, Se San, and Sre Pok rivers, known as the 3S watershed. This area includes three different countries: Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The study considered each country’s ability to plan for and manage future changes in the amount of water flowing into these rivers by incorporating social surveys from local decision makers. These surveys include information on adaptive management, information access, rule enforcement, and financial capacity. “One of the great things about the partnership is that it allows us to include cutting-edge science in the real world of water resources management,\" said co-author Derek Vollmer of Conservation International. \"Our understanding of the problem at hand is incomplete unless we are also looking at the decision-making context of, in this case, countries in the Lower Mekong region.” The study was made possible by NASA's Global Partnerships Program.

This information helps organizations like the federal Bureau of Land Management make more informed decisions on how to protect fish species and their ecosystems from threats from human development and a changing climate. The NASA team examined fish habitats in the roughly 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska — an area rich in both native fish populations and in oil and gas. They created maps that predict how likely it is for each fish species to appear in different parts of a stream by looking at satellite and remote sensing data on landscape characteristics like vegetation “greenness” and water temperatures. Then they combined that data with data taken from the water that showed the locations of fish species. The project is so promising that the Bureau of Land Management already plans to expand use of this tool to cover other parts of Alaska, and the NASA team is working on a similar project to monitor amphibians along the California coast.

    "content": "Newly installed on the space station, the instrument, called EMIT, will help answer questions about how mineral dust from Earth’s arid regions affects climate. After being installed on the exterior of the International Space Station, NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission has provided its first view of Earth. The milestone, called “first light,” took place at 7:51 p.m. PDT (10:51 p.m. EDT) on July 27 as the space station passed over Western Australia. Developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, EMIT is focused on mapping the mineral dust composition of Earth’s arid regions to better understand how dust affects climate heating and cooling. The instrument works by measuring the hundreds of wavelengths of light reflected from materials on Earth. Different substances reflect different wavelengths of light, producing a kind of spectral fingerprint that, when collected by an imaging spectrometer and analyzed by researchers, reveal what they are made of. Ground controllers used the Canadarm2 robotic arm of the space station to remove EMIT from a Dragon spacecraft and install it on the outside of the station, a process that began on July 22 and took more than 40 hours. Engineers powered on the instrument on July 24 and cooled it to its operating temperature over the next 72 hours. The EMIT team then collected the instrument’s first measurements, creating something called an image cube. The image at the front of the cube shows a mix of materials in Western Australia, including exposed soil (brown), vegetation (dark green), agricultural fields (light green), a small river, and clouds. The rainbow colors extending through the main part of the cube are the spectral fingerprints from corresponding spots in the front image. While the EMIT instrument can measure the spectral signature of light from such materials as vegetation, rocks, snow and ice, and human-made surfaces, its primary mission, beginning in August, will be to collect measurements of 10 important surface minerals (hematite, calcite, dolomite, and gypsum, for example) in arid, dust-producing regions of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Australia. The spectral fingerprints of dust minerals allow scientists to determine its composition. While dark, iron-rich particles strongly absorb the Sun’s energy, light-colored clays reflect it. Right now, scientists don’t know whether mineral dust has a cumulative heating or cooling effect on the planet. The full spectral fingerprints that EMIT collects will help answer that question. EMIT was developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech in Pasadena, California. It launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon resupply spacecraft carrying more than 5,800 pounds of science experiments, crew supplies, and other cargo from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 14. The instrument’s data will be delivered to the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for use by other researchers and the public.

The underwater eruption in the South Pacific Ocean also blasted an enormous plume of water vapor into Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The sheer amount of water vapor could be enough to temporarily affect Earth’s global average temperature. “We’ve never seen anything like it,” said Luis Millán, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

In the study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, Millán and his colleagues estimate that the Tonga eruption sent around 146 teragrams (1 teragram equals a trillion grams) of water vapor into Earth’s stratosphere – equal to 10% of the water already present in that atmospheric layer.

For every 1,000 sea turtle eggs laid, only about one turtle reaches adulthood due to natural predators and other obstacles. Those that do make it face numerous threats from humans. For example, they’re hunted in some regions for their meat, eggs and shells. Their beach habitats get developed. Harmful marine debris and oil spills pollute their waters and beaches. Now, climate change is exposing sea turtles to even greater existential threats. Sea level rise and stronger storms will erode and destroy their beach habitats. Warming oceans will change ocean currents, potentially introducing sea turtles to new predators and harming the coral reefs some of them need to survive. Since the temperature of the beach sand that female sea turtles nest in influences the sex of their offspring during incubation, our warming climate may be driving sea turtles into extinction by creating a shortage of males, according to several studies. — Alan Buis/NASA's Global Climate Change website Back to 'A Degree of Concern' > This website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at Site",

Assessing how the unique weather along Lake Michigan’s shoreline affects ground-level ozone is no easy task – the complex lake and land breezes across the Great Lakes area result in high levels of this type of air pollution and make it difficult to monitor. But it’s vital to understanding how this pollution circulates in the region. With NASA Earth observations, states can better understand how to account for the complex variations in wind patterns and pressure differences along the shores of Lake Michigan. Ozone pollution at the surface is dangerous for human health and a greenhouse gas that can contribute to climate change – but the increase in temperatures driven by climate change can also cause more frequent high-ozone days for local communities. Unhealthy amounts of ground-level ozone pollution can aggravate lung diseases such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis, and increase the frequency of asthma attacks – especially in children and the elderly. That’s why states are required to meet federal air quality standards.

Hyperspectral data from hundreds of wavelengths of reflected light can provide new information about Earth’s surface and atmosphere to help scientists understand Earth’s geology and biology, as well as the effects of climate change. The research project, called the Geological Earth Mapping Experiment (GEMx), will use NASA’s Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) instruments flown on NASA’s ER-2 and Gulfstream V aircraft to collect the measurements over the country’s arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. “This exciting new project is just one example of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to a clean energy future,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “NASA has a long history of Earth observation that shows us how the planet is responding to climate change. This project builds on our 60-year legacy, and can show us where to look for the resources that support our transition to a clean energy economy.

Watch video of EMIT’s launch and “first light” NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission is mapping the prevalence of key minerals in the planet’s dust-producing deserts – information that will advance our understanding of airborne dust’s effects on climate. But EMIT has demonstrated another crucial capability: detecting the presence of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. In the data EMIT has collected since being installed on the International Space Station in July, the science team has identified more than 50 “super-emitters” in Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Southwestern United States. Super-emitters are facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure, typically in the fossil-fuel, waste, or agriculture sectors, that emit methane at high rates. “Reining in methane emissions is key to limiting global warming. This exciting new development will not only help researchers better pinpoint where methane leaks are coming from, but also provide insight on how they can be addressed – quickly,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The International Space Station and NASA’s more than two dozen satellites and instruments in space have long been invaluable in determining changes to the Earth’s climate. EMIT is proving to be a critical tool in our toolbox to measure this potent greenhouse gas – and stop it at the source.” Methane absorbs infrared light in a unique pattern – called a spectral fingerprint – that EMIT’s imaging spectrometer can discern with high accuracy and precision. The instrument can also measure carbon dioxide. The new observations stem from the broad coverage of the planet afforded by the space station’s orbit, as well as from EMIT’s ability to scan swaths of Earth’s surface dozens of miles wide while resolving areas as small as a soccer field. “These results are exceptional, and they demonstrate the value of pairing global-scale perspective with the resolution required to identify methane point sources, down to the facility scale,” said David Thompson, EMIT’s instrument scientist and a senior research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the mission. “It’s a unique capability that will raise the bar on efforts to attribute methane sources and mitigate emissions from human activities.” Relative to carbon dioxide, methane makes up a fraction of human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions, but it’s estimated to be 80 times more effective, ton for ton, at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the 20 years after release. Moreover, where carbon dioxide lingers for centuries, methane persists for about a decade, meaning that if emissions are reduced, the atmosphere will respond in a similar timeframe, leading to slower near-term warming. Identifying methane point sources can be a key step in the process. With knowledge of the locations of big emitters, operators of facilities, equipment, and infrastructure giving off the gas can quickly act to limit emissions. EMIT’s methane observations came as scientists verified the accuracy of the imaging spectrometer’s mineral data. Over its mission, EMIT will collect measurements of surface minerals in arid regions of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Australia. The data will help researchers better understand airborne dust particles’ role in heating and cooling Earth’s atmosphere and surface. “We have been eager to see how EMIT’s mineral data will improve climate modeling,” said Kate Calvin, NASA’s chief scientist and senior climate advisor. “This additional methane-detecting capability offers a remarkable opportunity to measure and monitor greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.” The mission’s study area coincides with known methane hotspots around the world, enabling researchers to look for the gas in those regions to test the capability of the imaging spectrometer. “Some of the plumes EMIT detected are among the largest ever seen – unlike anything that has ever been observed from space,” said Andrew Thorpe, a research technologist at JPL leading the EMIT methane effort. “What we’ve found in a just a short time already exceeds our expectations.” For example, the instrument detected a plume about 2 miles (3.3 kilometers) long southeast of Carlsbad, New Mexico, in the Permian Basin. One of the largest oilfields in the world, the Permian spans parts of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. In Turkmenistan, EMIT identified 12 plumes from oil and gas infrastructure east of the Caspian Sea port city of Hazar. Blowing to the west, some plumes stretch more than 20 miles (32 kilometers). The team also identified a methane plume south of Tehran, Iran, at least 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) long, from a major waste-processing complex. Methane is a byproduct of decomposition, and landfills can be a major source.

The state’s size, rugged terrain, and limited transportation infrastructure make traditional stream gauging cost prohibitive. Credit: Derek Frohbieter, North Carolina Association of Floodplain Managers By Alan Buis, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will provide a trove of data on Earth’s water resources, even in remote locations. Alaska serves as a case study. While Alaska straddles the Arctic Circle and is covered by vast expanses of frozen land, the state also has a lot of liquid water. In fact, Alaska holds about 40% of U.S. surface water resources. This includes more than 12,000 rivers, thousands more streams and creeks, and hundreds of thousands of lakes. So when the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite launches this month from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base, it’s only natural that Alaska will be among the first beneficiaries of this mission led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency. SWOT will measure the height of nearly all water on Earth’s surface, from large rivers to lakes and reservoirs to the ocean. It will fill in gaps in remote places like Alaska and in many countries where surface water data are sparse or nonexistent. These measurements will be valuable to water management and disaster preparedness agencies, universities, civil engineers, and others who need to track water in their local areas. Alaska’s sheer size, rugged terrain, and limited transportation infrastructure make traditional stream gauging cost prohibitive. While streamflows in most of the United States are continuously monitored by a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) network of more than 8,500 stations, there are currently only 113 gauges in Alaska, and many big rivers aren’t monitored. The amount of water flowing through such rivers affects everything from the health and biodiversity of fish species to transportation and drinking water availability. This dearth of Alaskan river information made USGS a logical choice to serve as a SWOT early adopter. SWOT data will complement a system currently in development to monitor those rivers, using radar altimetry data from the U.S.-European Jason-2 and -3 and European Space Agency Sentinel satellites (developed in the context of the European Copernicus program led by the European Commission), and visible imagery from the NASA-USGS Landsat satellites. The project, in its third year, involves using space-borne instruments to measure the elevation and flow of rivers. USGS partners include the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, National Weather Service’s Alaska-Pacific River Forecast Center, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. “Alaska is a place that could particularly benefit from remote observation for streamflow estimates,” said USGS hydrologist Robert Dudley. Dudley said Alaska is a great test case for scientists and water managers to work with new space-based tools like SWOT and put them to immediate use. USGS is compiling a historical record of estimated stream discharges, building on more than two decades of NASA research to measure water surface levels in lakes and rivers. The data will allow scientists and water managers to understand how often streams experience low- and high-flow conditions and to develop a reference point to evaluate current conditions. Dudley says SWOT has numerous advantages over current satellite-based river measurement techniques. Altimeters like those on the Jason series of satellites can measure how water levels vary in some large rivers, and Landsat can measure how river widths vary. But neither data source by itself provides all the information needed to calculate a reasonable estimate of how much water is flowing through a river without doing difficult and costly on-the-ground calibration. SWOT changes that by measuring both water levels and width simultaneously. For example, if a river has steep banks, it won’t necessarily appear wider or narrower as its discharge rate changes. Conversely, even a tiny change in water elevation in a shallow-banked river can mean a lot more water is flowing through it. SWOT will also measure a river’s slope, which provides scientists a means to estimate how fast water is running off the landscape. Generally speaking, the steeper the slope, the faster the water. And SWOT will collect the data needed to estimate stream flows all at once, every time it flies over a river, which in Alaska will be about once every five days. SWOT’s radar also can see through clouds, eliminating data gaps caused by clouds in Landsat and other visible-light imagery. Climate change is causing numerous hydrological changes in Alaska that SWOT will help study, said Jack Eggleston, chief of the USGS Hydrologic Remote Sensing Branch. “Rapidly increasing temperatures are causing streamflows to increase on the North Slope, where permafrost is melting,” he said. “This is also changing the seasonality of streamflow, with high flows caused by snow melt occurring earlier in the year.” “SWOT is going to allow us to see what’s going on in Alaska hydrologically in ways that we haven’t before,” said Tamlin Pavelsky, NASA’s SWOT freshwater science lead, based at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “That’s important, because Alaska, being in the Arctic, is also the place in the United States experiencing the most climate change right now. If you want to know why that matters, think about how many resources we get from Alaska.” SWOT is being jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the CSA and the UK Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA is providing the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations.

    "content": "By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory A rigorous testing program is the best way to ensure that every part of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, down to the ball bearings, will work smoothly in orbit. Before any NASA mission is launched, the spacecraft goes through weeks of harsh treatment. It’s strapped to a big table that shakes as hard as the pounding of a rocket launch. It’s bombarded with louder noise than a stadium rock concert. It’s frozen, baked, and irradiated in a vacuum chamber that simulates the extremes of space. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission (SWOT), a collaborative U.S.-French mission to monitor all the water on Earth’s surface, has passed these major tests. Now, except for a few final checks, SWOT is ready for its December launch. Some of SWOT’s engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California have invested almost a decade in designing, building, and assembling this complex mission. Watching the instruments they’ve labored over go through the latest round of tests has been stressful, but the team has taken the process in stride. That’s because every part of SWOT, down to nuts and bolts, had been tested multiple times before the satellite entered the thermal vacuum chamber for the last time. The engineers say the earlier tests produced far more anxiety. Phoebe Rhodes-Wickett, a mechatronics engineer at JPL, has spent a quarter of her life working on SWOT. She initially focused on a small component used to deploy the antennas on the spacecraft’s main instrument. “The first time I tested my mechanism, I was terrified,” she said. About as big as a box of tissues, the component was tested on a full-size shaker table. “It was just this little mechanism sitting by itself. The test is loud, and you can see the mechanism moving,” added Rhodes-Wickett. “We had a failure in our first round of testing. We had to redesign and retest the mechanism in a few months’ time to get it certified as spaceworthy.” After passing that retest, the mechanism was connected to larger and larger systems that were finally integrated into the complete SWOT spacecraft. Every phase of spacecraft assembly creates new connections and presents another avenue for human error to creep in, so it ends with another round of tests. Rhodes-Wickett’s mechanism passed vibration testing three more times since that first experience. “Each test you pass is a relief,” she said, “but by the time you get to the third or fourth test, your stress level is much lower.” The mechanism is part of SWOT’s new radar instrument, which is the first of its kind in space. The Ka-band Radar Interferometer, or KaRIn, has two radar antennas mounted on mechanical arms. Once SWOT is in orbit, the arms will unfold from opposite sides of the spacecraft and extend until the antennas are almost 33 feet (10 meters) apart. Just as the space between your eyes helps you to judge distance and depth better, the space between KaRIn’s two antennas helps the instrument reveal more details about Earth’s water. But if the process isn’t almost perfect – if the mechanical arms don’t extend fully or the antennas are misaligned by even a few thousandths of a degree – KaRIn can’t make the hoped-for measurements. “It’s a unique part of a career at NASA that we’re always trying to build stuff that’s never been built before,” said JPL’s Eric Slimko, chief mechanical engineer on SWOT. That means every NASA payload starts with an unknown risk factor. Most missions gain some sense of the risk level by deploying prototype instruments on aircraft and in labs, but there’s still the (literally) sky-high additional challenge of adapting the technology to survive launch and work in space. “We don’t have the capability of eliminating all that risk by an analysis on a piece of paper,” he said. “We have to test it.” Even off-the-shelf parts are certified. Designing tests that could prove the folding arm and antenna assembly will perform as well in orbit as they do on Earth was “very, very challenging,” Slimko said. “For one thing, we can’t turn off gravity. But we developed a verification program that, even though we cannot re-create the exact flight environment on the ground, we still have complete confidence that it will work in space.” Carrying out the program required dozens of JPL engineers to spend weeks or months at the Thales Alenia Space facility in Toulouse, France, working with colleagues from the French space agency Centre Nationale d’Études Spatiales (CNES) to complete the series of tests as the spacecraft was assembled. The spacecraft includes hardware from not only CNES and NASA but also the United Kingdom and Canadian space agencies, with each team monitoring the performance of its own parts during testing. Now almost all that remains is the ultimate test: the launch itself. The engineers are more than ready. “It’s fun to have a baby that you literally dreamed up, helped to grow, and now you’re walking it to the finish line,” Rhodes-Wickett said. “It’s really exciting to see something that you’ve poured so much time and effort into go on and make a difference in the world.” SWOT is being jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency.

NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission aboard the International Space Station has produced its first mineral maps, providing detailed images that show the composition of the surface in regions of northwest Nevada and Libya in the Sahara Desert. Windy desert areas such as these are the sources of fine dust particles that, when lifted by wind into the atmosphere, can heat or cool the surrounding air. But scientists haven’t been able to assess whether mineral dust in the atmosphere has overall heating or cooling effects at local, regional, and global scales. EMIT’s measurements will help them to advance computer models and improve our understanding of dust’s impacts on climate. EMIT scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and the U.S. Geological Survey created the maps to test the accuracy of the instrument’s measurements, a crucial first step in preparing for full science operations. Installed on the space station in July, EMIT is the first of a new class of high-fidelity imaging spectrometers that collect data from space and produce better-quality data at greater volumes than previous instruments. “Decades ago, when I was in graduate school, it took 10 minutes to collect a single spectrum from a geological sample in the laboratory. EMIT’s imaging spectrometer measures 300,000 spectra per second, with superior quality,” said Robert Green, EMIT’s principal investigator and senior research scientist at JPL. “The data we’re getting from EMIT will give us more insight into the heating and cooling of Earth, and the role mineral dust plays in that cycle. It’s promising to see the amount of data we’re getting from the mission in such a short time,” said Kate Calvin, NASA’s chief scientist and senior climate advisor. “EMIT is one of seven Earth science instruments on the International Space Station giving us more information about how our planet is affected by climate change.” EMIT analyzes light reflected from Earth, measuring it at hundreds of wavelengths, from the visible to the infrared range of the spectrum. Different materials reflect light in different wavelengths. Scientists use these patterns, called spectral fingerprints, to identify surface minerals and pinpoint their locations. The Nevada map focuses on a mountainous area about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northeast of Lake Tahoe, revealing locations dominated by kaolinite, a light-colored mineral whose particles scatter light upward and cool the air as they move through the atmosphere.

Credit: CNES The international Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will provide high-definition data on the salt- and fresh water on Earth’s surface. SWOT media reel SWOT press kit On Dec. 12, NASA will launch the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite into Earth orbit from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California atop a Falcon 9 rocket. The mission is a collaborative effort between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) – with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency – that will survey water on more than 90% of the planet’s surface. The satellite will measure the height of water in Earth’s freshwater bodies and the ocean, providing insights into how the ocean influences climate change; how a warming world affects lakes, rivers, and reservoirs; and how communities can better prepare for disasters, like floods. Here are five ways that SWOT will change what we know about water on Earth: 1. SWOT will survey nearly all water on Earth’s surface for the first time. Water is essential for life on this planet. But it also plays a critical role in storing and moving much of the excess heat and carbon trapped in Earth’s atmosphere by greenhouse gas emissions. It influences our weather and climate as well. SWOT will help researchers track Earth’s water budget – where the water is today, where it’s coming from, and where it’s going to be tomorrow. This is key to understanding how water resources are changing, what impact those changes will have on local environments, and how the ocean reacts to and influences climate change. 2. SWOT will see Earth’s water in higher definition than ever before. The spacecraft’s science instruments will view the planet’s freshwater bodies and the ocean with unprecedented clarity. SWOT will be able to collect data on ocean features less than 60 miles (100 kilometers) across, helping to improve researchers’ understanding of the ocean’s role in climate change. Earth’s seas have absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers think that short-lived ocean features, such as fronts and eddies, absorb a lot of that heat – and the extra carbon that produced it. By providing a high-definition view of freshwater bodies, SWOT will help generate a much more complete picture of Earth’s water budget. Many big rivers remain a mystery to researchers, who can’t outfit them with monitoring instruments for various reasons, including inaccessibility. The spacecraft’s instruments will observe the entire length of nearly all rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters), viewing them in three dimensions for the first time. Likewise, where ground and satellite technologies currently provide data on only a few thousand of the world’s largest lakes, SWOT will expand that number to over a million lakes larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters). 3. The satellite will address some of the most pressing climate change questions of our time. An important part of predicting our future climate is determining at what point the ocean slows down the absorption of excess heat trapped in the atmosphere and starts releasing it back into the air, where it could accelerate global warming. SWOT will provide crucial information about this global ocean-atmosphere heat exchange, enabling researchers to test and improve climate forecasts. In addition, the satellite will help fill gaps in researchers’ picture of how sea level is changing along coastlines, offering insights that can then be used to improve computer models for sea level rise projections and the forecasting of coastal floods. 4. SWOT data will be used to inform decisions about our daily lives. Climate change is also accelerating Earth’s water cycle, leading to more volatile precipitation patterns, including torrential downpours and extreme droughts. Some communities around the world will thus experience floods while other suffer droughts. SWOT data will be used to monitor drought conditions in lakes and improve flood forecasts for rivers, providing essential information to water management agencies, disaster preparedness agencies, universities, civil engineers, and others who need to track water in their local areas. 5. This mission is paving the way for future NASA Earth missions while also building on a long-standing international partnership. With its innovative technology and commitment to engaging a diverse community of people who plan to use the mission’s data, SWOT is laying a path for future Earth-observing missions. Measurements from SWOT – and the tools to support researchers in analyzing the information – will be free and accessible. This will help to foster research and applications activities by a wide range of users, including those who may not usually have the opportunity to access this knowledge. Such an ambitious mission is possible because of a decades-long collaboration between NASA and CNES that started in the",

But, says atmospheric scientist David Crisp of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, that doesn’t necessarily mean that our society is. “The resilience of Earth’s atmosphere has been proven throughout our planet’s climate history,” said Crisp, science team lead for NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and its successor instrument, OCO-3, which launched to the International Space Station on May 4. “Humans have increased the abundance of carbon dioxide by 45 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Age. That’s making big changes in our environment, but at the same time, it’s not going to lead to a runaway greenhouse effect or something like that. So, our atmosphere will survive, but, as suggested by UCLA professor and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Jared Diamond, even the most advanced societies can be more fragile than the atmosphere is.” Changes to our atmosphere associated with reactive gases (gases that undergo chemical reactions) like ozone and ozone-forming chemicals like nitrous oxides, are relatively short-lived. Carbon dioxide is a different animal, however. Once it’s added to the atmosphere, it hangs around, for a long time: between 300 to 1,000 years. Thus, as humans change the atmosphere by emitting carbon dioxide, those changes will endure on the timescale of many human lives. Earth’s atmosphere is associated with many types of cycles, such as the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Crisp says that while our atmosphere is very stable, those cycles aren’t. “Humanity’s ability to thrive depends on these other planetary cycles and processes working the way they now do,” he said. “Thanks to detailed observations of our planet from space, we’ve seen some changes over the last 30 years that are quite alarming: changes in precipitation patterns, in where and how plants grow, in sea and land ice, in entire ecosystems like tropical rain forests. These changes should attract our attention. “One could say that because the atmosphere is so thin, the activity of 7.7 billion humans can actually make significant changes to the entire system,” he added. “The composition of Earth’s atmosphere has most certainly been altered. Half of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the last 300 years has occurred since",

The multiyear effort is being developed and conducted by the nonprofit Carbon Mapper organization. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, the source of roughly a quarter to a third of global warming caused by humans. The aim of the new initiative is to establish a baseline assessment of global waste sites that emit methane at high rates. This information can support decision-makers as they work to reduce the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere and limit climate change. Methane produced by the waste sector contributes an estimated 20% of human-caused methane emissions. Ton for ton, methane is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere. But where carbon dioxide remains in the air for centuries, methane has an atmospheric lifetime of only about a decade or two. That means some immediate slowing of atmospheric warming could be achieved if methane emissions were significantly reduced. “Currently, there is limited actionable information about methane emissions from the global waste sector. A comprehensive understanding of high-emission point sources from waste sites is a critical step to mitigating them,” said Carbon Mapper CEO Riley Duren. “New technological capabilities that are making these emissions visible – and therefore actionable – have the potential to change the game, elevating our collective understanding of near-term opportunities in this often overlooked sector.” Carbon Mapper received a grant from the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment to support its operations related to the waste-site initiative, including potential funding to cover airborne methane surveys using NASA airborne assets.

SWOT media reel SWOT press kit SWOT Teachable Moment Play SWOT launch bingo Set for a Thursday, Dec. 15 launch, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite promises to provide an extraordinary accounting of water over much of Earth’s surface. Its measurements of fresh water and the ocean will help researchers address some of the most pressing climate questions of our time and help communities prepare for a warming world. Making this possible is a scientific instrument called the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn). Years in development, the instrument has been designed to capture very precise measurements of the height of water in Earth’s freshwater bodies and the ocean. KaRIn will measure the height of water in the ocean, “seeing” features like currents and eddies that are less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across – up to 10 times smaller than those detectable with other sea level satellites. It will also collect data on lakes and reservoirs larger than 15 acres (62,500 square meters) and rivers wider than 330 feet (100 meters) across. “For freshwater, this will be a quantum leap in terms of our knowledge,” said Daniel Esteban-Fernandez, KaRIn instrument manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. For example, researchers currently have good data on only a few thousand lakes around the world; SWOT will increase that number to at least a million. The cutting-edge KaRIn instrument lies at the heart of this international mission, the latest in a longstanding collaboration between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the UK Space Agency. Until now, researchers looking to study a body of water relied on instruments that measure at specific locations – like gauges in rivers or the ocean – or that are space-based, gathering data along narrow “tracks” of Earth they can see from orbit. Researchers then have to extrapolate if they want a broader idea of what’s happening in a water body. KaRIn is different. The radar instrument uses the Ka-band frequency at the microwave end of the electromagnetic spectrum to penetrate cloud cover and the dark of night. As a result, it can take measurements regardless of weather or time of day. The instrument configuration consists of one antenna at each end of a boom that’s 33 feet (10 meters) long. By bouncing radar pulses off the water’s surface and receiving the return signal with both antennas, KaRIn will collect data along a swath 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide on either side of the satellite. “With KaRIn data, we’ll be able to actually see what’s happening, rather than relying on these extrapolations,” said Tamlin Pavelsky, the NASA freshwater science lead for SWOT, based at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The two KaRIn antennas will see the same spot on Earth from 553 miles (890 kilometers) above. Since the antennas look at a given point on Earth from two directions, the return signals reflected back to the satellite arrive at each antenna slightly out of step, or phase, with one another. Using this phase difference, the distance between the two antennas, and the radar wavelength, researchers can calculate the height of the water that KaRIn is looking at. Such a remarkable instrument demanded a lot from the team that developed it. For starters, there was the need for stability. “You have two antennas looking at the same spot on the ground, but if their footprints don’t overlap, you won’t see anything,” said Esteban-Fernandez. That was one of the many technical challenges the mission faced in creating KaRIn. Engineers also need to know exactly how SWOT is positioned in space to ensure the accuracy of KaRIn’s data. If researchers don’t know the spacecraft is tilted, for instance, they can’t account for that in their calculations. “Imagine that the boom rolls because the spacecraft moves, so one antenna is slightly higher than the other,” Esteban-Fernandez said. “That will skew the results – it’ll look like all your water is on a slope.” So engineers included a high-performance gyroscope on the satellite to account for shifts in SWOT’s position. Engineers designing KaRIn also had to contend with the amount of radar power transmitted. “To measure things down to centimeter accuracy, you need to transmit radar pulses of 1.5 kilowatts, which is a huge amount of power for a satellite like this,” said Esteban-Fernandez. “In order to generate that, you have to have tens of thousands of volts operating on the satellite.” The engineers needed to use designs and materials specific to high-voltage systems when manufacturing the electronics to help the satellite accommodate such high-power and high-voltage needs. The team spent years overcoming those and a multitude of other challenges to deliver the KaRIn instrument. Very soon the interferometer will fly for the first time on the SWOT satellite and start sending back terabytes of data. “KaRIn will be putting something on the table that just didn’t exist before,” said Esteban-Fernandez. Scheduled to launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Central California on Dec. 15, SWOT is being jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the CSA and the UK Space Agency.

But before it can do that, the satellite would need to unfold its large mast and antenna panels (see above) after successfully deploying the solar panel arrays that power the spacecraft. The mission monitors and controls the satellite using telemetry data, but it also equipped spacecraft with four customized commercial cameras to record the action. The solar arrays fully deployed shortly after launch, taking about 10 minutes. The antennas successfully deployed over four days, a process that was completed on Dec. 22. The two cameras focused on the KaRIn antennas captured the mast extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place but stopped short of capturing the antennas being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data.) Thirty-three feet (10 meters) apart, at either end of the mast, the two antennas belong to the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. Designed to capture precise measurements of the height of water in Earth’s freshwater bodies and the ocean, KaRIn will see eddies, currents, and other ocean features less than 13 miles (20 kilometers) across.

Credit: Cloud Cap / Adobe Stock By Carol Rasmussen, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory This source accounts for about 10% of all the water that enters this highly productive farmland, including rivers and rain. In a recent study, scientists found that a previously unmeasured source – water percolating through soil and fractured rock below California’s Sierra Nevada mountains – delivers an average of 4 million acre feet (5 cubic kilometers) of water to the state’s Central Valley each year. This underground source accounts for about 10% of all the water that enters this highly productive farmland each year from every source (including river inflows and precipitation). The Central Valley encompasses only 1% of U.S. farmland but produces 40% of the nation’s table fruits, vegetables, and nuts annually. That’s only possible because of intensive groundwater pumping for irrigation and river and stream flow captured in reservoirs. For at least 60 years, growers have been pumping more water from aquifers than can be replenished by natural sources, causing the ground level to sink and requiring wells to be drilled deeper and deeper. As water grows more scarce in the Central Valley due to climate change and human use, a more detailed understanding of the natural movement of groundwater offers a chance to better protect the remaining resources. In the recently published study led by scientist Donald Argus of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, researchers found that groundwater volume fluctuates more widely between dry and wet years than had been previously understood.

Joint NASA, CNES Water-Tracking Satellite Reveals First Stunning Views NASA Uses 30-Year Satellite Record to Track and Project Rising Seas Ranking Atmospheric Rivers: New Study Finds World of Potential Using two decades of NASA satellite measurements stored in the cloud, scientists recently assessed the vulnerability of Belize’s renowned coral reefs to bleaching and collapse. The findings could help management authorities protect the reefs from human impacts such as development, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. The 185-mile-long (298-kilometer-long) barrier reef system off the coast of Belize encompasses vibrant marine environments that support thousands of animal and plant species and drive the Central American country’s largest industry, tourism. The system is one of about 1,200 UNESCO World Heritage sites around the world. In a study published in Frontiers in Remote Sensing, the scientists ranked 24 marine protected areas off the Belize coast based on the risks coral face from murky water and rising temperatures. The study also outlined how researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and counterparts in Belize used free, cloud-based data on Google Earth Engine in their analysis. “We depend on the reef for so many things, so conserving these resources is important,” said Emil Cherrington, a native Belizean and co-author of the paper. He is a research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and a co-investigator on the Belize Sustainable Development Goal project, a NASA effort to use Earth observation data to protect the country’s marine ecosystems. “Studies like this are giving the government of Belize more tools for conserving the resources that the country has.” The hard skeletons of stony coral form the structure of the barrier reef, which keeps Belize’s shallow coastal waters calm and enables marine life to thrive there. Coral needs clear water and consistent temperatures to grow. Changes in both factors can affect the survival of the symbiotic algae that live in the coral and provide food. When the algae leave or die, the coral lose their color, a phenomenon called bleaching. Coral can survive under these conditions, but the changes can put it at greater risk of mortality. To gather data on water clarity and surface temperature over large areas, researchers turned to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which was developed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and launched in",

The data shows Kelvin waves – which are roughly 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) high at the ocean surface and hundreds of miles wide – moving from west to east along the equator toward the west coast of South America. When they form at the equator, Kelvin waves bring warm water, which is associated with higher sea levels, from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific. A series of Kelvin waves starting in spring is a well-known precursor to an El Niño, a periodic climate phenomenon that can affect weather patterns around the world. It is characterized by higher sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures along the western coasts of the Americas. Water expands as it warms, so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water. El Niño is also associated with a weakening of the trade winds.

The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite is sending down tantalizing views of Earth’s water, including a global composite of sea surface heights. The satellite collected the data visualized above during SWOT’s first full 21-day science orbit, which it completed between July 26 and Aug. 16. SWOT is measuring the height of nearly all water on Earth’s surface, providing one of the most detailed, comprehensive views yet of the planet’s oceans and freshwater lakes and rivers. The satellite is a collaboration between NASA and the French space agency, CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales). The animation shows sea surface height anomalies around the world: Red and orange indicate ocean heights that were higher than the global mean sea surface height, while blue represents heights lower than the mean. Sea level differences can highlight ocean currents, like the Gulf Stream coming off the U.S. East Coast or the Kuroshio current off the east coast of Japan. Sea surface height can also indicate regions of relatively warmer water – like the eastern part of the equatorial Pacific Ocean during an El Niño – because water expands as it warms. The SWOT science team made the measurements using the groundbreaking Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. With two antennas spread 33 feet (10 meters) apart on a boom, KaRIn produces a pair of data swaths (tracks visible in the animation) as it circles the globe, bouncing radar pulses off the water’s surface to collect surface-height measurements. “The detail that SWOT is sending back on sea levels around the world is incredible,” said Parag Vaze, SWOT project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “The data will advance research into the effects of climate change and help communities around the world better prepare for a warming world.” Launched on Dec. 16,",

    "title": "NASA-Funded Scientists Estimate Carbon Stored in African Dryland Trees",
    "date": null,
    "content": "Using commercial, high-resolution satellite images and artificial intelligence, an international team including NASA scientists mapped almost 10 billion individual trees in Africa’s drylands in order to assess the amount of carbon stored outside of the continent’s dense tropical forests. The result is the first comprehensive estimate of tree carbon density in the Saharan, Sahel, and Sudanian zones of Africa. The team reported its findings March 1 in Nature, and the data are free and publicly available. The researchers found there are far more trees spread across semi-arid regions of Africa than previously thought, but that they also store less carbon than some models have predicted. In the new study, the team estimated roughly 0.84 petagrams of carbon are locked up in African drylands; a petagram is 1 billion metric tons. Having an accurate tree carbon estimate is essential for climate change projections, which are influenced by how long trees and other vegetation store carbon. This “carbon residence time,” as scientists call it, is very short for grasses and bushes, which grow seasonally, but much longer for trees that grow for years. Knowing how much carbon a landscape stores is dependent on knowing exactly what is growing there. Beyond the vast tropical forests spread across the middle of the continent, African landscapes range from dry grasslands with a few trees to savannahs with scattered trees to more humid areas with many scattered trees. This dispersed tree cover has made it difficult for scientists working to estimate the number of trees in these areas, and there have often been over- or underestimates. Yet such measurements are essential for conservation efforts and for understanding the carbon cycle on our planet. “Our team gathered and analyzed carbon data down to the individual tree level across the vast semi-arid regions of Africa or elsewhere – something that had previously been done only on small, local scales,\" said Compton Tucker, lead scientist on the project and an Earth scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Previous satellite-based estimates of tree carbon in Africa’s drylands often mistook grasses and shrubs for trees. “That led to over-predictions of the carbon there.” Carbon is constantly cycling between the land, the atmosphere, the ocean, and back. Trees remove carbon dioxide – a greenhouse gas – from Earth’s atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis and store it in their roots, trunks, branches, and leaves. For this reason, increasing tree cover is often suggested as a way to offset ever-increasing carbon emissions. In the new study, the team used sophisticated machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to sort through more than 326,000 commercial satellite images from the QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites (operated by Maxar Technologies). The researchers acquired the images through NASA's Center for Climate Simulation and leveraged its Explore/ADAPT Science Cloud to organize and prepare the images for machine learning processing. Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen compiled AI training data from 89,000 individual trees. Colleague Ankit Kariyaa, also at Copenhagen, adapted a neural network so that computers could detect the individual trees in high-resolution 50-centimeter scale images of Africa's drier, less verdant landscapes. The researchers defined a “tree” as anything with a green, leafy crown and an adjacent shadow. From this, they trained the machine learning software to count the trees during millions of hours of supercomputing on the Blue Waters supercomputer at the University of Illinois. When the team compared their machine-learning results with human assessments of the landscape, the computers were 96.5% correct in measuring tree-crown area. From measurements of tree crown area, the scientists can derive the amount of carbon in each tree’s leaves, roots, and wood using allometry – the study of how the characteristics of living creatures change with size. A group led by Pierre Hiernaux of the University of Toulouse examined 30 different species of trees to measure leaf mass, wood mass, and root mass. They assessed those masses of carbon and established a statistical relationship to tree crown area. The African tree carbon data are publicly available with a viewer app developed by the team. It allows people to view every tree in the study area and the amount of carbon it stores. These data could be useful for scientists and students studying the carbon cycle, policymakers trying to improve conservation efforts, and farmers who want to determine the carbon stored in their farm.

Much has been written about the major impacts of climate change. Effects such as rising global surface temperatures, higher sea levels, longer and more intense heat waves, melting glaciers and ice sheets, polar sea ice loss, extreme weather and climate events, and impacts on animal habitats are well-documented and in the news regularly. In this new NASA Climate feature series, we’re examining some of the lesser-known, and often surprising, ways Earth’s changing climate is affecting our world. Before the Industrial Revolution, human travels had little impact on Earth’s climate. That changed once we began burning fossil fuels to power trains, boats, cars, trucks, and planes. Today, transportation generates about a fourth of global carbon dioxide emissions, second only to the electric power sector. Climate change is affecting transportation in major ways, such as the ongoing shift to zero-emissions automobiles. But some of the impacts of climate on transportation are less obvious. Here are a few.

Jet streams are fast-moving belts of wind that travel around the planet in wavy, meandering paths in the upper parts of the atmosphere. Aviators often use or avoid them to increase the efficiency of their flights. Vertical wind shear creates irregular air motions called turbulence, which is a significant and costly issue for airlines, resulting in injuries, damaged aircraft, delayed flights, and inspections and investigations. Sometimes bumpy flights happen without significant cloudiness or thunderstorms. This phenomenon is known as “clear-air turbulence.” British atmospheric scientist Paul Williams of the University of Reading studies clear-air turbulence. Among his findings: NASA develops technologies to improve aviation efficiency and maintain safety. Researchers at NASA’s Langley Research Center recently designed a special infrasound microphone that can \"hear\" ultralow frequencies generated by turbulence. This technology was tested on an uncrewed stratospheric glider called HiDRON. Climate change can also make it harder for aircraft to take off. As temperatures rise, air becomes less dense, so planes have a harder time generating the lift they need to become airborne. Because of this, some aircraft runways may not be long enough for certain planes to take off. It also might force aircraft operators to reduce the takeoff weight of planes and helicopters. One of its most significant changes to the planet is the continuing decline of Arctic sea ice. Over the past 40 years, the amount of ice cover at both the annual maximum and minimum has shrunk, and the percentage of thick ice that survives from year to year has also dropped. As reported in",

The instrument is an advanced imaging spectrometer that measures hundreds of wavelengths of light reflected by Earth’s surface and absorbed by gases in the planet’s atmosphere. Different compounds – including methane and carbon dioxide – absorb different wavelengths of light, leaving a spectral “fingerprint” that the imaging spectrometer can identify. These infrared fingerprints, invisible to the human eye, can pinpoint and quantify strong greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate potential mitigation efforts.

In an interactive new exhibit at the NASA Headquarters in Washington, visitors are invited to see Earth as NASA sees it from space. For six decades, NASA satellites, sensors, and scientists have collected data on Earth’s land, water, air, and climate. At the Earth Information Center, the public can glimpse what this data has taught us about sea level rise, air quality, wildfires, greenhouse gases, ice cover, and agriculture. NASA and its partners gather observations and provide information that supports decision-makers in developing the tools they need to mitigate, adapt, and respond to climate change. Such information also helps people prepare for the impacts of natural hazards—from emergency managers assessing landslide risks to farmers accessing drought and storm information to land-use planners assessing development and recovery in wildfire-prone areas. The Earth Information Center is both a physical space and a web-based experience drawing on research conducted by teams at NASA’s different centers, at academic institutions, and by industry partners. The physical space is in the east lobby of NASA Headquarters. It is open to visitors from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. EDT each Monday through Friday. The website is still in beta testing. \"Teamwork enabled the success of this project, which included contributions from just about every NASA center and six partners across the government,\" said Laura Rogers, a NASA scientist and strategic lead of the center. “We brought together very different perspectives — blending things like the view from space with the view from behind the wheel of a tractor — to make complex data and concepts more accessible through visuals and sound. The center is a powerful combination of space, science, Earth, and art.” “There is a bit of beauty and mystery which draws you into the center and leads you to start asking questions,” said Daniel Goods, who leads The Studio at JPL, one of the designers of the center. “Then you’re in the mindset for learning.” As visitors enter the exhibit, they will be greeted by chirping birds and other natural sounds. Once inside, they will find a 22-foot LED hyperwall framed by two circular 4K screens. The hyperwall show tells the story of our planet through videos and visualizations on subjects like air pollution, agriculture, and hurricanes. It also includes dashboards with real-time data and imagery of our planet. The data visualizations reflect how the study of Earth system science works, combining scientific models, satellite observations, and ground measurements from teams across the agency and across the government, said Helen-Nicole Kostis, a data visualization developer at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and key member of the Earth Information Center team. “The visualizations feature the latest data available, updated as often as six minutes, with the goal of making scientific data accessible to people,” Kostis said. The Earth Information Center also includes a chandelier-like sculpture that depicts real-time satellite data transfers between space and ground receivers. Different patterns and speeds represent the amount of data being transferred and how quickly it reaches its destination. Visitors can also track NASA’s Earth science missions in real time by using the exhibit’s touchscreen kiosk, which allows visitors to interact with a 3D globe and zoom in to areas of interest. They can view satellite imagery of recent natural events while also monitoring Earth’s vital signs such as carbon dioxide concentrations, ozone holes, and sea level. An exhibit titled Space for Earth invites viewers to experience Earth as an interconnected world, lacking boundaries or limits. Narrated by NASA astronaut Drew Feustel and retired NASA astronaut Nicole Stott, the seven-minute story is told in an immersive room with data visualizations and images projected onto the walls and floor to connect visitors to their home planet. “When you've gone through this experience—whether you are a teenager or a college student or an adult or a senior—there's something there that can open a window into our world as NASA studies it,” Goods said. “When you go into the Space for Earth space, it's still showing you real data, but it's showing it to you in a way that touches the senses as much as the mind.” NASA is continuing to develop the Earth Information Center with its founding partners from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA).

Others are human-produced, like growing and harvesting crops, musical rhythms or economic cycles. Cycles also play key roles in Earth’s short-term weather and long-term climate.

Specifically, he examined how variations in three types of Earth orbital movements affect how much solar radiation (known as insolation) reaches the top of Earth’s atmosphere as well as where the insolation reaches. These cyclical orbital movements, which became known as the Milankovitch cycles, cause variations of up to 25 percent in the amount of incoming insolation at Earth’s mid-latitudes (the areas of our planet located between about 30 and 60 degrees north and south of the equator). The Milankovitch cycles include: Let’s take a look at each (further reading on why Milankovitch cycles can't explain Earth's current warming here).

Over time, the pull of gravity from our solar system’s two largest gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, causes the shape of Earth’s orbit to vary from nearly circular to slightly elliptical. Eccentricity measures how much the shape of Earth’s orbit departs from a perfect circle. These variations affect the distance between Earth and the Sun. Eccentricity is the reason why our seasons are slightly different lengths, with summers in the Northern Hemisphere currently about 4.5 days longer than winters, and springs about three days longer than autumns. As eccentricity decreases, the length of our seasons gradually evens out. The difference in the distance between Earth’s closest approach to the Sun (known as perihelion), which occurs on or about January 3 each year, and its farthest departure from the Sun (known as aphelion) on or about July 4, is currently about 5.1 million kilometers (about 3.2 million miles), a variation of 3.4 percent. That means each January, about 6.8 percent more incoming solar radiation reaches Earth than it does each July. When Earth’s orbit is at its most elliptic, about 23 percent more incoming solar radiation reaches Earth at our planet’s closest approach to the Sun each year than does at its farthest departure from the Sun. Currently, Earth’s eccentricity is very slowly decreasing and is approaching its least elliptic (most circular), in a cycle that spans about 100,000 years. The total change in global annual insolation due to the eccentricity cycle is very small. Because variations in Earth’s eccentricity are fairly small, they’re a relatively minor factor in annual seasonal climate variations.

Obliquity is why Earth has seasons. Over the last million years, it has varied between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees with respect to Earth’s orbital plane. The greater Earth’s axial tilt angle, the more extreme our seasons are, as each hemisphere receives more solar radiation during its summer, when the hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and less during winter, when it is tilted away. Larger tilt angles favor periods of deglaciation (the melting and retreat of glaciers and ice sheets). These effects aren’t uniform globally -- higher latitudes receive a larger change in total solar radiation than areas closer to the equator. Earth’s axis is currently tilted 23.4 degrees, or about half way between its extremes, and this angle is very slowly decreasing in a cycle that spans about 41,000 years. It was last at its maximum tilt about 10,000 years ago and will reach its minimum tilt about 10,000 years from now. As obliquity decreases, it gradually helps make our seasons milder, resulting in increasingly warmer winters, and cooler summers that gradually, over time, allow snow and ice at high latitudes to build up into large ice sheets. As ice cover increases, it reflects more of the Sun’s energy back into space, promoting even further cooling. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Precession – As Earth rotates, it wobbles slightly upon its rotational axis, like a slightly off-center spinning toy top. This wobble is due to tidal forces caused by the gravitational influences of the Sun and Moon that cause Earth to bulge at the equator, affecting its rotation. The trend in the direction of this wobble relative to the fixed positions of stars is known as axial precession. The cycle of axial precession spans about 25,771.5 years. Axial precession makes seasonal contrasts more extreme in one hemisphere and less extreme in the other. Currently perihelion occurs during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and in summer in the Southern Hemisphere. This makes Southern Hemisphere summers hotter and moderates Northern Hemisphere seasonal variations. But in about 13,000 years, axial precession will cause these conditions to flip, with the Northern Hemisphere seeing more extremes in solar radiation and the Southern Hemisphere experiencing more moderate seasonal variations. Precession does affect seasonal timing relative to Earth's closest/farthest points around the Sun. However, the modern calendar system ties itself to the seasons, and so, for example, the Northern Hemisphere winter will never occur in July. Today Earth’s North Stars are Polaris and Polaris Australis, but a couple of thousand years ago, they were Kochab and Pherkad. There’s also apsidal precession. Not only does Earth wobble on its rotational axis, but Earth’s entire orbital ellipse – that is, the oval-shaped path Earth follows in its orbit around the Sun — also wobbles irregularly, primarily due to its interactions with Jupiter and Saturn. The cycle of apsidal precession spans about 112,000 years. Apsidal precession changes the orientation of Earth’s orbit relative to the ecliptic plane. The combined effects of axial and apsidal precession result in an overall precession cycle spanning about 23,000 years on average. A Climate Time Machine The small changes set in motion by Milankovitch cycles operate separately and together to influence Earth’s climate over very long timespans, leading to larger changes in our climate over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Milankovitch combined the cycles to create a comprehensive mathematical model for calculating differences in solar radiation at various Earth latitudes along with corresponding surface temperatures. The model is sort of like a climate time machine: it can be run backward and forward to examine past and future climate conditions. Milankovitch assumed changes in radiation at some latitudes and in some seasons are more important than others to the growth and retreat of ice sheets. In addition, it was his belief that obliquity was the most important of the three cycles for climate, because it affects the amount of insolation in Earth’s northern high-latitude regions during summer (the relative role of precession versus obliquity is still a matter of scientific study). He calculated that Ice Ages occur approximately every 41,000 years. Subsequent research confirms that they did occur at 41,000-year intervals between one and three million years ago. But about 800,000 years ago, the cycle of Ice Ages lengthened to 100,000 years, matching Earth’s eccentricity cycle. While various theories have been proposed to explain this transition, scientists do not yet have a clear answer. Milankovitch’s work was supported by other researchers of his time, and he authored numerous publications on his hypothesis. But it wasn’t until about 10 years after his death in",

Local climate variabilities factor into their impact. Credit: Adobe Stock/siajames No stranger to hot weather, the region is facing more humid heat waves that test the adaptability of its residents. But different areas feel different effects. Like much of the planet, Southern California is expected to experience more heat waves in the future due to Earth’s changing climate. And some of these will feel increasingly humid, as long-term forecasts call for muggy spells more typically associated with Florida or eastern Texas. To begin to understand what these changes could mean across the greater Los Angeles area, scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California mapped how extreme heat and humidity patterns vary with regional geography. The results underscore how air temperature alone does not tell the full story of dangerous heat. “We can’t just look at air temperature when we talk about heat wave impacts,” said study author Anamika Shreevastava, a NASA postdoctoral program fellow at JPL. “People tend to get acclimatized to where they live. We have to understand how anomalous conditions are making a difference in what people are used to.” Climate change is fueling longer, hotter, and more frequent heat waves. In the U.S., extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer, causing more deaths than hurricanes and floods, according to the National Weather Service. Greater Los Angeles is a prime example of an urban heat island – cities and suburbs woven with heat-trapping concrete and asphalt that lead to warmer temperatures than nearby rural areas that have more vegetation. Bordered by mountains and the ocean, the Greater L.A. area encompasses suburbs and skyscrapers, with a dense population and disparities in green space. It includes several counties, tens of thousands of square miles, and more than 18 million people, making it a compelling test bed for heat wave research. Climate change and urban heat are together fueling different heat waves now. In the 20th century, most heat waves in L.A. were dry.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The international Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission is able to measure ocean features, like El Niño, closer to a coastline than previous space-based missions. Warm ocean waters from the developing El Niño are shifting north along coastlines in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Along the coast of California, these warm waters are interacting with a persistent marine heat wave that recently influenced the development of Hurricane Hilary. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite is able to spot the movement of these warm ocean waters in unprecedented detail. A collaboration between NASA and the French space agency, CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales), SWOT is measuring the height of nearly all water on Earth’s surface, providing one of the most detailed, comprehensive views yet of the planet’s oceans and fresh water lakes and rivers. Water expands as it warms, so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water. El Niño – a periodic climate phenomenon that can affect weather patterns around the world – is characterized by higher sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures along the western coast of the Americas. The image above shows sea surface heights off the U.S. West Coast, near the California-Oregon border, in August. Red and orange indicate higher-than-average ocean heights, while blue and green represent lower-than-average heights. The SWOT science team made the measurements with the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) instrument. With two antennas spread 33 feet (10 meters) apart on a boom, KaRIn produces a pair of data swaths as it circles the globe, bouncing radar pulses off the water’s surface to collect water-height measurements. The visualization combines data from two passes of the SWOT satellite. “SWOT’s ability to measure sea surface so close to the coast will be invaluable for researchers but also forecasters looking at things like the development and progress of worldwide phenomena like El Niño,” said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Watch Latest Water Satellite Unfold Itself in Space In its September outlook, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast a greater than 70% chance for a strong El Niño this coming winter. In addition to warmer water, El Niño is also associated with a weakening of the equatorial trade winds. The phenomenon can bring cooler, wetter conditions to the U.S. Southwest and drought to countries in the western Pacific, such as Indonesia and Australia. Launched on Dec. 16,",

    "content": "The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Global climate change is not a future problem. Changes to Earth’s climate driven by increased human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner. Effects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Some changes (such as droughts, wildfires, and extreme rainfall) are happening faster than scientists previously assessed. In fact, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — the United Nations body established to assess the science related to climate change — modern humans have never before seen the observed changes in our global climate, and some of these changes are irreversible over the next hundreds to thousands of years. Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many decades, mainly due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.

    "content": "“Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. detailed answer “Weather” refers to the more local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours, to days to weeks. Examples are familiar – rain, snow, clouds, winds, thunderstorms, sleet, and hail. “Climate” refers to longer-term averages (which may be regional or global) and can be thought of as the weather averaged over several decades. detailed answer Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. However, if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries. detailed answer Yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are causing global warming and climate change. detailed answer NASA’s role is to make observations of our Earth's systems (geosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere)--and how they connect--that can be used by the public, researchers, policymakers and to support strategic decision-making. The core responsibility of NASA is to conduct rigorous scientific research. It's important to clarify that NASA does not advocate for specific climate policies. detailed answer Climate researchers employ a wide range of direct and indirect measurements to thoroughly investigate Earth's climate history. These measurements include data from natural sources like tree rings, ice cores, corals, and sediments from oceans and lakes. Additionally, data from satellites in space, instruments on the International Space Station, aircraft, ships, buoys, and ground-based instruments are all vital for this research. This comprehensive array of data sources allows scientists to gain a detailed understanding of Earth's climate history. detailed answer Modern weather observations primarily originate from a network of sources, including weather stations, weather balloons, radar systems, ships, buoys, and satellites. detailed answer No. The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) utilizes temperature data for conducting long-term climate studies. To ensure the reliability of station data for such research, it's crucial that the time series of observations are consistent. We need to eliminate any temperature fluctuations that are not caused by climate-related factors. These fluctuations can occur due to station relocations, equipment upgrades, or the merging of data from various sources into a single dataset. detailed answer Not yet. In order to use temperature data effectively, we have to make adjustments to account for all the changes that have occurred over the past 100-150 years. detailed answer Major climate research organizations worldwide have developed mathematically rigorous, peer-reviewed data-processing methods to identify and compensate for changes in observing conditions. detailed answer The global temperature records calculated by U.S. and other countries are remarkably similar, even though they use different methods to process the data. NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and other respected groups subject their techniques and processed data to extensive peer-reviewed analyses. detailed answer Almost half of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) corrected data are cooler than the original records. NOAA's corrections of temperatures over the oceans — done to compensate for changes in methods of observing the temperature of water at the surface of the ocean — reduced the warming trend in global temperature. detailed answer No, the original records are preserved and are available at no cost online. You can access the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) U.S. and global records here. detailed answer The greenhouse effect is the process through which heat is trapped near Earth's surface by substances known as 'greenhouse gases.' Imagine these gases as a cozy blanket enveloping our planet, helping to maintain a warmer temperature than it would have otherwise. Greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a 'feedback', because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially caused the warming. detailed answer The amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbed by Earth's life forms, ocean, and other \"sinks\" might decrease as time goes by. Natural carbon sinks (the carbon absorbers, as opposed to \"sources,\" which release carbon) on land and in the ocean have become less effective over time. That is, natural sinks that removed about 60% of annual human-caused CO2 emissions in",

    "content": "Existe evidencia inequívoca de que la Tierra se está calentando a un ritmo sin precedentes. La actividad humana es la causa principal. In English El clima de la Tierra ha cambiado a lo largo de la historia. Solo en los últimos 800.000 años, ha habido ocho ciclos de glaciaciones y períodos más cálidos, y el final de la última glaciación hace unos 11.700 años marcó el comienzo de la era climática moderna y de la civilización humana. La mayoría de estos cambios climáticos se atribuyen a variaciones muy pequeñas en la órbita de la Tierra que cambian la cantidad de energía solar que recibe nuestro planeta. Obtén más información sobre los núcleos de hielo. La tendencia de calentamiento actual es diferente porque es claramente el resultado de las actividades humanas desde mediados del siglo XIX y avanza a un ritmo que no se ha visto en muchos milenios recientes.1 Es innegable que las actividades humanas han producido los gases atmosféricos que han atrapado una mayor parte de la energía del Sol en el sistema de la Tierra. Esta energía adicional ha calentado la atmósfera, el océano y la tierra, y se han producido cambios rápidos y generalizados en la atmósfera, el océano, la criósfera y la biosfera. Los satélites en órbita terrestre y las nuevas tecnologías han ayudado a los científicos a ver el panorama general, recopilando muchos tipos diferentes de información sobre nuestro planeta y su clima en todo el mundo. Estos datos, recopilados durante muchos años, revelan los signos y patrones de un clima cambiante. Los científicos demostraron la naturaleza de atrapar el calor del dióxido de carbono y otros gases a mediados del siglo XIX.2 Muchos de los instrumentos científicos que usa la NASA para estudiar nuestro clima se enfocan en cómo estos gases afectan el movimiento de radiación infrarroja a través de la atmósfera. A partir de los impactos medidos de los aumentos de estos gases, no hay duda de que el aumento de los niveles de gases de efecto invernadero calienta la Tierra en respuesta. Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático Los núcleos de hielo extraídos de Groenlandia, la Antártida y los glaciares de las montañas tropicales muestran que el clima de la Tierra responde a los cambios en los niveles de gases de efecto invernadero. También se puede encontrar evidencia antigua en anillos de árboles, sedimentos oceánicos, arrecifes de coral y capas de rocas sedimentarias. Esta evidencia antigua, o paleoclima, revela que el calentamiento actual está ocurriendo aproximadamente 10 veces más rápido que la tasa promedio de calentamiento después de una edad de hielo. El dióxido de carbono de las actividades humanas está aumentando unas 250 veces más rápido que el de las fuentes naturales después de la última Edad de Hielo.3 La temperatura promedio de la superficie del planeta ha aumentado aproximadamente 2 grados Fahrenheit (1 grado Celsius) desde finales del siglo XIX, un cambio impulsado en gran medida por el aumento de las emisiones de dióxido de carbono a la atmósfera y otras actividades humanas.4 La mayor parte del calentamiento ocurrió en los últimos 40 años, los siete años más recientes han sido los más cálidos.

    "content": "Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term. Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the mid-20th century are driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the Sun’s energy output, variations in Earth’s orbit). Scientists use observations from the ground, air, and space, along with computer models, to monitor and study past, present, and future climate change. Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss at Earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes. “Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms \"weather\" and \"climate\" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.

La vida en la Tierra depende de la energía proveniente del Sol. Aproximadamente la mitad de la energía luminosa que llega a la atmósfera de la Tierra pasa a través del aire y las nubes hacia la superficie, donde es absorbida e irradiada en forma de calor infrarrojo. Aproximadamente el 90% de este calor es absorbido por los gases de efecto invernadero e irradiado nuevamente, lo que ralentiza la pérdida de calor hacia el espacio.

    "content": "Human activities are driving the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the \"greenhouse effect\"1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space. A vital component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO2) is released through natural processes (like volcanic eruptions) and through human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Like many atmospheric gases, methane comes from both natural and human-caused sources. Methane comes from plant-matter breakdown in wetlands and is also released from landfills and rice farming. Livestock animals emit methane from their digestion and manure. Leaks from fossil fuel production and transportation are another major source of methane, and natural gas is 70% to 90% methane. A potent greenhouse gas produced by farming practices, nitrous oxide is released during commercial and organic fertilizer production and use. Nitrous oxide also comes from burning fossil fuels and burning vegetation and has increased by 18% in the last 100 years. These chemical compounds do not exist in nature – they are entirely of industrial origin. They were used as refrigerants, solvents (a substance that dissolves others), and spray can propellants. FORCING: Something acting upon Earth's climate that causes a change in how energy flows through it (such as long-lasting, heat-trapping gases - also known as greenhouse gases). These gases slow outgoing heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but because the warming ocean increases the amount of it in our atmosphere, it is not a direct cause of climate change.Credit: John Fowler on Unsplash FEEDBACKS: A process where something is either amplified or reduced as time goes on, such as water vapor increasing as Earth warms leading to even more warming. Over the last century, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This increase happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by nearly 50% since",

Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing us today. It involves many dimensions – science, economics, society, politics, and moral and ethical questions – and is a global problem, felt on local scales, that will be around for thousands of years. Carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is the primary driver of recent global warming, lingers in the atmosphere for many thousands of years, and the planet (especially the ocean) takes a while to respond to warming. So even if we stopped emitting all greenhouse gases today, global warming and climate change will continue to affect future generations.

Supersonic flight is faster than the speed of sound and produces a sonic boom, an extreme form of noise pollution. QueSST stands for \"Quiet SuperSonic Technology.\" The X-59 QueSST is testing the technology to fly faster and more efficiently, and to reduce the loudness of a sonic boom reaching land.

In English El cambio climático global no es un problema futuro. Los cambios en el clima de la Tierra provocados por el aumento de las emisiones humanas de gases de efecto invernadero que atrapan el calor ya están teniendo efectos generalizados en el medio ambiente: los glaciares y las capas de hielo se están reduciendo, el hielo de los ríos y lagos se está rompiendo antes, los rangos geográficos de plantas y animales están cambiando y las plantas y los árboles florecen antes. Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático Los efectos que los científicos habían predicho durante mucho tiempo como resultado del cambio climático global ahora están ocurriendo, como la pérdida de hielo marino, el aumento acelerado del nivel del mar y olas de calor más largas e intensas. Algunos cambios (como sequías, incendios forestales y lluvias extremas) están ocurriendo más rápido de lo que los científicos evaluaron previamente. De hecho, según el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (IPCC, por sus siglas en inglés), el organismo de las Naciones Unidas establecido para evaluar la ciencia relacionada con el cambio climático, los seres humanos modernos nunca antes habían visto los cambios observados en nuestro clima global, y algunos de estos cambios son irreversibles en los próximos cientos o miles de años. Los científicos confían mucho en que las temperaturas globales seguirán aumentando durante muchas décadas, principalmente debido a los gases de efecto invernadero producidos por las actividades humanas.

    "content": "As the climate changes, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are increasing. As Earth’s climate changes, it is impacting extreme weather across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe floods, years-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Human actions since the Industrial Revolution, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have caused greenhouse gases to rapidly rise in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases increase, they act as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet. In response, Earth’s air and ocean temperatures warm. This warming affects the water cycle, shifts weather patterns, and melts land ice — all impacts that can make extreme weather worse. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report released in",
