    "date": "2020-11-13T10:30:00-05:00",
    "content": "New homes, offices and restaurants in San Francisco will soon be powered by electricity alone. The city’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday to ban natural gas in new buildings, meaning that stoves, furnaces and water heaters will no longer burn gas for heat. The city cited cost savings, public health benefits and the urgent need to wind down greenhouse gas emissions to help curb the rapidly warming climate for the move. “Natural gas is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in San Francisco and poses major health and safety risks,” tweeted Rafael Mandelman, San Francisco’s District 8 supervisor and the author of the new ordinance. “All-electric construction in new buildings is a critical step toward a safer, healthier San Francisco and planet for future generations.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Burning natural gas not only emits the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but the gas itself—methane—is a short-lived climate super pollutant, capable of warming the planet 87 times more than CO2 when leaked into the atmosphere. San Francisco now joins a growing list of municipalities—most of them in California—that are attempting to tackle the climate crisis by shrinking the massive climate footprint of their buildings. Residential and commercial buildings account for more than 40 percent of San Francisco’s total greenhouse gas emissions, with the burning of natural gas responsible for the bulk of that, according to the city’s estimates. It’s a similar story nationwide. Heating homes and other buildings generates 12 percent of the nation’s total emissions, says the Environmental Protection Agency. And natural gas makes up a large portion of that slice, responsible for nearly 40 percent of the country’s total carbon emissions released each year, or 619 million metric tons of CO2, according to the Energy Information Administration. That’s why San Francisco moving forward with a ban is a big deal, said Amanda Myers, a senior policy analyst for Energy Innovation, a think tank that promotes clean energy. If cities in California continue to rely on gas to heat new buildings through the next decade, Myers said, it will become increasingly difficult—if not impossible—for the state to meet its binding climate target of reaching carbon neutrality by",

    "date": "2020-11-12T10:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "The past few years have brought a widening gap between American oil companies and their European counterparts when it comes to pledging to address global warming. But two recent announcements may signal a change. Occidental Petroleum announced on Tuesday that it will reach net-zero emissions for all the oil and gas it produces by mid-century, becoming the first major American oil company to make such a pledge. The target aligns the company with the position of an incoming Biden administration that has made addressing climate change a central part of its agenda. News of the company’s pledge came just weeks after ConocoPhillips announced a goal of zeroing out its direct greenhouse gas emissions, which are much less than the emissions that come from burning the oil and gas the company sells. Taken together, the two corporate pledges could increase pressure on ExxonMobil and Chevron, the nation’s largest oil companies, which have yet to announce such far-reaching goals. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “It really raises the bar on what is possible in this sector,” said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit that works with investors to pressure companies to reduce their emissions. Before the recent announcements, he said, “we couldn’t go to Exxon or Chevron and say, ‘Hey, Oxy has a net zero target, why couldn’t you?’” Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst with Raymond James, said in an email that Exxon and Chevron are already facing increasing pressure from investors to address a global transition away from oil, and that he’s skeptical that the announcements from Occidental and ConocoPhillips will change much. While Occidental, also known as Oxy, released few details about its plans, the company appears to be relying on the success of technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions or pull the climate-warming gas directly from the air. That strategy would set a different direction from European oil companies that have announced similar emissions reduction goals, but which are expanding businesses into low-carbon sources of energy like wind and solar power. Occidental, instead, seems intent on producing carbon-neutral oil through technologies that have yet to meet much commercial success. Occidental, which has reported losing more than $14 billion this year, is one of the largest operators of so-called “enhanced oil recovery,” a process in which drillers inject carbon dioxide into aging oil fields to squeeze out the last remaining barrels. Some of the gas generally remains trapped in the rock, while the rest can be captured and reinjected. Traditionally, companies have mined most of that CO2 from geological sources, but increasingly they have purchased a portion of their carbon dioxide from industrial plants that are fitted with carbon capture equipment. Occidental’s chief executive, Vicki Hollub, had already used the company’s investment in enhanced oil recovery to say it would one day become a carbon-neutral oil company. On Tuesday, she gave a more specific target, saying during an earnings call that the company would reach “net-zero” emissions for its own operations by",

Biden promoted the technology as a candidate, and it is one of the few climate policies to enjoy true bipartisan support. And while carbon capture and storage, or CCS, has a vexed history, a combination of factors has brought the technology into prominence in recent years. Some climate advocates still see CCS as a pretext for extending the life of fossil fuels, but many scientists and policy experts say it’s growing clearer that the world will need to be able to capture some carbon dioxide emissions from smokestacks or pull CO2 straight from the atmosphere in order to meet global climate goals.

    "content": "The dreams of climate-concerned Americans who had hoped voters would hand Democrats control of the Senate—along with the power to act on a climate agenda—were all but dashed in the election, despite bitterly fought campaigns from Maine to Arizona. Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up three seats. Former astronaut Mark Kelly in Arizona and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper in Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like that script might play out. But then key Republican incumbents held off their Democratic challengers—Sens.

While there were still technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple of seats, they appeared late Wednesday to be long shots at best, leaving some climate activists distraught. “I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,” said Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There is so much work to do.” There was a lot at stake for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfire seasons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires this summer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy. Democrats will still control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change. Experts have said that in a Republican-controlled Senate, there still could be some less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have not so far put forward any comprehensive climate plans. “None of the Republican programs we have seen would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given the science around climate change,” said David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University.

    "date": "2020-10-17T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "The Sierra Club, the oldest and largest environmental organization in the United States, is on a mission it is not known for—shining a light on environmental injustices. It announced its new emphasis during the height of the summer’s racial justice protests triggered by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. With the country in the midst of a racial reckoning, reassessing monuments to Confederate soldiers and other supporters of slavery and racism, it was time, the Sierra Club, announced, “to take down some of our own monuments, starting with some truth-telling about the Sierra Club’s early history.” It denounced its founder, John Muir, for his racist writings, and pledged to diversify its leadership and its environmental campaigns. Ramón Cruz, who was elected president of the Sierra Club in May, is the most visible manifestation of the public commitment to diversity and environmental justice the Sierra Club announced in July. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Cruz, a 44-year-old activist living in Brooklyn, is the first Latino to hold the position in the Sierra Club’s 128-year history. InsideClimate News talked to him about the Sierra Club’s new priorities. What is the significance of the Sierra Club disavowing its founder, John Muir, because he was a racist who made derogatory statements about Black and Indigenous people? I don’t think people should be edified or made holy, when they are just humans with virtues and flaws. I think some people definitely made a lot of contributions, but it doesn’t mean they’re perfect heroes. When talking about our founder, John Muir contributed so much—his writings about the sacredness of nature and the need to protect the environment and nature are so important—but it doesn’t mean that he was a perfect human. I have to understand and reexamine history and learn from it. I wouldn’t want to get rid of John Muir’s contribution, but there are things that you need to put out there to become a more inclusive organization that is more consistent with the values that we profess. In the past, people like me probably wouldn’t be accepted in membership in some of the Sierra Club chapters, as it was done through invitation only. Within the Sierra Club, there have been a lot of people embracing the change toward equity and justice. I came of age in a generation that sees that as essential and intrinsic. Maybe others, not so much. It is a journey for everyone. What is the most urgent issue, or what are the most urgent issues, for the Sierra Club today? Everyone would agree that climate change is the most urgent issue we face because it really encompasses everything in terms of land, water, air, pollution, environmental justice, in terms of how disadvantaged communities are affected the most. We know that fossil fuels are not the future and that fundamental change is needed in an economic system that has been based on the burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution. There are ways of switching—and switching is taking time. In the same way, you still had slavery for many years even after it was obviously immoral and not necessary. It could have been replaced by other ways to continue the economic system. Similarly, there are a lot of people who benefit from this system with money and power. We’ve known already, for over 25 years, that we needed to make a change, that there were already technologies, like wind and solar. But we’ve had people like the current president undermining that change. That said, with an organization as big as The Sierra Club we’re working on many different issues. We had had several campaigns in the past like closing coal plants—even now with how much Trump has been providing life support to the fossil fuel industry, over half the coal plants have closed or are scheduled to close. We see how coal has already turned the page although the president is not giving up. They opened the Arctic wildlife refuge when five of the six major U.S. banks have pledged not to fund these efforts. You mention getting President Trump out of office as part of the Sierra Club’s mission. How is the Sierra Club pitching in this campaign season? Certainly, with weeks left until the election this is the most important election in modern history. We pledged a while back, over a year ago, to dedicate as many resources, energy and people as possible in a way we have never done before to defeat Donald Trump. This has been somewhat changed by Covid-19. The traditional way of organizing—knocking on doors, having rallies—has changed. There have been millions of texts, phone calls and letters that have been done—for six months or more already, we have letter writing parties every week. We’re definitely behind the Biden-Harris ticket and we’re going to do everything we can to get him elected so we can also hold him accountable to stick to a climate minded agenda.

    "content": "Wednesday might have brought the announcement by the federal government that last month was the hottest September on record, but on Thursday night, the words climate change were barely mentioned in dueling town hall events held by President Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Instead, the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and the battle over Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination dominated the questions posed to the presidential candidates during the forums. Trump, who sat facing moderator Savannah Guthrie outside the Perez Art Museum in Miami, did not mention climate change in his answers and was not asked about it. He spent most of the one-hour town hall, hosted by NBC News, defending his administration’s record on combating the pandemic and boosting the economy. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The single question in either forum that touched on the environment was posed to Biden, who shared a small stage with moderator George Stephanopoulos at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia for the hour-and-a-half event, hosted by ABC News. A woman from Pittsburgh stood up to say that fracking had “made people sick and killed wildlife,” and asked the Democratic nominee: “What industries that are not harmful to human health and the environment are you planning for Southwest Pennsylvania and the nation?” Biden replied that he would not ban fracking but instead would regulate it to limit methane emissions and water pollution. He added that his climate plan would create jobs in Pennsylvania and nationally by investing in renewable energy and hiring unemployed oil and gas workers to plug abandoned wells, which can leak methane and oil into the air and groundwater. More jobs would come from funding to make homes and buildings more energy efficient, he said. “Every time we talk about global warming or the environment, the president thinks it’s a joke and I think it’s jobs,” Biden said. Fracking has allowed for a dramatic expansion of natural gas production in Pennsylvania, an important swing state. Trump’s campaign has seized on a statement Biden made before receiving the Democratic nomination—that his administration would allow “no new fracking”—to attack the candidate, claiming his policies would harm Pennsylvania’s economy. More generally, Trump has tried to paint Biden as a radical liberal who wants to end fossil fuel production. Biden has since said repeatedly he would not ban the drilling practice, but has instead proposed limiting drilling on federal lands only. But Biden devoted much of the limited time he spent addressing climate change appealing to centrists and distancing himself from the more progressive wing of his party. In answering the woman from Pittsburgh, he said his administration would invest in carbon capture technology that he said could allow the nation to continue to use natural gas, while also reaching net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon capture and storage has broad support from both political parties, but has come under increasing fire from some climate activists, who say that oil and gas companies are using the technology to deflect efforts to limit fossil fuel use and production. Biden also sought to distinguish his climate plan from the Green New Deal. Stephanopoulos pointed out that Biden’s plan calls the proposal a “crucial framework.” “My deal is a crucial framework, but not the New Green Deal,” Biden replied, transposing the words in the name of the climate plan. “The New Green Deal calls for elimination of all non-renewable energy by",

    "content": "With nearly 300 miles of coastline, the Hawaiian islands that make up Maui County face the threat of sea level rise from all sides. It’s that assault that has formed the foundation of a lawsuit Maui filed this week against 20 fossil fuel companies seeking compensation for the rising costs of climate change. The lawsuit alleges that the companies, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and ConocoPhillips, knew their products produced warming greenhouse gases that threatened the planet but hid those dangers from Maui’s people and businesses to maximize corporate profits. “Defendants have known for more than 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products would have significant adverse impacts on the Earth’s climate and sea levels,” the lawsuit said. “Instead of warning of those known consequences … defendants concealed the dangers, promoted false and misleading information, sought to undermine public support for greenhouse gas regulation, and engaged in massive campaigns to promote the ever-increasing use of their products at ever-greater volumes.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Roadways, parks, infrastructure and buildings that hug the coastline are vulnerable to billions of dollars in damages from sea level rise caused by climate change, the lawsuit said. Some of Maui’s most scenic and iconic highways are at risk, including a stretch of Honoapiilani Highway from Papalaua State Wayside Park to the Pali side of the town of Lahaina. Maui County, which consists of the islands of Maui, Lanai, most of Molokai and two uninhabited islands, already has begun working on a plan for managed retreat and new infrastructure to protect communities from the impacts of rising sea levels. Fossil fuel companies could have taken steps to reduce damage or warn people about the danger from continued use of oil and gas products that harm the environment, the lawsuit said. But now the county wants the industry to take responsibility. “It might be a David vs. Goliath case, but someone has to take a stand and oil companies need to pay for the damage they knowingly caused,” Maui Mayor Michael Victorino said in a prepared statement. “Our ‘rock’ is science, which clearly shows the impacts of burning fossil fuels have led to sea level rise and other environmental impacts that will get worse, perhaps much worse, in the years ahead.” Exxon did not respond to a request for comment. Shell spokesperson Anna Arata said the company supports the transition to a lower-carbon future by lowering both the company’s emission and that of its customers. However, she said in a statement issued in response to previous lawsuits, “We do not believe the courtroom is the right venue to address climate change, but that smart policy from government, supported by inclusive action from all business sectors, including ours, and from civil society, is the appropriate way to reach solutions and drive progress.” Chevron spokesperson Sean Comey also restated the company’s response to previous climate lawsuits, saying the company is “working to find real solutions to climate change.” The climate lawsuits, he said, seek “to punish companies that deliver affordable, reliable energy.” Maui joins a growing list of cities, counties and states that have filed lawsuits seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for damages and mitigation costs attributable to climate change that could severely strain taxpayer-funded budgets.

    "date": "2020-10-09T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "In the biggest case to reach a federal appeals court so far over President Donald Trump’s dismantling of his predecessor’s climate policy, administration attorneys argued on Thursday that the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency only limited authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities. President Barack Obama asserted more expansive powers in his Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of his strategy to combat climate change, which would have cut greenhouse gas emissions by a third. The plan gave states the authority to set emissions goals across the power sector and encouraged them to shift away from coal to cleaner sources of power such as natural gas, wind and solar. It was challenged by industry and 27 states and blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court before Obama even left office. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Trump replaced Obama’s plan last year with something he called the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which was based on a far narrower interpretation of the Clean Air Act and empowered the EPA to seek minor emissions reductions at individual coal-fired power plants. Instead of reducing emissions by a third, greenhouse gases would fall by less than 1 percent. The argument Thursday in the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia came in a lawsuit filed by the American Lung Association and other environmental groups, 20 Democratic states and the District of Columbia to block Trump’s limited approach on grounds that it fails to adequately safeguard public health as the Clean Air Act requires. Jonathan Brightbill, principal deputy assistant attorney general, defended Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy rule, saying Congress only gave the EPA authority to establish standards for power plant operators to achieve greater heat efficiency at individual power plants, thereby reducing emissions. His long and highly technical argument, which at one point came down to a discussion of the differences between “at,” “to” and “for,” seemed far removed from the climate-amplified wildfires that have seared the West Coast or the storms that have pummeled the Gulf Coast. And Brightbill faced tough questioning from the two Obama administration appointees on the three-judge panel, Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard. “I’m a little bit puzzled by the position of the government here,” said Millett. She said that the Clean Power Plan took a flexible, hands-off approach, with the Obama administration saying, “‘This is where we need to go as a country with emissions. We need to protect our country, our resources, our people. Ultimately, you, industry, are the wise ones to figure out how we get there.’ “Why isn’t it the pro-industry, pro-government minimal approach to do it this way?” asked Millett. “It’s more flexible.” “It may very well be that from a policy perspective,” said Brightbill, but that wasn’t the law as Congress wrote it. Judge Justin Walker, the third jurist on the panel and the newest member of the D.C. Circuit, ranged far from statutory language in his questioning. Walker, 38, a Trump appointee and protege of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who was installed on the appeals court last month, at one point asked a lawyer for a group of power companies to walk him through the process of electric generation from the time that “a miner mines a piece of coal” to the time that he turns on a light switch. At another point, he noted how much he was learning about electric grid operators. Walker also quoted from Obama’s",

All the while, he avoided outright rejection of global warming while denying the science on its causes and urgency. On the third attempt by Fox News host Chris Wallace, the debate moderator, to get Trump to answer directly whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming, the president side-stepped, then sought to change focus. “I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes,” Trump said. “I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest.” The science is clear that human activity, primarily emissions of fossil fuels, is the primary driver of the current warming of the planet—which is unprecedented in human history.

Those words are sure to echo through the Senate in the weeks ahead as lawmakers consider President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the U.S. Supreme Court. They are Exhibit A for those who argue that Barrett’s elevation to the high court puts at risk the Supreme Court’s seminal reproductive rights ruling, Roe v. Wade. But advocates of climate action are focused on another landmark ruling they fear is in danger due to the deep stamp Trump is seeking to put on the court before he faces voters this fall. Environmental law scholars believe that with Barrett on the bench, there will be little remaining support on the nation’s highest court for upholding what is arguably its most important environmental ruling—Massachusetts v. the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

    "content": "Near the surface of the ocean, global warming is creating increasingly distinct layers of warm water that stifle seawater circulations critical for regulating climate and sustaining marine life. The sheets of warm water block flows of heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients within the water column, and between the oceans and atmosphere. A new study shows more heat is building up in the upper 600 feet of the ocean than deeper down. That increasingly distinct warm layer on the surface can intensify tropical storms, disrupt fisheries, interfere with the ocean absorption of carbon and deplete oxygen, Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State, said. The intensified layering, called ocean stratification, is happening faster than scientists expected, an international team of researchers reported in the study, published Sept. 28 in the journal Nature Climate Change. And that means the negative impacts will arrive faster and also be greater than expected, said Mann, a co-author of the study. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The research suggests that some of the worst-case global warming scenarios outlined in major international climate reports can’t be ruled out, he said.

    "content": "The world must get to net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century, and can make it happen for a cost that is relatively small in global terms, $1 trillion to $2 trillion per year, a new report has concluded. The report was released this week by the Energy Transitions Commission, a think tank whose members include global industry giants like BP. The report said that electricity should replace fossil fuels across the economy, rather than setting up systems that allow for some emissions that would need to be offset by carbon-removal technologies. Researchers and environmental groups have been saying similar things for years, but the message may be more influential coming from an organization tied to big businesses. “An exercise like this, done with this group of people, has more political heft than if it was a bunch of academics in the basement,” said David Victor, an international relations professor at the University of California San Diego and co-chair of the Brookings Institution’s energy and climate initiative. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The commission has a roster of major players from business and industry, but the list is heavily weighted toward Europe, and includes no large industrial or energy businesses from the United States. European businesses are trying to keep up with their governments on climate policy, while there is less pressure to do so in the United States, Victor said. Adair Turner, the commission’s co-chair, emphasized that the world must focus on cutting emissions and not rely heavily on carbon offsets, saying, “Zero must mean zero.” By taking a hard line on carbon offsets, the commission is going further than some of its members, whose climate plans rely on carbon capture, carbon offsets or other methods that allow for some emissions. The report acknowledges that some differences exist, saying that commission members “endorse the general thrust of the arguments made in this report but should not be taken as agreeing with every finding or recommendation.” The London-based commission is a partnership of about 40 companies and environmental groups, including the steelmaker ArcelorMittal, oil majors like BP and Shell, and businesses that focus on renewable energy like Iberdrola and Ørsted.

    "title": "Changing Patterns of Ocean Salt Levels Give Scientists Clues to Extreme Weather on Land",
    "date": "2020-09-14T20:19:54-04:00",
    "content": "New mapping of salt concentrations in the world’s oceans confirms what physics and climate models have long suggested: Global warming is intensifying Earth’s water cycle, speeding up the rate at which water evaporates in one area and falls as rain or snow somewhere else. That intensification has enormous implications because it worsens droughts and increases extreme rainstorms and flooding. But it has been hard to measure, because data is sparse across vast expanses of the oceans, which cover more than 70 percent of the planet’s surface. A study published Sept. 9 in the Journal of Climate, however, paints a much clearer picture of how much, and exactly where, the water cycle is changing, by tracking how salt concentrations have changed in the oceans over the last 50 years. Those measurements act like a giant rain gauge for the oceans, said co-author Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Trenberth linked the findings to recent extreme wildfires and droughts in California and Australia. “The wildfires keep getting worse as the dry areas get drier,” he said. “This year it’s California, last year it was Australia. As the pattern persists, that’s when the chances increase for the effects to really accumulate and do damage. It’s very easy to say this is weather, this is just one event, but the study shows it’s part of a bigger pattern.” The areas that are getting saltier show where there has been less rain and more evaporation, increasing the salt concentration, while the areas that are getting fresher are those getting more rain, diluting the saltiness. That affects land areas, too, because the storms and weather patterns that form over oceans eventually pass over the continents. Based on the changing concentrations of salt, the researchers estimated that the total amount of water moving through the cycle in the form of evaporation and rain has increased by 2 to 4 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. That is enough to intensify dryness in drought-prone areas like the Southwestern United States and to increase precipitation in areas vulnerable to extreme rain, like the Midwest. In areas where evaporation increases, soils and plants lose more water to the air. But that moisture doesn’t stay in the atmosphere forever. Eventually it falls somewhere else as rain or snow, and the new mapping shows that’s happening in areas that are already wet. Salt concentration, or salinity, is a good measure of how much water is added to and removed from the ocean, said co-author Nicolas Gruber, an environmental physicist at ETH Zürich. “It’s much more a recorder of environmental change than anything else in this context,” he said. “It’s a really good measure of the hydrological cycle, and over the ocean it works really well. It helps us understand the dynamics and the physics of the problem.” The researchers pointed out that, with 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit warming, the point above which calamitous climate conditions are likely, the water cycle will intensify by between 4 and 8 percent, and perhaps more, if industrial air pollution with cooling effects is reduced. The new study details regional changes—including increasing salt concentrations—in parts of the Caribbean and Indian Oceans, indicating less rainfall. The concentration of freshwater is increasing, on the other hand, across the Pacific and in the North Atlantic, where it could disrupt the Gulf Stream and the underlying Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, a critical conveyor belt for global heat all the way from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, said co-author Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State. Knowing where more water evaporates from the ocean can also help show where more rain will fall, so understanding and tracking the regional changes in salt concentration can improve projections for future extreme changes in precipitation. Co-author John Fasullo, with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said the new study provides an important global understanding of changes in salt concentration that will help pinpoint estimates of future regional change. Understanding changes in ocean salt concentration is not only important because of how they affect the climate and weather. There are direct impacts to the ocean, as well, Mann said. “First, ocean organisms are adapted to certain salinities,” he said. “If these start to change, then, along with warming and ocean acidification, it begins to challenge the adaptive capacity of marine organisms and ultimately the ocean food chain, and us.” Salinity also influences seawater density, which determines the distribution of warm and cold layers of water in the ocean. That stratification has an impact on ocean circulation, tropical storms, ocean oxygen levels and nutrients in the upper ocean, Mann added. The study creates a salinity index that “provides a particularly clean, low noise, high signal, means for detecting the climate change signal,” he said. The processes of precipitation and evaporation are speeding up because of human-caused global warming, and “perhaps the biggest impact is on water movement,” added John P. Abraham, an engineer and climate researcher at St. Thomas University in Minnesota, who was a co-author of the study. “Because salty water is heavy, it wants to fall from the ocean surface to the ocean floor, called downwelling water,” he said. “Areas that are becoming less salty are lighter and they tend to stay at the surface. The upward and downward water motions are super important for ocean currents, because it causes nutrients to be brought to the surface for fish, and this regulates the climate around the world.” The changes to precipitation and evaporation, he said, “will change the weather on the planet.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2020-09-02T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Energy regulators in Alabama voted Tuesday to uphold what critics have dubbed a “sun tax” on people who put solar panels on their homes and businesses across much of the state. The Alabama Public Service Commission, which regulates the investor-owned Alabama Power Co., not only rejected a petition by the Southern Environmental Law Center to end the company’s extra monthly fee for customers with their own solar systems, but raised that fee by 8 percent. Alabama Power provides electricity to more than 1.4 million customers across the southern two-thirds of the state, including the cities of Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The Alabama Power solar fee is part of what clean-energy advocates have described as among the most regressive solar power policies in the country. Losing the decision after a two-year legal battle before an administrative law judge and the commission was a blow, said attorney Keith Johnston, who directs the law center’s Alabama office. “It’s very disappointing for the customers of Alabama Power,” Johnston said. It’s not fair to “people who want to use renewable energy, who want to decrease their electric bills” and invest thousands of dollars to do so, he said. Alabama Power, he said, is “clawing back the investment you make,” which amounts to a disincentive for using solar power. Alabama Power welcomed the 3-0 decision by the commission. “We are pleased with the vote, which validates our longstanding position that customers with on-site generation who want backup service from the grid should pay the cost for that service,” said Michael Sznajderman, spokesman for Alabama Power. “If not, other customers would unfairly pay the costs for those individuals and businesses.” The commission’s media office did not return a request for comment. A PSC staff recommendation concluded that Alabama Power had “demonstrated that its back-up power service charges are reasonable in that such charges are based on actual metered data, the company’s most recent cost-of-service study and reasonable modeling techniques.” The utility has been charging a $5 per kilowatt monthly fee. For an average 5-kilowatt rooftop solar system, the fee results in an additional $300 charge per year, or approximately $9,000 over the life of the panels, slashing solar customers’ average savings in half, the law center contends. The new fee will be $5.41 per kilowatt monthly. The fight in Alabama comes as almost every state has been weighing changes to how homes with solar are compensated for electricity they send to the grid, with utilities pushing back against policies that were put in place to provide incentives to generate solar power. The law center filed the case more than two years ago on behalf of the Birmingham environmental group Gasp, the law firm Ragsdale LLC and two private Alabama citizens. Other groups were allowed to support the challenge, including the utility watchdog, Energy Alabama. “What is going on, basically, is the power company does not want competition and small-scale solar, which reduces the amount of energy people buy, threatens them,” said Daniel Tait, chief operations officer of Energy Alabama. “They will bend over backward to make sure it is uneconomical for you to go solar.” Alabama Power offers no incentives for solar power, according to its website. The credit customers get for any excess solar power they generate is at a lower-than-wholesale rate, Tait said. The company’s policies on solar power do not seem consistent with the pledge of Alabama Power’s parent, Southern Company, to offer carbon-neutral electricity by",

    "content": "As a cascade of extreme weather disasters upended life across the nation this week, there was no mention of climate change during the four days of the Republican National Convention. The only party leader to refer to “climate” was President Donald Trump, who boasted about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. Amid devastating California wildfires, one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the Gulf Coast in 50 years and the fallout from an unprecedented “derecho” storm system in Iowa, GOP leaders were silent about the science linking the increased frequency and intensity of such calamities to a warming planet. The party made clear its calculation that voters do not require any more response from the GOP other than allegiance to Trump and his signing of emergency orders, seasoned with invective toward Democrats. Trump himself provided plenty of the latter. “How can Joe Biden claim to be an ‘ally of the light’ when his own party can’t even keep the lights on?” he asked in his acceptance speech, contending that power outages California experienced, related to an extreme heat wave, somehow were connected to Democratic energy policy. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Trump has spent nearly four years dismantling U.S. climate policy, rolling back more than 150 environmental regulations, and opening public lands to oil and gas development. No American president has done more to eliminate environmental protection. But in turning a blind eye to climate change, GOP leaders are ignoring the pleas of some party activists, especially young voters. A majority of Americans say they believe climate should be a top concern for the president and Congress. And polls show that the failure to back environmental protection is a major vulnerability for Republicans heading into November. “The perception that the Republican party does not care about the environment, and the unfortunate continued perception that it doesn’t take climate change seriously as an issue is something that’s going to hurt badly,” said Quillan Robinson, vice president of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), an advocacy group started by young Republicans. ACC, which has been working to make the conservative case for environmental action, urged its followers to use the hashtag #WhatAboutClimate to prod GOP leaders during the convention. Meanwhile, in a speech earlier this week before the conservative Sutherland Institute, Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah) said the future of the party was at risk because of its denial of climate change. “I believe strongly that if Republicans don’t make it an issue, we will lose the upcoming generation of Republicans,” Curtis said. “The upcoming generation will not be patient with us. This is a deal-breaker for them. They’ll leave the Republican Party over this one issue.” In an opinion piece in The Hill this week, Robinson urged Republicans to speak out at the convention about Trump’s signing of the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act earlier this month. By highlighting the bill, which directs $10 billion toward addressing the National Park Service’s deferred maintenance backlog and permanently funds the agency’s Land and Water Conservation Fund, the GOP could have provided a boost to the Senate campaigns of Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana, who played a key role in its passage. Instead, Robinson said, by ignoring the legislation, the GOP left the two candidates more vulnerable to attacks by environmental groups, who oppose Gardner and Daines but supported the Act. He also said he was disappointed that Republicans did not talk about possible alternatives to the Green New Deal to address climate change. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy introduced a package of measures, including energy innovation and a massive tree planting program, earlier this year. But McCarthy did not mention them in his speech this week at the party conclave. Robinson said, though, that a bright spot of the convention was the speech by Madison Cawthorne, a Congressional candidate from North Carolina, who urged fellow Republicans to focus on issues that the party has been ignoring. “To conservatives, I say let’s define what we support and win the argument, in areas like health care and the environment,” said Cawthorne. Cawthorne, 25, would be the youngest member of Congress ever elected if he wins in November. His youth is “indicative of the fact that young people understand how important the environment is,” Robinson said. “Young Republican voters, these are the folks who are knocking on doors, the people who are interning in offices, this is the future of the party, and they want action on these issues and strong leadership.” He added, referring to the chance to address climate and the environment at the convention, “I think it was a huge, missed opportunity.” There was plenty of criticism throughout the week of the Green New Deal, even though Democratic nominee Joe Biden has adopted only portions of the proposal in his $2 trillion clean energy and infrastructure plan. “The Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal,” said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who faces a tough re-election fight in November. “If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars. It would destroy the agriculture industry, not just here in Iowa, but throughout the country.” (The Biden plan does envision a gradual transition to electric vehicles, but in no way addresses animal agriculture, except to incentivize farmers to capture methane, a potent greenhouse gas). Ernst talked about the unprecedented, hurricane-force derecho that roared across Iowa earlier this month, devastating communities and causing billions of dollars of damage to the state’s corn and soy crops. She criticized the media for not paying enough attention to the damage, and then praised Trump for signing an emergency declaration. Vice President Mike Pence also portrayed a federal government that was prepared to act, as Hurricane Laura approached Louisiana’s shore. “Our administration is working closely with authorities in the states that will be impacted and FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm’s way,” he said. “This is a serious storm.” Ivanka Trump did the same, adding expressions of warmth and seeking to convey her father’s concern. “The president will continue to support you every step of the way,” she said. “And just as Americans always do, the nation will come together to help you rebuild your homes, businesses and communities—stronger, and more resilient than ever before.” Robinson said he did not think the GOP needed to talk about a connection between the storms and fires and climate change. But the party, he said, should be talking about plans for addressing climate change. “I’m skeptical of the tendency of some to attribute every natural disaster to climate change, but we do need to appreciate the fact that these natural disasters are exacerbated by the effects of climate change,” he said. “Let’s look at the policies that are going to make our environment more healthy and sustainable but also create economic prosperity.” Nevertheless, Robinson said he feels optimistic that the GOP will eventually embrace climate action, pointing to the large number of Republican candidates his organization has endorsed who are talking about the environment on the campaign trail, if not at the convention.

    "content": "Find profiles of all the presidential election candidates here. In choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden put a spotlight on two key elements of his climate policy: environmental justice for minority communities and accountability for the oil and gas industry. Harris, who will be the first Black woman to run on a major political party’s presidential ticket, only last week sought to affirm her commitment to communities of color in the climate battle—and progressives in the Democratic party—by introducing climate equity legislation. The California Senator teamed up with Green New Deal avatar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on the effort, an outreach to the climate activist community that Biden hopes to energize behind his candidacy. During her presidential run, Harris also frequently advocated for the federal government to take legal action against fossil fuel companies for their legacy of climate pollution. It’s another stance that resonates with many climate-focused voters, even though, as California’s attorney general, she did not go as far as other state law enforcers in pursuing litigation against the industry. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Certainly, many factors beyond climate change will decide Harris’s value to the Democratic ticket, including her ability to win over voters in states beyond California. How she handles critiques of her past work as a prosecutor will be important, especially amid the national reckoning on race and law enforcement, and how well she stands up to President Donald Trump’s attacks will be critical, as well. But the environmental community is an important constituency that analysts believe Biden must activate to put together a winning coalition. He took an important step toward that goal last month with a greatly expanded $2 trillion plan, developed with input from advisers to his primary rival, Bernie Sanders. By bringing another rival, Harris, aboard as vice president, Biden chose a candidate already tested in the campaign spotlight with a record and profile for action on environmental issues that is winning the team praise throughout the activist community. “A true environmental champion,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters, noting that Harris has had a 91 percent pro-environmental lifetime voting record on the LCV scorecard (that’s better than Biden’s lifetime score of 83 percent). “Senator Harris has been a long-time champion for climate action and environmental justice….We know she will continue the fight for a more just solution to the climate crisis.” Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth Action, an environmental group that would like to see Biden’s recently expanded climate platform go even farther, also had praise for the choice of Harris. “Senator Harris’ commitment to environmental justice and her desire to hold corporate polluters financially and criminally accountable for their destructive behavior is a welcome sign,” Pica said. “We hope her inclusion on the ticket provides another opportunity for Vice President Biden to increase the ambition of his climate plan and cements climate justice and climate equity as a priority for their administration.” Harris brings a record on climate issues that dates back to her time as San Francisco’s district attorney, when she created that office’s first environmental justice unit in",

    "date": "2020-08-13T22:34:44-04:00",
    "content": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a long-anticipated rollback of methane emission regulations for the oil and gas industry on Thursday, marking the latest in a long series of attacks on federal climate policy by the Trump administration. The move, which was opposed by several leading oil and gas companies, could result in a catastrophic increase in the release of a climate “super-pollutant,” at a time when global methane emissions from human activity are already rising yet, to limit future warming, they must be quickly reduced. A pre-publication draft of the rules released by the EPA on Thursday would weaken Obama-era rules requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and fix points where methane—the second largest driver of human-made climate change after carbon dioxide—leaks from wells and other infrastructure. The change in rules would result in the release of an additional 4.5 million metric tons of preventable methane pollution each year, according to an assessment by the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is 86 times more effective at warming the atmosphere over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide. The additional release would equal the annual greenhouse gas emissions of about 100 coal fired power plants, nearly one third of all coal-fired power plants in the United States, according to an assessment by EDF. “We are effectively telling the rest of the world we don’t care about climate change,” said Rob Jackson, an earth system science professor at Stanford University. EDF President Fred Krupp said in a written statement on Thursday that the organization planned to sue the Trump administration over the rollback. Reducing methane emissions makes economic sense for oil and gas companies because methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a valuable commodity. Leading oil companies BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil have all urged the Trump administration to maintain strong methane emission regulations. “We need to control methane emissions now to maximize the advantages of gas and secure a role for decarbonized gas in the future energy system,” Joe Ellis, a vice president and head of U.S. government affairs at BP America, wrote in a November",

    "date": "2020-08-06T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "When Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced climate “equity” legislation on Thursday, climate activists saw it as a hopeful sign of Democratic unity less than three months before a hugely consequential election with both the White House and the Senate up for grabs. The two star Democrats first unveiled the Climate Equity Act in draft form more than a year ago, when Harris was running for president. The formal introduction of a new and improved version comes as the California senator is vying to become Joe Biden’s choice as his vice presidential running mate in the race to unseat President Donald Trump, whose failed handling of the coronavirus pandemic has sent his already low approval ratings tumbling. The climate legislation, which has been the subject of extensive community outreach by Harris and Ocasio-Cortez over the last year, would create an Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability within the Office of Management and Budget and require the government to consider the impact of any environmental legislation or regulation on low-income communities. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Natalie Mebane, policy director for the climate activist group 350.org, said that while her organization has not endorsed any candidate as Biden’s running mate, she was hopeful that Harris, if chosen, would espouse expansive policies based on the findings of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, not politically expedient half-measures. Any presidential or vice presidential pick, she said, “should have a really clear plan of how we’re going to phase out fossil fuels” and transition to clean energy in a way that “uplifts the most vulnerable members of society” hurt the most by climate change. Evan Weber, political director of the Sunrise Movement, applauded the partnership between Harris and Ocasio-Cortez and said Harris had shown “she is responsive to activist and movement pressure to make climate a top priority.” With the right people in power, Weber said, “we might make the first down-payments on the national mobilization necessary to confront the climate crisis over the next decade.” Last week, Harris and another Biden vice presidential contender, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, introduced the Environmental Justice For All Act, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency to consider the cumulative effects on air and water pollution before issuing permits in communities already burdened by pollution. Biden’s selection of a running mate, from a short-list that includes Harris, Duckworth, former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Rep. Karen Bass of California, could mend, or fuel, a division between the Democrats’ centrist and progressive wings, and help drive turnout by young voters and voters of color. Biden recently announced a $2 trillion climate plan, which allocates 40 percent of clean energy and infrastructure benefits to historically marginalized communities. Some Democratic progressives have expressed skepticism about Harris’s career as a prosecutor and her flip-flops on Medicare for All during the Democratic primaries. She has also struggled to earn support among Black voters, many of whom flocked to Biden out of concern about her electability and authenticity. Her partnership with Ocasio-Cortez on the issue of climate equity could calm progressives’ nerves and make her an asset to Biden, bringing crucial support from racial and climate justice-focused voters. The Climate Equity Act seems well-designed to meet the demands of the current moment. It seeks to ensure that “no community gets left behind” when it comes to climate policy. “Indigenous communities, Black and brown communities, and the youth of our nation are calling for and demanding justice. We need them at the table from the beginning,” Harris said in an email. “For too long, policies that affect communities of color have been determined by a few white men in a room in Washington,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an email. “I’m proud to partner with Senator Harris on a bill that will pave the way for a new, inclusionary way of doing things in D.C.” Over the past year, their staffs consulted with numerous environmental justice coalitions and organizations, including New York-based WE ACT for Environmental Justice and the national Climate Justice Alliance. Leah Stokes, a political scientist and environmental policy expert, said the bill’s explicit linking of climate to racial justice and equity makes her hopeful for the future of the climate movement. “We can get further if we build a bigger coalition and we make sure benefits flow to communities of color and that’s what this legislation is about,” she said. Stokes said that both Harris and Ocasio-Cortez continue to represent the allies needed by the climate justice movement—“people in positions of power who understand that climate justice is racial justice.” Stokes said that the legislation’s development led to the creation of an equity score, which will be developed by experts and community leaders to account for the environmental and climate equity impacts of legislation and regulations on low-income communities and communities of color. The legislation also addresses calls to redirect capital to historically marginalized communities of color by requiring an examination of the historical recipients of federal grants and loans. It includes a plan to increase such recipients’ diversity in the hopes of making opportunities more accessible. Robert Bullard, a scholar and author widely known as “The Father of Environmental Justice,” said he thought Harris or one of the other Black women under consideration would help Biden’s chances of defeating Trump. Having a Black woman vice president who views climate through the lens of equity and justice, Bullard said, adds value at a moment when people are hungry for “transformative change.” A pure message of reducing emissions can’t meet the current moment, Bullard said. “You don’t get to the White House by just talking about climate,” he said. “It has to be climate and…” “All of these things intersect,” Harris said, “and we must center the fight for environmental and climate justice in the broader conversation. And that’s why this legislation is so important at this moment, which I have said is not just a moment, but a movement.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "The world’s leading oil and gas giants this week revealed the scale of the damage inflicted on the industry by the coronavirus pandemic, with top American companies reporting billions in losses while some European companies were able to eke out small profits. Shell and Total, based in the Netherlands and France, respectively, said a dimming outlook on the long-term demand for oil and gas had forced them to cut the value of their assets by a collective $25 billion. The two companies attributed that lowered outlook to the effects of the pandemic, but also to an accelerating global transition to clean energy ExxonMobil and Chevron, based in Texas and California, reported large losses as a result of the coronavirus, but made no mention of an energy transition or a looming peak in oil demand.

Chevron, for example, announced this month it would increase its oil and gas resources by buying Noble Energy for $5 billion. American and European oil companies appear to be split over the risks posed by a global shift away from fossil fuels, and how the industry needs to adapt, according to the statements. The European companies continue to stress their commitments to increase spending on clean energy, while Exxon touted its investments in carbon capture technology and efforts to reduce methane emissions from its operations. But even European companies that have made net-zero pledges, like BP and Shell, do not include substantial cutbacks in oil and gas development or production in the short-term. “In general, all these net-zero targets for",

    "date": "2020-07-26T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio—Among other things, the king-size bribery scandals in Illinois and Ohio dominating the headlines lately are a vivid illustration of how utilities routinely exert financial and political power to shield themselves from the risks of doing business, often at the expense of consumers. The dynamic is so pervasive that some analysts and advocates say they thought they had lost the ability to be shocked by it—until the revelations of the last 10 days. “I was gobsmacked,” said Ned Hill, an Ohio State University economist who had testified against the legislation now at the center of the bribery probe. The behavior described in legal documents, he said, looks “like the outtakes from The Godfather.” Hill and other close observers of the legislative process say utilities have too much political power and operate in a campaign finance system that makes it too easy for them to get what they want, and that often leads to unfair competition. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. On July 17, federal prosecutors in Illinois announced that the utility Commonwealth Edison had allegedly provided jobs and favors to people associated with the Illinois House speaker, in exchange for legislation that included a bailout of nuclear power plants. Four days later, federal prosecutors in Ohio made a more startling announcement in an unrelated but similar case, charging the Ohio House speaker, Republican Larry Householder, and four other people, with taking more than $60 million from the utility FirstEnergy in exchange for passing a nuclear bailout. The utilities’ unrestrained influence also has implications for climate change and the environment, although those factors differ widely in the Illinois and Ohio cases because of differences in the bills passed in each state. But environmental advocates say both the Illinois and Ohio examples are alarming because they show a system in which all concerns take a back seat to profits of utilities. “When companies like ComEd and FirstEnergy have billions of dollars at stake, spending tens of millions of dollars on campaign contributions, bribes and other activities is sort of a down payment, and that’s sad,” said Howard Learner, president and executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center in Chicago. The Illinois and Ohio scandals touch on hotly contested policy debates about the transition to renewable energy and whether nuclear power, which is carbon-free, is so important to that transition that it needs to be subsidized. But David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that investigates corruption by utilities, said such debates are largely beside the point. The core problem, he said, is something much simpler: Utilities have shown a pattern of trying “to spend money to influence policy in ways that, above all, protect or strengthen their monopolies and grow their profits, agnostic of the climate impacts.” Pomerantz said he thinks that reducing the political power of utilities will be good for renewable energy and the climate in the long run, because renewable energy has public support and is competitive on the market. “If we get the corrupting influence of utility money out of politics, I’ll very happily take my chances with honest policy debates that engage the public, which broadly supports the rapid transition from fossil fuels to clean energy,” he said. The Illinois and Ohio scandals are tied to the ways utility companies have responded to the competition brought on by electricity deregulation. Both states are among the 15 or so that implemented deregulation laws in the late",

    "content": "When Alaska’s all-white Congressional delegation branded opposition to oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Wildlife National Refuge as a form of discrimination last month, they may have hoped to play into a national dialogue about systemic racism—not necessarily to spark it. In a letter to the Federal Reserve on June 16, Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowsi and Rep. Don Young, all Alaska Republicans, called on federal regulators to investigate whether the refusal of several banks to fund Arctic oil and gas projects discriminated against Alaska Natives, depriving them of social and economic benefits. The politicians had previously called the banks’ refusal a discriminatory tactic “against America’s energy sector.” But controversy followed quickly. In the weeks following the letter, Native organizers penned op-eds and climate activists posted on social media, blasting the three members of Congress for what they viewed as a hypocritical and misleading narrative. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Oil and gas advocates have for years maintained that opposition to fossil fuel companies equals “green racism,” and have portrayed the industry as providing economic aid to marginalized communities by supporting economic development, sponsoring local programs and promising reliable and affordable electricity. Some in Indigenous communities also argue in favor of fossil fuel development, given the opportunities it promises. But in Alaska and elsewhere, Indigenous activists concerned about the the future of their communities and the planet are opposing drilling and spearheading a movement to end investment in fossil fuels. The situation is complicated. Many Black and Indigenous communities in the United States, including Alaska Natives, lack opportunities for more environmentally sustainable development because of long histories of social, economic and political marginalization. Those histories are central to the current debate, raising the question of whether an embrace of fossil fuels by some members of these communities reflects a free choice, or one made out of necessity, given the circumstances left by centuries of systemic racism. Among Alaska Natives, one of the organizers of the opposition to fossil fuels is Siqiñiq Maupin, who over a year ago broke from a corporate career in the oil and gas sector and became a vocal opponent of fossil fuel companies’ activity, hoping to combat the claim that such opposition equals racism. Maupin, who is Iñupiaq, wanted to show that, contrary to stereotypes of Alaska Natives as “oil-hungry” and money-seeking, “not all Iñupiat people want drilling.” In",

    "date": "2020-07-16T09:05:00-04:00",
    "content": "Just 110 days before he faces the nation’s voters for the second time, President Donald Trump continued his three-and-a-half-year attack on the nation’s environmental laws on Wednesday by seeking to reign in one of the most important—the statute that requires federal agencies to assess the environmental consequences of their actions. The new rule Trump put forth would shorten review times under the National Environmental Policy Act, establishing a two-year limit for full environmental reviews and a one-year deadline for less detailed assessments of projects ranging from pipelines and freeways to drilling on federal lands. Environmentalists are concerned that the new NEPA rule would also limit those reviews from fully considering the effects of climate change, the biggest environmental threat of all. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Trump unveiled the proposed changes at a UPS hub in Atlanta, walking on stage to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” before announcing that he was “modernizing” NEPA. He recalled his own “years and years” of litigation as a developer and what he described as a “maze-like approval process that costs millions and millions of dollars.” “All of that ends today,” Trump said. It will mean “better roads, bridges and highways for every UPS driver and citizen across our land.” Industries supporting the administration welcomed the promise of a less costly and streamlined environmental review process. But environmental lawyers in academia and with environmental groups predicted that the Trump administration would fail. They said they expected courts will find the new regulations overreaching in part because they erode the law’s requirement that environmental reviews examine indirect and cumulative environmental impacts—for example, how a petroleum pipeline could contribute to global warming. Trump’s action also raises the stakes in the November election. His opponent, Democrat Joe Biden, laid out a $2 trillion plan on Tuesday to address climate change and boost jobs and the economy amid a coronavirus-caused recession. In some ways, Trump’s NEPA maneuver could be seen as a response to Biden’s climate plan, which the president on Wednesday attacked as a job killer. The new NEPA regulations could be swept aside by Democrats if they win the White House and both houses of Congress in November, just as Republicans and President Trump, under the Congressional Review Act, rejected some of the Obama administration’s final-month actions. Among the Trump administration’s actions: the scuttling of the Obama administration’s rule protecting streams near coal mines. “There have long been calls to streamline the NEPA process and specifically shorten the timeline for completing that process,” said Jayni Foley Hein, natural resources director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law. “But the scope of these regulatory revisions far exceeds anything in recent memory.” She said the Trump administration NEPA rule-making could be open to challenge because it goes beyond the scope of the law. “There is a potential conflict between what the statute requires on its face and these new regulations,” she said. “Agencies would be wise to follow the letter of the statute.” Patrick A. Parenteau, professor of law and senior counsel in the Environmental Advocacy Clinic at Vermont Law School, put it more bluntly. The regulations, he said, “won’t survive judicial review, or they will be immediately erased from the books as soon as Biden is in office. This is just a waste of time, except it will provide a lot of business for lawyers.” NEPA was passed in",

    "content": "When the coronavirus pandemic forced classrooms to close this spring, Leticia Garcia’s family in Fairfax County, Virginia, quickly ran short of money. Garcia cleans schools for a living and, with her hours sharply reduced, found herself at home with her two daughters. She cut their cell phone service to keep the water, gas and electricity on. Now, only Garcia and her son, who helps pay the utility bills, have working phones. “It’s a lot when your hours are reduced, but there are certain things you just can’t cut back on,” she said through a translator about her utility expenses. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Garcia is among thousands of people across the country struggling to pay rising and accumulating utility bills as they deal with the ongoing economic fallout of Covid-19 during a summer forecast to be hotter than usual in much of the country. This week meteorologists are predicting temperatures over 100 degrees and widespread dry conditions for the middle of the country that could last into August. A blanket of heat is expected to stretch from California to parts of the Northeast that could ramp up electricity demand and strain the grid. It is a situation that energy policy experts fear will become increasingly common. Rising temperatures and extreme weather due to climate change are predicted to exacerbate energy insecurity and further the need for expanding energy assistance programs. The coronavirus will likely compound both discomfort and financial distress during the heatwave, as many public places where people typically seek air conditioning are closed to prevent the spread of the virus. Even in states that have imposed moratoriums on utility shut-offs during the pandemic, advocates fear the coronavirus could heighten energy insecurity. With pauses on utility shut-offs beginning to lapse in some states, advocates have begun calling for longer-term consumer protections. “We are seeing an unprecedented number of people asking for help,” said Denise Stepto, chief communications officer at Energy Outreach Colorado, a Denver-based nonprofit that helps residents afford their home energy. “It’s also a big issue for people who have recently fallen into unemployment, because they don’t know how to navigate this situation.” During the first few months of the pandemic, the organization launched an energy relief fund that helped people pay their bills and worked with the state to extend Colorado’s Low-income Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program. They quickly saw about a 40 percent increase from this time last year in people reaching out for help. There are significant health risks associated with falling behind on bills and getting disconnected from utilities, said Diana Hernández, an assistant professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, and these risks are amplified by the extreme temperatures caused by climate change. Heat waves are one of the deadliest types of weather-related disasters, according to the World Health Organization, and research published last month suggests they may contribute to more U.S. deaths per year than previously believed. Warmer temperatures can exacerbate preexisting conditions such as heart and respiratory disease, according to the CDC.

    "content": "Centered in the equatorial tropics, Africa is the world’s hottest continent, and millions of people there are facing a growing threat from deadly heat waves. But no one knows how many people have died or been seriously affected in other ways by extreme heat because the impacts have been poorly tracked. Coordinated reporting is lacking and, at the global level, research and tracking of the impacts of climate change are biased toward developed countries, scientists concluded in a new study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Africa is warming faster than the global average, and the lack of data is a roadblock to effective disaster preparation, assessment of vulnerability and planning for climate resilience, said co-author Friederike Otto, acting director of the University of Oxford Environmental Change Institute. She said she noticed the information gap when she reviewed the international disasters database (EM-DAT), for another recent study on extreme weather events in lower income countries.

During the review, Otto said, she thought to herself, “This is strange. There are no heat waves in Africa. This can’t be right. Parts of Africa are hotspots, why are they not in these databases? If there are no records of the extreme heat events, and when we completely ignore the impacts, it will be impossible to adapt adequately.” Co-author Luke Harrington, also with the Environmental Change Institute, said observations from weather stations and climate models show intensifying heat waves in Sub-Saharan Africa. “But these heat waves are not being recorded,” he said. “It’s as if they haven’t happened, but we know they have.” The EM-DAT database includes information on all disasters going back to",

    "date": "2020-07-02T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Two of the world’s largest energy companies have sent their strongest signals yet that the coronavirus pandemic may accelerate a global transition away from oil, and that billions of dollars invested in fossil fuel assets could go to waste. This week, Royal Dutch Shell said it would slash the value of its oil and gas assets by up to $22 billion amid a crash in oil prices. The announcement came two weeks after a similar declaration by BP, saying it would reduce the value of its assets by up to $17.5 billion. Both companies said the accounting moves were a response not only to the coronavirus-driven recession, but also to global efforts to tackle climate change. Some analysts say the global oil and gas industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation and is finally being forced to reckon with a future of dwindling demand for its products. “I think we may look back on this as the turning point, the moment the industry finally started to say that real assets with real dollar figures associated with them are likely to be ‘stranded’”—or left undeveloped—“in a decarbonizing world,” said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a sustainable business advocacy group that has represented major investors in their engagement with oil companies. “This is a huge turnaround from the industry’s previous stance, which had been that no existing assets were likely to be stranded, that there may be risks in the future, but not in the here and now. That acknowledgment, that the risk is real and it’s here in the present, is a really big deal.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. A growing list of major investors and advocacy groups have been pressing oil companies to better disclose and confront the risk that some of their fossil fuel investments may never be developed or may lose substantial value as the world pivots towards a cleaner energy system in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Much of the industry has resisted. ExxonMobil, for example, maintains that its oil and gas reserves face little risk of being stranded. BP said in mid-June that it expects governments will accelerate a transition to low-carbon energy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, and that the two forces together had compelled the company to revise its long-term outlook for oil and gas demand. As a result, BP said, it would need to cut the value of its assets by between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, and that it may never develop some of its prospective projects. Shell had already lowered its long-term outlook at the end of last year. This week, it released a more pessimistic projection for oil demand over the next few years too. The company also said the cuts to its refining asset values would “support the decarbonization of its energy product mix.” The biggest hit to Shell’s books came in its investments in liquefied natural gas, which the company hopes can still play a growing role in global energy needs. Those assets are now worth up to $9 billion less than Shell had hoped, the company said. Both companies announced this year they would aim to eliminate or cancel out their direct greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. Just days after BP’s announcement, Rystad Energy, an industry research and consulting firm, said it was reducing its assessment of the world’s recoverable oil resources in light of the pandemic. The volume of recoverable oil depends not only on what is in the ground but also on the economics of extracting it. The firm said the pandemic would “expedite peak oil demand,” and that some stores of oil in North American shale, Canadian tar sands and Russian and Norwegian Arctic fields are now likely to go undeveloped, given how expensive they are to extract. The write-downs—also called impairments—announced by Shell and BP are accounting measures that indicate a particular asset or investment is not worth as much as executives had once thought. For oil companies, a write-down is generally triggered by lower oil prices and a belief that demand will not be as high as the company had previously assumed. The research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said the price crash of recent months has wiped away $1.6 trillion in its valuation of oil and gas producers, and that the impairments are sending an important signal. “It’s about fundamental change hitting the entire oil and gas sector. Within this write down, Shell is giving us a message about stranded assets, just like BP did a few weeks ago,” said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis, in a research note. “Just a few years ago, few within the oil and gas industry would even countenance ideas of climate risk, peak demand, stranded assets, liquidation business models and so on. Today, companies are building strategies around these ideas.” The announcements from the European companies are deepening the gulf between them and their American peers, none of which has yet announced an impairment of the same scale tied to the pandemic. That may be due in part to different accounting rules in the United States, but Exxon and other U.S.-based companies also generally have indicated they believe global oil demand is likely to continue to grow for many years, a position that’s drawing scrutiny from a number of large investors such as pension funds. In May, Exxon announced $2.9 billion in write-downs that the company attributed to lower oil prices. “I think thoughtful companies like BP and Shell see they’re in a race against time and that peak demand for oil and gas is coming. The question is just exactly when does it happen,” said Logan. “There’s a growing sense among some companies and certainly investors that assets they thought were safe are going to end up devalued because Covid came when it did at this point, where demand is approaching a peak.” Some analysts have said the companies may be using the pandemic and energy transition as an excuse to shift blame away from bad investment decisions in recent years. Shell, for example, spent $53 billion to acquire the natural gas company BG Group in",

    "date": "2020-06-26T15:49:42-04:00",
    "content": "Along the northern edge of Alaska, millions of square miles of land are home to countless animal species—hundreds of thousands of caribou, scores of threatened bird species, polar bears and more. This isn’t the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, although the same is true there. It’s the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a few hundred miles west of the refuge, and some of its most ecologically sensitive lands may soon be open for business to the oil industry. Since early in the Trump administration, the U.S. Interior Department has sought to open new areas of the NPR-A to drilling, including the area around Teshekpuk Lake, a region that has long been considered too ecologically sensitive for drilling. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “Teshekpuk Lake is the feeding and calving grounds of our caribou, geese, fish we depend on for survival,” said Martha Itta, the tribal administrator of the Native Village of Nuiqsut, which is adjacent to the reserve. “Drilling in the Teshekpuk area would be devastating to our people. We will no longer be able to hunt being surrounded by industry. We will go hungry.” Earlier this year, the Trump administration released a plan for drilling in part of the Alaskan Arctic that provided a range of options. A few of them expanded the area allowed for drilling, but only slightly. One, called Alternative D, opened up almost all of the region—including Teshekpuk Lake. On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management released its final environmental review and announced which option it preferred: Alternative D, plus 300,000 acres. The plan would make a total of roughly 6.8 million acres of previously protected land available for drilling. “They have created a whole new alternative that actually opens more area to oil and gas leasing and exploration,” said Rebecca Noblin, a senior attorney for Earthjustice who specializes in the region. “It’s surprising that they would consider an alternative that wasn’t considered in the draft and that the public didn’t get a chance to comment on.” The new plan contains features of the earlier options that had been presented in the draft review, but has some “minor variations resulting from stakeholder consultation,” according to Lesli Ellis-Wouters, the spokesperson for the Bureau of Land Management in Alaska. “The alternatives analyzed in the Final IAP/EIS allow for an environmentally responsible approach to leasing and development, respect traditional uses of the land, and maintain access to subsistence resources,” she said. Now that the plan has been published, the Interior Department must wait at least 30 days before taking the next step—the publication of what’s called the Record of Decision. After that, the department can schedule a lease sale. The publication of the review represents the next step in the Trump administration’s plans to open up more of the Arctic to drilling. In the Arctic Refuge, progress has been stymied by low oil prices and a lack of clarity about whether companies are interested in investing there. But in the NPR-A, the administration has been steadily plodding ahead, buoyed by reports of vast oil reserves in the area and existing infrastructure at Conoco-Phillips’ nearby projects. “President Trump has committed to expand access to our Nation’s great energy potential,” said Secretary David Bernhardt in a statement Thursday. “Today’s action is one more significant step in the process of delivering on his promise.” Teshekpuk Lake is a prime piece of real-estate.The area provides critical habitat for tens of thousands of birds—many of them threatened with extinction—as well as a 40,000-head caribou herd. But below the surface of the picturesque lake and wetlands petroleum, companies expect to find vast stores of oil. “This plan turns its back on unique and spectacular Arctic wildlife species and sells their key habitat out to the oil industry,” said Nicole Whittington-Evans, the Alaska program director for Defenders of Wildlife. “It gives away critical habitat for imperiled polar bears and vital habitat for caribou and migratory birds to oil companies that will only exacerbate the climate crisis by expanding into a fragile frontier area with new drilling. It is bad for the Western Arctic and bad for the planet.” When the federal government wants to make a plan for drilling in an area—as opposed to planning for one specific project—it works up a science-based document called an Integrated Activity Plan. The plans can span hundreds of pages, and are the result of the work of scores of scientists, policymakers and local stakeholders. In",

The plant is part of a planned plastics expansion in the United States that’s facing fierce opposition from grassroots activists, environmentalists and members of Congress. An analysis by ProPublica found the complex could more than triple the level of cancer-causing chemicals that residents of St. James are exposed to. It also found that the area around the site is already more saturated with those toxins than more than 99 percent of industrialized areas in the country. The Louisiana Bucket Brigade is an environmental nonprofit with a goal of ending petrochemical pollution in Louisiana.

    "date": "2020-06-20T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "When Chevron tweeted “black lives matter” on June 5, the multinational U.S. energy corporation evoked a visceral reaction from many climate activists. “Your performative solidarity with the Black community is an absolute joke,” Communities for a Better Environment, a California-based environmental justice organization, responded. “You should be ashamed of yourself for killing, poisoning and ruining the health and lives of Black people all over the world.” Chevron’s tweet referred readers to a statement from the company’s leadership that was released amidst international protests over the killing of George Floyd on May 25 by a Minneapolis police officer. “As the human energy company, we are just that—humans, and we’ve felt the impact of what is happening in the United States around racial injustice,” the statement says. “Our company is rooted in a diverse and inclusive culture, but we also understand it is our time to listen and learn.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The statement goes on to quote a number of senior executives, including CEO Mike Wirth: “I share the anger and pain felt by so many Americans at the recent killings of unarmed black men and women. Racism and brutality have no place in America. Yet these incidents still occur. And they impact people well beyond those directly affected by such tragedies. Including people at our company. I absolutely believe we are stronger when we embrace our differences, and now is an important time to do just that.” Though Chevron was not the only oil industry heavyweight to issue a statement declaring its commitment to combating racism, the Chevron tweet was shared far more widely than one from BP, which linked to a letter by CEO Bernard Looney that condemned “racial injustice in all its forms.” By contrast, Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil have remained silent on the issue. In response to the criticism, Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said its executives’ official statements spoke for themselves. “Diversity and inclusion are foundational to The Chevron Way,” said Vice President of Corporate Affairs Dale Walsh, who called on all employees to take action “in the ugly face of racism, discrimination and injustice.” Chevron’s website says that it is “committed to fostering diversity and inclusion at all levels of our company,” including by providing opportunities for diversity training to employees and hosting more than 15 “diversity councils” to support its “strategic approach to diversity.” Doria Robinson, a third-generation African American resident of Richmond, California, who has spoken out against the pollution of Chevron’s Richmond refinery, said silence is better than professing values a company’s actions don’t support. Robinson said that the Richmond refinery has a long history of polluting the air breathed by Richmond’s predominantly low-income residents of color, while providing them with limited employment opportunities. She said the refinery has leveraged its financial power to steer local politics in its favor and provided meager community investments in return. Chevron spokesman Tyler Kruzich responded that the company’s leaders are “proud of our ongoing partnership with the community.” He said Chevron is working to help Richmond “prosper by providing ever-cleaner products, good jobs, significant economic output, and community support” and is “committed to investing in Richmond.” Chevron’s definition of supporting racial justice differs dramatically from that of many climate and racial justice activists like Robinson, who see the company’s promises of racial diversity in hiring and rhetorical solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement as hollow. For these activists, Chevron’s core business model—predicated on the burning of fossil fuels, which inevitably hits marginalized communities hardest—is incompatible with meaningful measures of racial or environmental justice. Simply hiring minority employees cannot correct those inequities, they said. Seeking more radical change, they have called on Chevron to make reparations for the harms it has inflicted on poor communities of color worldwide and to prevent future harms by altering its operations. Some even call for the company’s end to help transition toward a more just and sustainable energy system. Other prominent civil rights leaders said they were more focused on the commitments Chevron and other oil companies have made in regard to the racial makeup of their employees. The civil rights leaders view the renewed public focus on racial justice following the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to push the oil and gas industry to ensure its workforce represents, in Rev. Jesse Jackson’s words, “the rich diversity of America,” including in its top ranks. In response to Chevron’s statement, many climate activists invoked the disproportionate impact of fossil fuel pollution and the climate crisis on people of color worldwide, and specifically in the U.S., where Black people’s health is more likely to be threatened by air pollution from the production and burning of oil, gas and coal.

    "date": "2020-06-13T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards on Friday vetoed a bill that would have stiffened penalties for trespassing on pipelines, levees and a long list of other facilities in the state. The veto handed a victory to civil liberties advocates and local organizers, who said the bill would have trampled on their right to protest industrial development. The legislation would have imposed a mandatory minimum three-year sentence for stepping onto “critical infrastructure” during a state of emergency and expanded the list of what falls under that definition, to include flood control structures, which criss-cross the state. Advocates said the bill would have extended the reach of an already vague law that imposes harsh penalties for trespassing on oil and gas industry land and other sites. They argued that the law would intimidate activists who have fought pipelines and chemical plants across the state, by threatening prison sentences for minor infractions. In St. James Parish, west of New Orleans, residents who have been fighting a planned petrochemical complex had regularly stepped onto a levee adjacent to the site, an action that could have qualified as a felony punishable by a minimum sentence had the law gone into effect. “I’m filled with joy,” said Sharon Lavigne, a St. James resident who has led the opposition to the chemical plant, saying she felt like a weight had been lifted off her chest. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The bill’s author, Rep. Jerome Zeringue, a Republican, said he introduced the bill on behalf of the Association of Levee Boards of Louisiana, and that he did not speak with any energy or chemical companies about the legislation. But the bill did draw support from Robert Baumann, a lobbyist who represents oil and gas and pipeline companies. Baumann did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Edwards, a Democrat, said he supported the intent to protect water control structures, but that the bill’s wording would have included levees used for recreation. He also said that because Louisiana “is in a constant state of emergency, there would likely never be a time when the lesser penalty is in effect.” Under current law, trespassing on critical infrastructure carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. The bill had passed with enough votes in both houses of the State Legislature to override the governor’s veto, a chance lawmakers will have later this year. Zeringue said that while he would consider an override, “I feel it would be better for everyone if we just clarify” the bill next session. Last year, Lavigne and other activists discovered that the company behind the planned petrochemical plant, Formosa Plastics, had learned of a burial site on the property that may contain the remains of slaves. Lavigne’s family has been in St. James for as long as she knows, and she considers the people buried there to be her ancestors, so she and others in her group had been visiting the site to lay flowers until Formosa told her she was trespassing. Because a pipeline happens to run under the area, the site could be considered critical infrastructure under state law. Lavigne and her organization, RISE St. James, are planning to hold a ceremony at the burial site to celebrate Juneteenth, the holiday on June 19 that commemorates the end of slavery. Their lawyer sent a letter to Formosa’s lawyer asking for access. They have not gotten a response yet. “We still have plans to go out there,” Lavigne said. “Because it’s our right to visit the gravesite that just happens to be on their property.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "When New York Communities for Change helped lead a demonstration of 500 on Monday in Brooklyn to protest George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis, the grassroots group’s activism spoke to a long-standing link between police violence against African Americans and environmental justice. Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, Brooklyn’s oldest Latino community-based organization, said she considers showing up to fight police brutality and racial violence integral to her climate change activism. Bronx Climate Justice North, another grassroots group, says on its website: “Without a focus on correcting injustice, work on climate change addresses only symptoms, and not root causes.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. These community organizations in New York have been joined in protest by the nation’s most prominent climate change activist groups, including the Sierra Club, 350.org, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion. “NRDC has a responsibility to be fully and visibly committed to the fight against systemic racism and for justice, equity and hope,” Gina McCarthy, its president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “We have marched to the Lincoln Memorial,” Friends of the Earth tweeted Tuesday night, “where we are joining thousands of peaceful protesters sitting and standing face-to-face with law enforcement. #BlackLivesMatter” While some established, and predominantly white, climate and environmental organizations have struggled with diversity in their ranks and faced criticism for being disconnected from communities of color, there are clear signs that they are becoming increasingly focused on racial and environmental justice. The Rev. Fletcher Harper, an Episcopal priest who is executive director of GreenFaith, a global religious-based climate action network based in Highland Park, New Jersey posted on his blog: “For too long, the environmental movement has not been concerned enough about the destruction that climate change wreaks on Black and Brown communities around the world. For too long, we haven’t been concerned enough about Black and Brown people who can’t breathe because they are carrying the weight of climate change and White supremacy.” Patrick Houston, climate and inequality campaigns organizer for New York Communities for Change, said he believes the broader climate movement is “becoming much more open to listening and understanding the struggles of the black community” by connecting “overt racism and violence” with “overlooked racism” stemming from proximity to power plants and other fossil fuel infrastructure. This new show of solidarity, he said, reflects “a work in progress that must continue.” Yeampierre, who is also co-chair of the national Climate Justice Alliance, shares Houston’s hope and skepticism. Given what she considers a historically “extractive” use of the climate justice narrative by “big green” organizations, she said those groups must take direction from Black Lives Matter organizers in protesting Floyd’s killing. Alexandria Villaseñor, the 15-year-old climate activist who is co-founder of the U.S. Youth Climate Strike and founder of Earth Uprising, emphatically agreed. “I think that true solidarity is giving Black Lives Matter organizers platforms, donations and putting our bodies out there on the streets with them,” she said. “We know that there is no climate justice without racial justice. The exploitation of black people is the greatest extractive system of production of all time and in order to heal the planet, we must have black and indigenous liberation.” While both environmental racism and police brutality have long histories in the United States and in New York City—Floyd’s death comes six years after the killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, in a chokehold by a white police officer in",

    "content": "The same economic forces that are delaying construction of a plastics plant in Ohio will make another one under construction in western Pennsylvania less profitable and riskier to shareholders, an economic think tank warns in a new report. The massive, multibillion-dollar Shell Polymers plant rising from the banks of the Ohio River in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, is expected to make 1.6 million metric tons of plastic pellets annually—the building blocks for such products as bags, bottles, food packaging and toys. But a new study from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that Shell will be making less plastic and less money while facing increasingly stiff competition. That means the company won’t likely be able to hire as many workers and will contribute less to the local economy, IEEFA concludes. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. One key factor: the price of plastics has fallen 40 percent since the plant was planned several years ago, as a global petrochemical industry has raced to boost production capacity. These changing economics, made worse by fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, will have significant implications for Shell’s investors, local and state governments in Pennsylvania, and the people of Pennsylvania, who have supported the project through tax breaks. IEEFA, a non-profit whose work is aimed at supporting a sustainable energy economy, called on Shell to be transparent with its investors and the public as economic conditions have changed. “It will be a distressed asset for years to come,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the energy institute. “Only increased public disclosure by Shell can ensure that problems are faced squarely and with common sense.” A Shell spokesman, Curtis Smith, acknowledged “the short-term outlook for this business is challenging given global macro conditions, but it remains our view that long-term demand for the wide variety of products derived from petrochemicals will continue to grow and provide attractive returns.” He said the plant, about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, is still on track to start production “in the early",

    "date": "2020-05-19T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "As the deadline approached for public comment on a controversial “transparency” rule proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, 39 top scientific organizations and academic institutions joined together on Monday to warn that if finalized, the regulation would greatly diminish the role of science in decisions affecting the environment and the health of Americans. In a letter submitted to the EPA, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest scientific society, and a wide array of other professional groups and universities, strongly opposed the rule, which they said is “not about strengthening science, but about undermining the ability of the EPA to use the best available science in setting policies and regulations.” The groups signing the letter included organizations as diverse as the American Psychological Association and the Crop Science Society of America, and universities from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the University of California, Los Angeles. The letter was part of an outpouring of opposition on the last day for public comment on the proposed rule, called “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science.” The rule would restrict the EPA’s use of scientific studies relying on health data that excludes names or other identifying information to protect patients’ confidentiality or that are not “capable of being substantially reproduced.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Critics say the regulation will knock out from consideration some of the most important human health research, while giving industry opponents of environmental protection rules a new avenue to challenge the agency’s actions, even after President Donald J. Trump leaves the White House. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who has vowed to finalize the rule this year, has characterized the plan as a “good government” effort that will increase public confidence in the agency’s decisions. “I fundamentally believe in Community Right to Know and the American public has the right to know what scientific studies underline the Agency’s regulatory decisions,” Wheeler said in a statement last month, thanking the agency’s Science Advisory Board for “their support of the concept of the proposed rule.” In fact, the 44-member board, made up of outside advisers, most of whom were appointed during the Trump administration, has expressed reservations about the proposed “transparency” rule. “There is minimal justification provided in the Proposed Rule for why existing procedures and norms utilized across the U.S. scientific community, including the federal government, are inadequate,” the board wrote in a report to Wheeler last month, referring to practices like peer review that are routinely used by scientific journals and have long been in use at the EPA. “Moving forward with altered transparency requirements beyond those already in use, in the absence of such a robust analysis, risks serious and perverse outcomes,” the advisory board added. The idea of challenging EPA science as lacking in “transparency” dates back more than 25 years to a strategy developed by tobacco and fossil fuel industry advisers to fight national air quality standards on particulate matter pollution produced by combustion. Industry advisers took an approach of raising doubts about the original scientific studies on the grave health risks of so-called PM 2.5. The EPA eventually set fine particle pollution standards, but the fight over the science never quieted, in large part because a wide range of regulations affecting the fossil fuel industry, including those seeking to address climate change, have been based on that science. When Republicans were in control of Congress, the House three times passed legislation to rein in the EPA’s use of science, but the bills were never taken up by the Senate. The Trump administration picked up the idea, and received 600,000 comments when the new rule was first proposed in",

    "content": "The developers of a proposed plastics manufacturing plant in Ohio on Friday indefinitely delayed a final decision on whether to proceed, citing economic uncertainties around the coronavirus pandemic. Their announcement was a blow to the Trump administration and local economic development officials, who envision a petrochemical hub along the Ohio River in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Environmental activists have opposed what they say would be heavily polluting installations and say bringing the petrochemical industry to this part of Appalachia is the wrong move for a region befouled for years by coal and steel. Thailand’s PTT Global Chemical America and South Korea’s Daelim Industrial have been planning major investments in the $5.7 billion plant, 60 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, for several years.

On the site of a former coal-fired power plant, the facility would have turned abundant ethane from fracking in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions into ethylene and polyethylene, which are basic building blocks for all sorts of plastic products. The partnership had promised a final investment decision by summer, but announced the delay in a statement on its website. “Due to circumstances beyond our control related to the pandemic, we are unable to promise a firm timeline for a final investment decision,” the companies said. “We pledge that we will do everything within our control to make an announcement as soon as we possibly can with the goal of bringing jobs and prosperity to the Ohio Valley.” In March, financial analysts with IHS Markit, a global information and data company, and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a nonprofit think tank, agreed the project was in trouble even before the coronavirus began to shrink the global economy. A global backlash against plastics, low prices and an oversupply of polyethylene, were all signs of troubling economic headwinds before Covid-19 sent world oil prices tumbling, disrupting the petrochemicals industry. JobsOhio, the state’s private economic development corporation, has invested nearly $70 million in the project, including for site cleanup and preparation, saying thousands of jobs were in the offing. A JobsOhio spokesman declined to comment Friday. “It’s good news,” said project opponent Bev Reed, a community organizer with Concerned Ohio River Residents and the Buckeye Environmental Network. The delay, she said, “gives us more time to educate and organize and it gives us an opening to create the economy we want.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2020-04-21T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Tribal leaders from across the country are calling for the U.S. Departments of Interior and Treasury to halt a proposed plan that could give as much as half of $8 billion in emergency relief funds earmarked for the nation’s tribal governments to private Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs). The corporations collectively generate more than $10 billion in revenue from a diverse array of industries, including significant oil and gas developments. Six tribes, including three from Alaska, filed suit against Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. to halt the transfer of funds. The suit noted that Alaska’s more than 200 regional and village corporations are private, for-profit businesses. The state’s 12 regional ANCs own “scores” of corporate subsidiaries operating in all 50 states, as well as foreign countries, and are not tribal governments, according to the suit. The complaint noted that their business holdings include construction, pipeline maintenance, government and military contracting, financial management and aerospace engineering firms. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, the largest ANC, earns nearly half of its $3.4 billion in annual revenue from the oil and gas sector, including company-owned refineries and royalties from North Slope oil and gas leases. The proposed plan for distributing money under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act would keep funding from tribal groups, “who are in dire need of the funds to support the necessary and increased expenditures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the tribes said. They include Alaska’s Akiak Native Community, the Asa’carsarmiut Tribe and the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island. At a time when trillions of federal dollars are being spent to staunch the economic impacts of Covid-19, tribes worry they could be losing sorely needed aid to privately-held corporations with ties to the oil industry. Leaders of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe of South Dakota say they also plan to file suit against the Treasury and Interior Departments if the distribution of funds to the ANCs goes forward. While the exact funding formula hasn’t been released, the Interior Department has requested that tribes and ANCs provide data on the size of their land holdings, and the number of their members or shareholders. The 45 million acres held by the 12 regional Alaska Native Corporations nearly equals that of the country’s 574 federally recognized tribes. Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe officials say disbursements based on land holdings could result in $3 to $4 billion going to the corporations. “To put it in terms of geography, Sweeney is trying to slip in 45 million acres of Alaska fee lands owned by ANC corporations, which are not Indian Country,” Rodney Bordeaux, president of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, wrote in an April 14 letter to Secretaries Mnuchin and Bernhardt. “In contrast, in the lower 48, there are 55 million acres of Indian country, and she is excluding millions of acres of Indian reservation and allotted trust land… There is no sense to it.” The ANCs were created in",

    "content": "The American West is well on its way into one of the worst megadroughts on record, a new study warns, a dry period that could last for centuries and spread from Oregon and Montana, through the Four Corners and into West Texas and northern Mexico. Several other megadroughts, generally defined as dry periods that last 20 years or more, have been documented in the West going back to about 800 A.D. In the study, the researchers, using an extensive tree-ring history, compared recent climate data with conditions during the historic megadroughts. They found that in this century, global warming is tipping the climate scale toward an unwelcome rerun, with dry conditions persisting far longer than at any other time since Europeans colonized and developed the region. The study was published online Thursday and appears in the April 17 issue of the journal Science. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Human-caused global warming is responsible for about half the severity of the emerging megadrought in western North America, said Jason Smerdon, a Columbia University climate researcher and a co-author of the new research. “What we’ve identified as the culprit is the increased drying from the warming. The reality is that the drying from global warming is going to continue,” he said. “We’re on a trajectory in keeping with the worst megadroughts of the past millennia.” The ancient droughts in the West were caused by natural climate cycles that shifted the path of snow and rainstorms. But human-caused global warming is responsible for about 47 percent of the severity of the 21st century drought by sucking moisture out of the soil and plants, the study found. The regional drought caused by global warming is plain to see throughout the West in the United States. River flows are dwindling, reservoirs holding years worth of water supplies for cities and farms have emptied faster than a bathtub through an open drain, bugs and fires have destroyed millions of acres of forests, and dangerous dust storms are on the rise. A similar scenario is unfolding in South America, especially in central Chile, a region with a climate similar to that in western North America. Parts of the Andes Mountains and foothills down to the coast have been parched by an unprecedented 10-year dry spell that has cut some river flows by up to 80 percent. In both areas, research shows, global warming could make the droughts worse than any in at least several thousand years, drying up the ground and shifting regional weather patterns toward drier conditions. This is bad news for modern civilizations that have developed in the last 500 years, during which they enjoyed an unusually stable and wet climate. And assumptions about water availability based on that era are not realistic, said climate scientist Edward Cook, another co-author on the study who is also with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The impacts of a long-lasting drought in the West could also affect adjacent regions. A",

    "content": "Sweeping aside a broad body of evidence that air pollution is killing as many as 52,100 Americans prematurely each year, the Trump administration on Tuesday rejected government scientists’ recommendation that it strengthen the national air quality standard for fine soot. The proposal to maintain the current standard for PM 2.5—microscopic particles known as fine particulate matter—in the face of alarming new science documenting its potentially deadly health effects, is a win for the fossil fuel industry. It comes amid a frenzy of major decision-making at the Environmental Protection Agency that critics say is designed to secure the Trump administration’s pro-industry legacy in the face of an uncertain future. Any decisions that the EPA makes past roughly May 20 could be summarily reversed by the next Congress if Democrats were to retake the White House and Senate in November’s election. It’s not clear if the PM 2.5 decision will make the deadline—there will be a 60-day public comment period after the plan is published in the Federal Register. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The Trump EPA has raced to loosen or reject a slew of clean air protections, even as the nation has been brought to a virtual standstill by a highly contagious virus that can produce serious or even fatal respiratory symptoms. In the last month, the Trump EPA has weakened fuel economy standards, advanced a proposal to discount the findings of scientific studies on health in rulemaking and announced a blanket suspension of the enforcement of environmental laws. The decision to maintain the status quo on PM 2.5 was especially striking in the context of the pandemic, and came just days after Harvard researchers released preliminary results of a study showing that U.S. counties with high PM 2.5 levels have higher coronavirus death rates. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, dismissed that study, saying it had not yet been peer reviewed and published. But he also decided to give little weight to eight large epidemiological studies published over the last seven years, all of which were peer-reviewed and indicated that the current PM 2.5 standard was inadequate. EPA staff scientists cited those studies in a January policy assessment that recommended a stronger standard, which they calculated it would save lives.

She has helped organize protests against the local climate denial powerhouse, Koch Industries, as well as a push for a city-appointed task force aimed at cutting plastic bag pollution. But from all the discussion in her network of fellow-minded activists and all the news coverage she watches, she said, she has no clue where former Vice President Joe Biden stands on climate. “All I’ve seen is the debate where he did say he was going to stop fracking, which I thought was kind of odd, since he hasn’t spoken out about that before,” she said in a telephone interview shortly before Sanders’ withdrawal from the race. “How serious is Biden?

As some key species go extinct, entire ecosystems like coral reefs and forests will crumble, and some will collapse abruptly, starting as soon as this decade, a new study in the journal Nature warns. Many scientists see recent climate-related mass die-offs, including the coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef and widespread seabird and marine mammal mortality in the Northeastern Pacific linked to a marine heat wave, as warning signs of impending biodiversity collapse, said lead author Alex Pigot, a biodiversity researcher at University College, London. The new study shows that nowhere on Earth will escape the impacts. “In the U.S., the southern states from Texas to Florida, the Appalachians and the West Coast are projected to be at particularly high risk, with between 20 and 40 percent of species facing conditions beyond anything they have previously experienced,” Pigot said.

In those regions many species live in small geographic areas under a narrow range of climatic conditions. As global warming heats their habitat to the point that it is intolerable, many species have no place to go. Some will go extinct, with a domino effect that affects scores of other species. If it gets too hot for bumblebees, for example, it affects the reproduction of plants. If it gets too warm for insects and reptiles, it affects food supplies for birds and mammals. “I hope our predictions are wrong. But increasingly, what we’re observing around us are the signs of this happening,” Pigot said, referring to research showing how global warming affects individual species. “I think these studies are showing that many species are already living very near their thermal limits. Our results suggest that these losses are likely to involve multiple species near simultaneously rather than happening gradually, one species at a time,” he said.

That single statistic—especially jarring just days after the COVID-19 crisis caused the biggest spike in jobless claims in U.S. history—captures why the auto industry isn’t exactly celebrating the Trump administration’s most consequential retreat yet from climate action. Instead, the industry’s leading trade group responded cautiously that it would review the decision, adding that transformation to address climate change is inevitable. “Looking to the future, we need policies that support a customer-friendly shift toward… electrified and other highly efficient technologies,” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said in a statement. For the Trump administration, though, the trade-offs of aiding such a transition weren’t worth it, even if it meant more jobs. The analysis by Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded that with more stringent standards forcing added production of fuel-saving electric and hybrid technology vehicles, there would have been a need for more workers—or higher “net labor utilization.”. But the proposed loosening of standards, resulting in a 1 percent reduction in annual employment, could save the automakers $15 billion, the agencies said. That money “can be invested by manufacturers into other areas, or passed on to consumers,” the agencies concluded. They justified the move on the basis that it would result in cheaper and safer vehicles, although the EPA’s own Science Advisory Board identified significant weaknesses in that analysis, and the conclusion runs counter to the findings of a National Academies of Science study in",

    "date": "2020-03-27T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Along with temporarily reducing greenhouse gas emissions and forcing climate activists to rethink how to sustain a movement built on street protests, the global response to the coronavirus pandemic is also disrupting climate science. Many research missions and conferences scheduled for the next few months have been canceled, while the work of scientists already in the field has been complicated by travel restrictions, quarantines and other efforts to protect field researchers and remote indigenous populations from the pandemic. The field research season in Greenland and the Arctic, which normally starts ramping up this time of year, has been particularly hard hit. Last week, leaders of MOSAiC, the largest polar research expedition in history, were forced to cancel research flights scheduled for the coming month after Norway imposed travel restrictions that could have quarantined the flights’ crews and prevented them from using airfields in the Arctic islands of Svalbard. Border closures are also hindering scheduled rotations of scientists on and off the expedition’s centerpiece, a research icebreaker that has been frozen into the Arctic sea ice near the North Pole for six months and will be drifting with it for six more. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. But while the MOSAiC vessel has been able to continue its research on the ice, the coronavirus has prompted the cancellation of other Arctic expeditions, including this year’s EastGRIP field season, an annual mission to measure glacier flows in East Greenland. Greenland reported its first case of coronavirus March 16, and subsequently shut down all air travel, including domestic flights, for at least two weeks to protect its mostly indigenous population of 57,000 people from the pandemic. About 1,000 researchers visit Greenland each year, most of them arriving via regular air service from Denmark, which has reported more than 1,200 coronavirus infections, including four deaths. Nuuk, Greenland’s administrative capital, has been sealed off from the rest of the country due to concern about the spread of coronavirus and the devastating impacts previous outbreaks of respiratory diseases have had on the region’s indigenous peoples, Arctic Today reports. Some scientists are hopeful that research planned for later in the summer will be able to proceed if the virus subsides. At the same time, they worry that if the economic disruption lasts for several months, it would probably have a long-term effect on science budgets. Despite these concerns, Brooks Hanson, executive vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, said public and personal health and safety are the highest priority for its 62,000 members. To keep researchers working, the AGU has set up a learning exchange webpage, where members and educators can share resources and knowledge about online education in the classroom, field and lab. On the other side of the Atlantic, the European Geosciences Union canceled its annual Vienna assembly “due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation.” Instead, the EGU will host a week-long series of online activities during the first week of May. For now, no final decision has been made on the COP 26 global climate talks scheduled for November in Glasgow, Scotland. For climate researchers, losing a season’s worth of field data means that some long-running observations of temperature, precipitation and ice sheet changes from the Arctic to Antarctica could be interrupted. Some important instruments won’t be replaced or repaired in time to gather snow and ice data during the upcoming melt season. Continuous records of the ongoing research are important at a time when climate impacts are accelerating, especially in the Arctic. Such studies provide real-time details of how warming at the poles is disrupting global life support systems, with impacts that will be felt long after the coronavirus pandemic fades. At this point, the final impacts of the disruption can’t be fully assessed, and some federal research is proceeding, at least for the time being. “At this time NOAA’s research continues and our scientists are adapting,” NOAA Spokeswoman Keli Pirtle said, noting that the agency is minimizing social contact and incorporating procedures to isolate staff when needed. “Field researchers on NOAA vessels are still doing their data collection. Fortunately, technology allows many of the observations we use in our research to continue automatically.” For instance, she said, although researchers are no longer visiting Mauna Loa, the Hawaiian station where key carbon dioxide measurements are made, they continue to remotely monitor automated data collection there. How much the pandemic disrupts climate research depends on how long it lasts, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder. The economic impacts could have long-term effects on science budgets, but it’s too early to know for sure, he said. ”We have no idea right now how long before this thing passes,” he said. “The great unknown lies ahead of us. As far as August fieldwork, it’s all wait and see right now.” If the pandemic and responses to it persist for several months, most upcoming field research will likely be canceled. Restrictions on non-essential air travel makes the logistics of climate research more difficult, and there are also concerns about researchers potentially spreading the virus to relatively unaffected areas, and about how to treat scientists sickened by the virus in remote locations. Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, a climate and ice researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said the cancellation of the",

    "date": "2020-03-23T22:49:51-04:00",
    "content": "With the nation in a state of emergency over the coronavirus and Americans confronting a pandemic, the Trump administration has moved to expand and fast-track a proposal to limit the use of human health science in environmental decision-making. The move by the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday has prompted an outcry from public health officials and environmental activists. California’s top environmental official, the chair of the House Science Committee, the Union of Concerned Scientists and others have called for the EPA either to abandon the potentially far-reaching proposal or to extend the public comment period on the plan. The Trump EPA’s proposal, called the “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science” rule, would restrict the agency’s use of studies that rely on confidential human health data, including some of the seminal studies linking air pollution to premature death. The effort has been in the works for two years, but the Trump EPA published a “supplemental” notice last week that substantially extends the rule’s scope—and then gave the public only until April 18 to comment. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Science and Democracy, called for the EPA to schedule at least three virtual public hearings and extend the comment period at least 30 days beyond when the federal government lifts the national emergency. Although agencies are not always required to hold public hearings on regulatory proposals, the EPA must do so for proposals related to the Clean Air Act—a mandate some agency critics cited in their call for more time. “Bringing this extensive proposal forward during the COVID-19 pandemic is reckless and would divert critical public health expertise from the singular mission of protecting the public and controlling the pandemic,” Rosenberg wrote in a letter to the agency. “The supplemental greatly expands the scope of the draft rule and the researchers whose work would be subject to it.” California Secretary of Environment Jared Blumenfeld also requested in a letter that the comment period be extended at least 90 days: “A comment period that short would be inadequate for such a complex and consequential rule even in ordinary circumstances and is especially so in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic,” Blumenfeld wrote. Dena Adler, legal fellow for the Environmental Defense Fund, in a letter of protest to the agency, wrote, “It is unconscionable, dangerous and in contravention of due process under our nation’s laws, that you would take this action today and require the public—including public health experts on the front lines of saving lives imperiled by the coronavirus, and the millions of Americans heeding government and private sector responses to prevent harm by sheltering in place, closing schools and working remotely—to comment” by the proposed deadline. An EPA spokeswoman said in an email that the agency is considering all public comments it received on its original",

    "date": "2020-03-22T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "As giant swarms of locusts spread across East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, devouring crops that feed millions of people, some scientists say global warming is contributing to proliferation of the destructive insects. The largest locust swarms in more than 50 years have left subsistence farmers helpless to protect their fields and will spread misery throughout the region, said Robert Cheke, a biologist with the University of Greenwich Natural Resources Institute, who has helped lead international efforts to control insect pests in Africa. “I’m concerned about the scale of devastation and the effect on human livelihoods,” Cheke said, adding that he also worried about “the impending famines.” “Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the region needs money and equipment to deploy insect control teams in the affected regions,” he said. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. New swarms are currently forming from Kenya to Iran, according to the the United Nations locust watch website. Addressing the outbreak requires urgent, additional funding and technical help from developed countries, Cheke said, because the tiny size and budget of the United Nation’s Food and Agricultural Organization team responsible for locust monitoring and control is already overwhelmed. Changes in plant growth caused by higher carbon dioxide levels, as well as heat waves and tropical cyclones with intense rains, can lead to more prolific and unpredictable locust swarming, making it harder to prevent future outbreaks. The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) needs moist soil to breed. When rains are especially heavy, populations of the usually solitary insects can explode. In Kenya, one of the biggest swarms detected last year was three times the size of New York City, according to a March 12 article in the journal Nature. Swarms a fraction of that size can hold between 4 billion and 8 billion locusts. At times, the locusts in East Africa have swarmed so thick that they have prevented planes from taking off and their dead bodies have piled up high enough to stop trains on their tracks. The changing climate has spurred other insect invasions. Warmer winters, for example, are magnifying an ongoing bark beetle outbreak in western North America. Until the",

    "date": "2020-03-12T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Doctors and public health researchers are getting an increasingly accurate and nuanced picture of the many ways climate change damages human health. Now, questions have arisen about whether climate change contributed to the outbreak of COVID-19, whose spread the World Health Organization declared a pandemic on Wednesday. For example, did habitat loss, driven in part by climate change, make it easier for pathogens to spread among wildlife and for the virus to jump to humans? Does air pollution, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, make some people more vulnerable to contracting the illness? We spoke to Dr. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatrician and Interim Director of The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health (Harvard C-CHANGE), who has seen firsthand how climate change can harm children, mostly through the burning of fossil fuels. We asked him about the ways that climate change might have played a role in the emergence of COVID-19, about any parallels between “virus denial” and climate denial and about how to prepare for the inevitable next pandemic. A lightly-edited version of our conversation follows. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. A connection between COVID-19 and climate change doesn’t seem obvious at first glance, at least to lay people, so could you explain the links that you see? I think the strongest links I see are actually related, first of all, to air pollution, and fossil fuels as a source of air pollution, and fossil fuels, of course, are the major cause of climate change. The other connections I see are that the way we think about the environment as it pertains to health has gotten us into a rut with the emergence of infections like COVID and climate change. Let me explain a little bit more of what I mean by that. You look at climate change, we have transformed the nature of the Earth. We have fundamentally changed the composition of the atmosphere, and as such, we shouldn’t be surprised that that affects our health. We have, as a species, grown up in partnership with the planet and life we live with. So, when we change the rules of the game, we shouldn’t expect that it wouldn’t affect our health, for better or worse. That’s true of the climate. And the same principle holds for the emergence of infections. If you look at the emerging infectious diseases that have moved into people from animals or other sources over the last several decades, the vast majority of those are coming from animals. And the majority of those are coming from wild animals. We have transformed life on Earth. We are having a massive effect on how the relationships between all life on Earth operate and also with ourselves. We shouldn’t be surprised that these emerging diseases pop up. The principle is that we’re really changing how we relate to other species on Earth and that matters to our risk for infections. I’d like to drill down into the two points that you made. So let’s start with species and climate change. There are a lot of things that lead to habitat loss for species and bring them into closer proximity to human communities. Bulldozing a jungle can do that. But how does climate change play a role in decreasing the distance between wildlife and people? To be clear, we don’t know with COVID, what role if any the climate effects that we’re already seeing in species around the world may have had on the risk of this disease emerging. We know clearly that it had to do with a market in which animals were commingled, the bats and, potentially, pangolins. But it’s not clear, for instance, whether bat migration patterns, which have been influenced by climate, have played a role. But we have other examples. We see this extraordinary migration to the poles. We’re watching all kinds of life forms run away from the heat, and that has led to the spread of pathogens, because animals that carry pathogens came in contact with other animals that didn’t carry those pathogens and there was transmission. The constraints upon animal migration because of habitat loss may force animals into closer proximity. The bottom line here is that if you wanted to prevent the spread of pathogens, the emergence of pathogens, as we see not just with people and COVID, but as well with wildlife, you wouldn’t transform the climate. Because that forces species to come into contact with other species that may be vulnerable to infections. There are lots of forces, and habitat loss is a major contributor to it. I want to go back to the original thing you said when I asked you to tease out these links to climate, and that is about air pollution from fossil fuels, and how that affects human vulnerability to a respiratory ailment like COVID-19. Could you talk a little about that? I should be clear it’s not just fossil fuels. Burning anything, so it could be indoor pollution from cook stoves. It could be burning agricultural waste. It could be burning wood. It could be wildfire. Air pollution is strongly associated with people’s risk of getting pneumonia and getting sicker when they do get pneumonia. We don’t really have much in the way of evidence to show that connection with the COVID epidemics. Given what we know now, it would be very surprising to find that air pollution didn’t affect the risk of people either getting the disease or getting sicker when they do get the disease. Why is that? We have lots of research that shows that air pollution, particularly particulate matter air pollution, increases the risk of people getting sick with bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia, and that people who are exposed to more air pollution get sicker when they get exposed to those kinds of pathogens. There seems to be a pushback in some quarters about the severity of the virus and its spread. And that reminds me of climate denial. I hear the echoes, and I was wondering if you hear those echoes, too, between that push back and climate denial? And what are those echoes, if you do hear them? It’s hard to know. I’ve certainly heard officials downplay the risks of infection in the face of people who, I’d argue, have stronger scientific credentials and are raising more concerns. It’s hard to know where that lack of concern comes from. But it is certainly the case that the absence of science in discussing or trying to understand what’s going on is really unhelpful. We have scientists who’ve made their lives trying to understand what happens when you have populations that are exposed to diseases like COVID, and it would seem to me that we as a society would greatly benefit from listening to them rather than politicians. I’d encourage anyone to pick up on the Twitter feeds of the scientists who have spent decades researching these problems, and see what they’re saying. Ask yourself, if you were really sick, would you go to a politician, or would you go see a doctor? When there is this kind of push back or minimizing of the threat of this virus, what could the public health consequences be? I don’t know that, given the public discourse I’ve seen. that there are many people who are blowing this off. I don’t get the impression that there is anyone in our society, with the exception of certain politicians, who is looking at this and saying this is not an “all systems go” situation. I just saw an Op-Ed that said if we want science on demand, if we want a robust response to a pandemic, we have to have the systems in place to do that. As you look at this, what do we need in terms of research and preparation if we want a better response next time to a pandemic? Things that we don’t have now, for example? I think that at a very high level, the amount of funding that has gone into the public health infrastructure in the United States in recent years has been wildly disproportionate to the need. And so we shouldn’t expect to be ready for problems like this if we don’t in fact support public health financially. We’re in a position of playing catch up because we’ve underfunded the public health infrastructure that would be necessary to appropriately respond to this. How certain are you that there could be a next time, a next pandemic, and that climate change could play a role in that, to bring it all full circle? The likelihood is high that this will happen. This has happened through human history but the data we have shows that the pace is accelerating. That’s not terribly surprising. We’re living in highly dense urban places. Air travel is much more prevalent than it used to be. And climate is a part of what is fundamentally reshaping our relationship with the natural world. We are concerned, for instance, that the trees of New England are changing, turning over rapidly, and the new forests taking over New England may in fact be more fire-prone. Wildfires, which destroy forests and habitat, can lead to human-animal interfaces that wouldn’t have happened. Because when animals lose their homes they’re going to go somewhere else. Climate change is a destabilizing force when it comes to the spread of infection through several potential pathways. If you wanted to do something to prevent disease emergence, first of all we need to seriously reconsider how we do business with the biosphere. We can’t simply pretend that we can extract things and put species in assortments that they’ve never been in before, and hope that somehow doesn’t lead to disease emergence. And another good thing to do would be to prevent climate change because it changes how we relate to other species.

    "date": "2020-03-13T09:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "The conservative Heartland Institute, which made its name undercutting mainstream climate science, has launched a new effort to try to influence public discussion and political debate about global warming. The move comes as the organization is reportedly struggling financially and has fallen into renewed controversy over its work in Europe promoting climate denial there. Last week it laid off staff just weeks after it announced the hiring of a teenage German climate skeptic to counter the global popularity of environmental activist Greta Thunberg. The new website, called Climate at a Glance, includes brief explanations of key climate science and policy issues, many of which are either misleading or inaccurate. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “It’s attempting to emulate a more scientific website than previously,” said Robert Brulle, a visiting professor at Brown University who has studied public relations campaigns by the fossil fuel industry. “Other than that it’s still the same sort of systematic distortion.” An explainer of a carbon tax, for example, claims wind and solar power are “already very expensive.” In fact, those sources of energy are now competitive with or even cheaper than new coal or natural gas plants. A discussion of sea level rise claims that “there has been very little recent acceleration.” In truth, the rate of rise has more than doubled in recent years compared to during most of the 20th century. The website comes amid evidence that the clout of Heartland and other groups that have promoted skepticism about climate change may be waning. An increasing number of Republican politicians have sought to distance themselves from climate denial. Last month, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, a Republican, introduced a package of bills to promote carbon capture and sequestration technology. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), in her final year as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has been attempting to lead a bipartisan effort to pass energy efficiency and technology investment. “I think they’re becoming more and more marginal,” Brulle said of Heartland, noting that some major corporate funders such as ExxonMobil distanced themselves from the group years ago. “You have all the big fossil fuel companies, they’re not attacking climate science any more.” Last week’s layoff was part of what Heartland called a reorganization. But the HuffPost reported that the downsizing of “more than half” the staff was a result of financial problems for the organization. Their report said it was primarily mismanagement, rather than falling revenue, that led to the problems. In recent years, the group’s funders have included hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who was President Donald Trump’s largest campaign donor in",

Wheeler signed a new rule that relaxes the requirements that owners and operators of refrigeration equipment have leak detection and maintenance programs for hydrofluorocarbons, a set of refrigerants often referred to as “climate super-pollutants.” The rule change—the latest reversal of an Obama-era regulation—was part of the administration’s agenda to ease burdens on industry. “We just think it’s a baffling and wrong-headed move,” said David Doniger, a senior strategic director with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposed the rollback. “Considering there are thousands of facilities subject to these rules, [$24 million] is pocket change savings.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.

Sandy beaches are valuable ecosystems and recreational sites, and their loss would ripple deep into economies. But their destruction could ultimately heighten risks to human life, too. Up to 1 billion people are estimated to live in coastal areas around the world that are less than 10 meters above high tide. Despite how sea level rise has already begun to damage coastal communities and the increasingly dire warnings sounded about the future, growing numbers of people are expected to continue moving to coastal areas, given their economic importance. Of the world’s coastlines, one-third are sandy beaches, and they serve as a critical buffer against hurricanes and other marine storms, according to the study, published Monday. “A substantial portion” of them are already eroding, thanks to natural processes and human development, and climate change risks worsening the damage throughout the century, the study said.

    "date": "2020-02-20T19:41:48-05:00",
    "content": "The Democratic presidential candidates, while dividing predictably into moderate and progressive lanes, offered new insights into how they would approach climate action in their raucous ninth debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday night in Nevada that the oil and gas industries should be subject to lawsuits for climate damages. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) revealed that she favors paying dividends to households to distribute the proceeds of a carbon tax. And former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he thinks India is a bigger emissions problem than China. Each of these provocative stances is ripe for debate, and yet no debate was had on what surely will be key questions for any president faced with the task of reviving moribund U.S. climate policy in the wake of President Donald Trump’s climate denial. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Although the Las Vegas forum included a climate journalist as a moderator for the first time, and the moderators made clear climate change was a top issue for voters heading to the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, the format of the NBC/MSNBC-hosted debate was not up to the task of delving into the complex issue. Even with the field winnowed down to six, there were too many candidates, and too little time. “Honestly, there should be themed debates,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a protege and supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), tweeted after the debate. “Doing so educates the public far more on issues & actually serves the purpose of distinguishing who knows what they’re talking about +who doesn’t” on climate change, as well as other issues. Earlier in the campaign season, both MSNBC and CNN had hosted forums where each candidate had half an hour on stage alone to discuss his or her climate plan. But that didn’t give viewers an opportunity to compare and contrast the candidates—especially on tough issues like how they would garner political support and fund their ambitious goals to drive the U.S. economy to net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. Fracking remains the main battle line for Democratic candidates in the climate arena, but their exchange revealed some gaps in understanding. Klobuchar reiterated her position that natural gas is a necessary fossil fuel in the “transition” to cleaner energy, and promised tougher oversight of fracking: “I have made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one of them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that it’s safe,” she said. But Bloomberg pointed out, correctly, that much of the fracking underway was not for gas, but for oil, which can’t be defended as a “transition” fuel. Also, most fracking is taking place on private land—there are no federal permits to review. Bloomberg, who has made climate one of the key planks of his platform, took a position on fracking that even if backed by evidence, is unlikely to win him followers in the Democratic base. “We’re not going to get rid of fracking for a while,” he said, adding, “We want to go to all renewables. But that’s still many years from now.” Bloomberg leaned into the importance of regulating methane emissions from oil and gas drilling—a policy platform that doesn’t have the political rallying gusto of the Green New Deal, but will be essential to rein in warming in the short term. Sanders (I-Vt.) missed an opportunity to tout the economic benefits of the Green New Deal when asked how he’d address the workers who would lose their jobs if he achieved the complete phase-out of fracking he seeks. Instead, he led with the moral case for climate action: “What I tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us that if we don’t act incredibly boldly within the next six, seven years, there will be irreparable damage done not just in Nevada, not just to Vermont or Massachusetts, but to the entire world,” he said, adding, without embellishment, that the Green New Deal would create “up to 20 million good-paying jobs.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), meanwhile, held firm to her position that all new drilling and mining on public lands and all offshore drilling should be stopped. When asked about how she would ensure access to the minerals used in renewable energy, she said that need could be managed. “If we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that we’ve got to have access to, then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries, but in a way that is sustainable for the environment,” she said. “We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who don’t care about our environment and are not making it better.” Jon Ralston of The Nevada Independent asked Biden a question aimed at his readers: “What specific policies would you implement that would keep Las Vegas and Reno livable, but also not hurt those economies?” Biden launched mainly into a stock recitation of his climate plan—including 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, reinstated fuel economy standards, and investments in rail—without getting into the sobering truth about how long it would take for the resulting emissions cuts to curb the oppressive heat that is building in Nevada’s cities. Reminiscent of the unanswerable question the Democrats faced in their first debate last June—”Would your plan save Miami?”—Ralston’s query drove home the pitfalls of applying the bromide “all politics is local” to the discussion of solutions for a planetary problem. Vanessa Hauc, an Emmy-award winning senior correspondent specializing in climate for the Spanish-language Noticias Telemundo, only had an opportunity to ask one climate question—how far would Biden go in holding oil and gas executives accountable for climate change? “I would make sure they, number one, stop,” Biden said. “Number two, if you demonstrate that they, in fact, have done things already that are bad and they’ve been lying, they should be able to be sued, they should be able to be held personally accountable, and they should—and not only the company, not the stockholders, but the CEOs of those companies.” It would have been enlightening to hear where the other candidates stand on the question, especially the avowedly pro-business Bloomberg, as well as to hear where any of the candidates stand on the Grand Compromise that some—including an industry-backed coalition—have proposed: shielding the companies from liability in exchange for their support of a carbon pricing proposal. Klobuchar offered a new crucial detail about her own carbon pricing proposal—she believes that any revenue from a carbon tax should be returned to households in the form of dividends to offset higher energy costs. Previously, Klobuchar had only mentioned the goal of avoiding a “regressive” impact when imposing such a tax. Among the other candidates, former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg has in the past made clear his support for dividends as well, but none of the candidates have had to spend much time explaining their philosophies on carbon taxing. Sanders, notably, with the most expensive climate plan by far—$17 trillion—hasn’t had to address how he’d fund it in any detail. In the past, he has suggested that the massive new government works program he envisions in the Green New Deal could be paid for by cuts in defense spending. For Bloomberg, who had to fend off attacks over his wealth through much of the forum, the climate discussion afforded an opportunity to bolster his argument that he was using his money to contribute to society. His climate policy would be to extend the work he had already been funding through the Sierra Club’s campaign to shut down coal power plants, he said. Bloomberg showed some detailed knowledge of what’s happening in the energy market, but had some miscues. At one point, he accused Biden of praising an obsolete Nevada solar project. It is true that one big plant—the Crescent Dunes project 200 miles northwest of Las Vegas—is in dire financial straits, but Biden appeared to be talking about a different solar project entirely. (His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.) Also, Bloomberg responded to a query about how he’d deal with China on climate by seemingly minimizing the contribution of the world’s largest carbon polluter. “In all fairness, China has slowed down,” he said. “It’s India that is an even bigger problem.” Carbon emissions in India are indeed growing faster—at 8 percent per year—but are still overshadowed by the massive contribution of China, which is growing at 2.3 percent per year, according to the nonprofit organization the Global Carbon Budget. “You have to negotiate” with China, Bloomberg said. “What you have to do is convince the Chinese that it is in their interest, as well. Their people are going to die just as our people are going to die.” But Buttigieg countered, “I’m a little skeptical of the idea that convincing is going to do the trick when it comes to working with China. America has repeatedly overestimated our ability to shape Chinese ambitions.” Other than mentioning his inclusion of farming in his package of proposed climate solutions, Buttigieg made little effort to distinguish his plan from those of his opponents. “I think everybody up here has a plan that more or less does the same,” he said. (Sanders’ spokeswoman Briahna Joy Gray shot back on Twitter: “He’d certainly like us to think so.”) Buttigieg instead returned to his theme for the night—that Sanders and Bloomberg were each too polarizing to provide the leadership needed to forge consensus. “We need leadership to make this a national project that breaks down the partisan and political tug of war that prevents anything from getting done,” he said. It’s not clear that anyone could have come away from the Nevada debate with a sure sense of which contenders were best suited for the monumental political challenge of tackling climate change. But no one disputed Buttigieg’s timeline. “Let’s be real about the deadline,” said Buttigieg. “It’s not",

    "title": "Two New Studies Add Fuel to the Debate Over Methane",
    "date": "2020-02-20T21:46:51-05:00",
    "content": "Researchers this week released two debate-stoking new studies about methane, the powerful, climate-warming gas that scientists say promises an expeditious target for controlling global warming in the coming decades. One study, published in the journal Nature Wednesday, found that the extraction of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution has released more climate-warming methane—as much as 40 percent more—than scientists previously thought, a startling number that could drastically upend currently agreed-upon global emissions targets in the Paris climate agreement. The other study, published Thursday in Science, found that “minimal” methane was emitted from permafrost and geologic seepage as Earth was emerging from the last ice age, a finding that suggests that less methane than scientists thought might be emitted in coming decades as the polar regions warm. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Both reports are likely to trigger more debate about the sources of methane and what’s to blame for them. Methane is the second-most influential greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide, but has a much greater warming effect over a shorter period of time, meaning that cutting methane emissions is an especially effective and expedient way of slowing climate change. Though it’s clear that methane concentrations in the atmosphere have doubled since the industrial revolution—and are rising—researchers have not pinned down how much methane comes from natural geologic sources, like seepage from ocean vents or mud volcanoes, and how much from burning fossil fuels. In the Nature study, the researchers looked at ice core samples from pre-industrial Greenland and air samples from the Antarctic. They analyzed the samples’ isotopic fingerprints to determine how much of the methane originated from biological sources, like wetlands, and how much from natural geologic—or fossil—sources. They found that the natural geologic sources emitted about 5 million tons of methane. The estimate currently used by scientists, which is based on a different measurement method, puts the figure at 50 million tons. “That’s the major new measure,” said Benjamin Hmiel, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rochester who led the study. “We’re not saying there’s a change to total methane. We’re saying that biogenic is a larger slice of the pie and the fossil slice is smaller. And within our data we only start to see a growth in fossil methane around the end of the 19th century, coinciding with industrialization.” That finding suggests that emissions from fossil fuel extraction are vastly underestimated—by 25 to 40 percent, the authors say—because only man-made emissions from fossil fuel extraction can explain the difference. “The paper deepens a scientific debate, started three years ago, about the magnitude of global methane emissions from natural geologic seeps, and in extension, that of the fossil fuel industry,” explained Stefan Schwietzke, a scientist and methane expert with the Environmental Defense Fund. “The heart of the debate is about the validity of emission estimates from two very different types of measurements with their unique strengths and weaknesses. To understand the emission magnitudes, both methods need to be reconciled.” At least one prominent methane expert has already challenged one of the study’s primary conclusions. Daniel Jacob, who leads the atmospheric chemistry modeling group at Harvard University, said that the study’s finding that previous estimates of geologic methane were too low is “an important result” and “will greatly help me and others interpreting observations of atmospheric methane to infer global and regional methane fluxes.” But, he said, Hmiel and his co-authors go too far when they say that post-industrial methane emissions from fossil fuel production are correspondingly higher. “I totally disagree with this inference,” Jacob said. “The natural geological source is irrelevant for these estimates.” Jacob explained that, in his modeling, he would instead lower overall methane estimates from all sources. On Thursday, another study, also led by a University of Rochester postdoctoral student, was published in the journal Science. It also looked at ice core measurements, but from the last deglaciation, beginning around 20,000 years ago. “In some ways, that period is an analog for current warming,” said Michael Dyonisius, the study’s lead author. “In the last deglaciation, there’s an increase of greenhouse gasses that are clearly responsible for taking the Earth out of the ice age. The feedback is the same. There’s more greenhouse gas emissions and the Earth’s becoming warmer.” Dyonisius and his colleagues looked at isotopes of methane in ice core samples and found that methane emissions from ancient permafrost and hydrates—large deposits of methane under the ocean—were relatively small, about 19 million tons a year. They said that means that future methane emissions from these sources are likely to be lower than many researchers have projected. “We show that if there’s low methane emissions from old permafrost during that period, then likely the permafrost in the coming decades would also not emit a lot of methane,” Dyonisius said. But he noted that permafrost thawing and releasing methane will continue to be a problem in the overall greenhouse gas budget of the atmosphere. “We’re not saying permafrost melt is not a big deal,” Dyonisius said. He added, “The main difference is that in the last deglaciation we went from a cold period to a warm period—the Holocene. But now we’re going from a warm state into an even warmer state.” One prominent methane researcher disagreed with the paper’s conclusion that methane emissions will be minimal in coming decades, noting that most projections say it will rise significantly. “The warming that’s going to happen this century should induce permafrost thaw. It’s already happening,” said Katey Walter Anthony, a methane specialist with the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. “I don’t agree with their statement. There’s uncertainty, but there’s going to be methane released in the future.” While the papers may stir conversation about past and future methane sources, researchers—both involved in the studies and not—warn that the goal of reducing methane remains crucial. “The contribution of fossil fuel methane emissions to the increase in methane concentrations over the past century is large and reducing emissions will reduce warming,” Schwietzke stressed. “This debate does not change that reality.” A subhead in an earlier version of this story mischaracterized the findings of one study. The study found that fossil fuel-related methane emissions have been underestimated, not overestimated. In addition, the article mischaracterized the status of the lead author of the Science study and, in one of several times he was mentioned, misspelled his last name. Michael Dyonisius is a doctoral student, not a postdoctral student. Also, the figure 19 million tons was incorrectly used to describe an estimate of future methane emissions from ancient permafrost; the figure refers to emissions in Earth’s last deglaciation.

    "title": "Even the Hardy Tardigrade Will Take a Hit From Global Warming",
    "date": "2020-02-18T10:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "Scientists increasingly have been linking global warming with plant and animal die-offs now happening at a rate comparable to some of Earth’s worst mass extinction events. Heat takes a toll in many different ways. Cold-blooded animals like fish and reptiles simply can’t acclimate to warmer temperatures. In Australia, hotter sand in sea turtle nesting areas is turning all the hatchlings to females. And in recent years, flocks of dead birds have fallen out of the sky during extreme heat waves. New research suggests that even some of nature’s toughest microscopic species are vulnerable, including tiny tardigrades, invertebrates that live nearly everywhere, including on icy alpine summits and volcanoes, rainforests and the fringes of Antarctica. A study by University of Copenhagen scientists published in the journal Scientific Reports suggests that tardigrades, which have a reputation for tolerating extreme conditions like freezing cold, intense radiation or lengthy dehydration, may also succumb to global warming. Temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit are frequently lethal to a common tardigrade species found in Denmark, the scientists concluded. The results were surprising, said lead author Ricardo Neves, a University of Copenhagen biologist. “We expected the tardigrades—both in their active state and desiccated state—to survive higher temperatures, which was clearly not the case. We found their Achilles heel,” Neves said. “Tardigrades are definitely not the almost indestructible organism as advertised in so many popular science websites.” Tardigrades, sometimes called water bears or moss piglets, are colonizers that can survive in emerging new habitats like new moss on freshly cooled lava, and have even survived trips to outer space. Mark Blaxter, a scientist and tardigrade expert with the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a nonprofit genomics and genetics research organization in the UK, said that, tardigrades, like other organisms adapted to live in a 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 86 degrees Fahrenheit temperature range, will struggle in hotter environments. “Even species renowned as being super-resistant to environmental insults will be impacted. It’s good to be reminded that all of the ecosystem will be impacted, not just the megabiota we can easily see,” said Blaxter, who was not involved in the most recent research. In the new study, the researchers found that tardigrades are vulnerable to long-term exposure to high temperatures, with a mortality threshold just slightly warmer than the current maximum high temperature record in Denmark. One of the main reasons tardigrades are able to persist in extreme environments is because they can deactivate their metabolism, entering what scientists call a cryptobiotic state. But though they can survive like that for up to 20 years in cold that reaches minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, the new study indicates they are more sensitive to very warm temperatures. “With global warming, some tardigrades will die, and there will be less biodiversity due to the loss of tardigrades and other organisms,” said University of California, San Diego biologist Jim Kadonaga, who recently published research describing a protective protein that shields tardigrades from certain types of extreme conditions. In the University of Copenhagen experiments, exposure to a temperature of 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit for 48 hours killed half of all active tardigrades that weren’t acclimated. Those that had a chance to get used to warmer conditions gradually could withstand temperatures of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit for 48 hours. The length of exposure to heat is critical for tardigrades, Neves said. It took exposing tardigrades to 180.8 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour to kill half of them in their suspended cryptobiotic state. But after 24 hours of exposure, half died at a much lower temperature, 145.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The species tested by the researchers was collected from the rain gutter of a house in Denmark, a type of habitat where the temperature could approach the threshold level on a warm, sunny day. Global warming is expected to increase the intensity and length of heat waves in the decades ahead, potentially exposing tardigrades to more frequent lethal conditions. The lab tests investigated the thermotolerance of active, feeding tardigrades (R. varieornatus) by exposing them to four different temperature levels: 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 95 degrees Fahrenheit, 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit and 104 degrees Fahrenehit. The survival rate was compared to that of a control group kept at 41 degrees Fahrenheit (the temperature at which they were collected from the rain gutter). Inactive tardigrades were also exposed to a series of different temperature levels for different lengths of time, with the results showing how they can survive short periods of extreme heat, but die when they’re exposed for more than 48 hours. The findings bolster other recent studies that have shown how extreme heat waves can kill or impair a wide variety of organisms. In",

    "date": "2020-02-08T16:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "After three years of sidelining climate change research and thinning its roster of scientists, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a new five-year scientific plan this week to help American farmers cope with the worsening effects of the climate crisis. The “USDA Science Blueprint” was unveiled at a conference Wednesday by Scott Hutchins, a former pesticide industry executive who heads the agency’s research divisions. The plan, intended to guide “USDA’s science priorities,” lays out a broad agenda across a range of areas, from soil health to weather impacts on agriculture to data collection, and specifically mentions climate change. The new plan, welcomed by advocacy groups and the industry, represents a hopeful sign that the agency will realign its research priorities, especially in the wake of a series of weather disasters that have battered American farms and cost billions. “Climate change requires urgent attention, and farmers and their communities have woken up to this fact,” said Ricardo Salvador, senior scientist and director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It is refreshing to see the USDA under Secretary Perdue—who has previously denied the reality of climate change—acknowledging that agriculture is a contributor to climate change, can also be part of the solution, and must adapt in any case.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. But critics question how the agency will follow through. The plan, they say, pushes an agenda that fails to fundamentally change an agricultural system that degrades soil health, continues to emit greenhouse gases at a growing rate, and relies heavily on fossil fuels, chemicals and synthetic fertilizers. Lew Ziska, a former USDA researcher who left the agency last year after officials tried to sideline his research showing that nutrient levels in rice are dropping as carbon emissions rise, said of the new the plan: “Overall, nice brochure, pretty pix, and nice objectives, but I am extremely skeptical that their objectives will be accomplished.” From the onset of the Trump administration, top officials have come under fire for thwarting climate change research and priorities across the agency. In the earliest days of the administration, employees were coached to avoid the term “climate change” by agency officials, who said the issue was no longer a priority. Over the course of the next three years, the agency made a series of decisions that undermined research, including ordering researchers to include a disclaimer on research published outside the agency saying that it was “preliminary.” Perhaps most damaging, agency employees say, was the decision by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to move two research divisions, the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), out of the Washington area — an effort seen by many as a deliberate tactic to thin the ranks of agency scientists. If it was such a tactic, it worked: In the months leading up to the move, nearly two-thirds of the divisions’ researchers retired or left. Meanwhile, the administration has cut funding for the agency’s research divisions. “The elephant in the blueprint is of course that USDA Secretary Perdue has been fairly systematically working to weaken the Department’s scientific capacity, moving two of the key agencies involved in this report out of Washington, DC, knowing that it would lose many employees in the process,” said Ben Lilliston, director of rural policies and climate change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a progressive advocacy group. Lilliston added, “Perdue has also been an outspoken skeptic of climate risk, so while it’s good to see climate adaptation acknowledged as a priority it is undercut by the messaging coming from the Department’s leadership and President Trump.” Ziska noted that the agency’s Agricultural Research Service has lost 20 percent of its budget since the early",

    "title": "Shipping Lines Turn to LNG-Powered Vessels, But They’re Worse for the Climate",
    "date": "2020-02-01T09:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "Oceangoing ships powered by liquified natural gas are worse for the climate than those powered by conventional fuel oil, a new report suggests. The findings call into further question the climate benefits of natural gas, a fuel the gas industry has promoted as a “bridge” to cleaner, renewable sources of energy but is undermined by emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The most commonly used liquefied natural gas (LNG) engine used by cruise ships and cargo vessels today emits as much as 82 percent more greenhouse gas over the short-term compared to conventional marine fuel oil, according to the report, published earlier this week by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), an environmental think tank. “If we are serious about meeting the Paris [climate] agreement, temperature goals and decarbonizing the international shipping industry as part of that, then a switch to LNG as a marine fuel is counterproductive,” Bryan Comer, ICCT researcher and a co-author of the study said. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Shipping companies are increasingly turning to liquified natural gas, which is cleaner burning than conventional fuel oil and, with the glut of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing, increasingly inexpensive. When burned, natural gas emits less carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides than conventional marine fuel. Methane, the primary component of natural gas is, however, more than 30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. If even a small amount of methane leaks into the atmosphere instead of being burned, those emissions can outweigh the fuel’s lower carbon dioxide emissions. The current study, which was funded by environmental group Stand.earth, found that the LNG engine most widely used by the shipping industry and by cruise ship companies, allowed 3.7 percent of methane to pass unburned through the engine and into the atmosphere. This is due partly to ship engine designs that typically include an open “crankcase” that vents a small amount of unburned gas, and engine tuning that lowers nitrous oxide emissions at the expense of increased methane emissions. The 3.7 percent of methane emitted from ships is a higher percentage of leakage than across the rest of the natural gas sector combined. A recent study by scientists with the Environmental Defense Fund and more than a dozen research institutions found 2.3 percent of methane leaks into the atmosphere from gas wells, pipelines, storage facilities and other infrastructure. Recent regulations by the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency whose member states cooperate on regulations governing the international shipping industry, have set more stringent requirements for emissions of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that pose health concerns for ship passengers, crew members, and port communities. The regulations favor natural gas because the fuel emits lower levels of local pollutants that are harmful to human health than conventional fuel oil. “If we are going to get serious about tackling health and climate we need to be switching to fuels that emit zero emissions of both pollutants,” Comer said. IMO regulations are also tightening carbon dioxide emissions from new ships, but the regulations do not apply to methane emissions. The report found zero-emission solutions such as batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and wind-assisted propulsion could address local pollutants and greenhouse gases, though these alternative technologies remain under development. LNG made up less than 3 percent of ship fuel consumption from",

    "date": "2020-01-20T10:00:01-05:00",
    "content": "When patients participate in health studies, their medical and genetic details are typically kept anonymous to protect them. A controversial Trump administration plan to limit the scientific studies used in policymaking could put that anonymity in jeopardy, a new study warns. Later this year, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to finalize a proposal that would preclude the use of independent environmental health studies in setting pollution controls, unless the researchers made public the raw data underlying the studies. The EPA and its backers, including industries that are affected by pollution standards, contend that such a measure would deliver the strongest science for setting pollution standards. But thousands of scientists, environmentalists and public health advocates maintain that the proposal would profoundly undermine the use of independent science in protecting human health. Seminal environmental health studies often rely on confidential data, and without that research showing harm to human health, scientists and environmentalists say the EPA could push for looser pollution limits. A new study published this week in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives argues that the proposed EPA rule change would increase the risk that confidential health data could be linked back to patients. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Currently, scientists must share analyzed data through the peer review process for research journals and with the EPA. The Trump administration proposal would require that the “raw data,” which is much more detailed but still does not use people’s names, be turned over to the government and others without a clear set of safeguards to protect people’s privacy as there currently is in academia. The new study shows how five essential kinds of data that are used in health studies—patients’ location, medical data, genetic information, occupation and housing—could be used to re-identify individuals by cross-referencing them with public and commercial data sets, even after the studies anonymized the data by removing the names, birth dates and other overt identifiers. Re-identification is when anonymized data such as names or addresses can be linked back to one person or several people. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the main federal law governing the privacy of health information, does protect some data of participants in environmental health studies, but it is not adequate, said Julia Green Brody, the principal investigator of the analysis and executive director of the Silent Spring Institute, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that does research on environmental chemicals and women’s health. Other protections against such re-identification also exist now in academia and the EPA. But scientists, environmentalists and public health advocates fear those could be slipped or set aside if the EPA’s new controversial data standard goes into effect. An EPA spokeswoman said in an email that the agency’s proposed “secret science” rule would not make personal data more vulnerable to re-identification, because it would “follow all laws” regarding data privacy and take into account public comment on the issue. The rule was delayed after an outpouring of opposition from the academic community, the editors of major scientific journals, former EPA administrators and others. But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has said he remains committed to enacting the plan. The agency’s Science Advisory Board is meeting next week to discuss a draft recommendation that Wheeler address numerous issues, including privacy, before proceeding with the rule. The new standard would apply to any research data and would be retroactive, affecting, for example, landmark studies that undergird the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Environmental health data, by its nature, is much more reliant on the location, occupation and even housing of its participants than other kinds of medical research. Measurements of exposure to pollutants are usually at the level of a job, home or an individual. At the same time, more consumer data is being collected about Americans by the devices and mobile phone apps they use, the authors said. For instance, more people have wearable devices such as smartphones and Fitbits that continuously gather health and location information. The abundance of consumer data that’s publicly available or can be purchased could be cross-referenced with anonymized study data to identify people, the researchers found. The analysis is based on a dozen studies that mostly began in the",

    "title": "Trump Moves to Limit Environmental Reviews, Erase Climate Change from NEPA Considerations",
    "date": "2020-01-09T18:57:10-05:00",
    "content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday proposed sharply limiting environmental reviews of pipelines and other major federally permitted infrastructure projects, a move that would sweep away a hurdle slowing his agenda for unfettered fossil fuel development. The new guidance would curb federal agencies from considering climate impacts by specifying that agencies are only required to analyze impacts that are immediate, local and direct. The administration’s proposed rule, which will be open for public comment before being finalized, also would relieve agencies of any duty to consider cumulative environmental impacts. “Many of America’s most critical infrastructure projects have been tied up and bogged down by an outrageously burdensome federal approval process,” Trump said in an address from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. “From day one, my administration has made fixing this regulatory nightmare a top priority. For the first time in 40 years, we’re going to completely overhaul the dysfunctional bureaucratic system that has created these massive obstructions.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The move to overhaul implementation rules for the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which marked its 50th anniversary on Jan. 1, was portrayed by Trump as a modernization. But critics argue that the president is proposing changes that would undermine the bedrock environmental protection law, which establishes the duty of the federal government to act “as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations.” They vowed to fight the effort. “While our world is burning, President Trump is adding fuel to the fire by taking away our right to be informed and to protect ourselves from irreparable harm,” said Gina McCarthy, the new president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). McCarthy, who served as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration, added: “We will use every tool in our toolbox to stop this dangerous move and safeguard our children’s future.” Flanked by men in hard hats and orange construction vests, industry officials and members of his economic team, Trump stressed his aim to speed the building of highways, roads and bridges. But the NEPA impact that has proved most nettlesome to the administration has been stalling the oil and gas pipelines and coal leasing Trump’s administration has sought to push. Trump’s move follows a series of federal court rulings that have stymied his efforts to spur fossil fuel projects—most notably the high-profile Keystone XL pipeline to expand U.S. imports of carbon-intensive Canadian tar sands oil. Trump had signed an executive order within days of taking office to reverse President Barack Obama’s decision to halt the project over climate concerns. But Keystone XL has been tied up in litigation since then, with a federal judge ruling last August that federal agencies “cannot escape their responsibility” to evaluate alternatives under NEPA. Amid the Trump administration’s all-out effort to ease the regulatory burden on the fossil energy industry, federal courts have repeatedly ruled that agencies were failing to live up to their duties under NEPA. Courts slowed construction of a major natural gas pipeline in the Southeast, and expansion of coal mining in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming and on Navajo land in Arizona. The federal Bureau of Land Management’s Utah office in September voluntarily suspended 130 oil and gas leases under the threat of NEPA lawsuits. Trump’s Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist now in charge of agencies that oversee oil, gas and coal leasing on federal lands and coastlines, called the NEPA plan “a really, really big proposal” that “affects virtually every significant decision made by the federal government that affects the environment.” Turning from the podium to Trump, Bernhardt said, “I believe it will be the most significant deregulatory proposal you ultimately implement.” The fossil fuel industry and its allies have long railed against NEPA, especially over the past decade, when courts began ruling that NEPA required that both direct and indirect climate impacts be assessed. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) led an effort to amend NEPA to bar consideration of global warming impacts, but it never garnered sufficient support to advance in Congress. From the start, Trump took up the cause of NEPA reform with all the enthusiasm of a real estate developer who saw his own projects derailed over environmental concerns. His administration has issued and proposed five other pieces of guidance to circumscribe NEPA reviews, including a plan floated last summer to limit consideration of greenhouse gas emissions in planning for federal projects. But in the new proposal, the White House said it determined it was “not appropriate” to address a single category of impacts in regulations. Instead, the proposal seeks to limit the scope of all NEPA reviews in a way that appears to rule out consideration of climate change. The only environmental effects that federal agencies would be required to consider are those that are “reasonably foreseeable and have a reasonably close causal relationship to the proposed action or alternatives.” “Effects should not be considered significant if they are remote in time, geographically remote, or the product of a lengthy causal chain,” the proposal says. It also specifies that environmental reviews are not required under NEPA for non-discretionary decisions or for those with minimal federal funding or involvement—giving many developers an opportunity to elude the environmental review process altogether. The proposal sets a time limit of two years for detailed environmental reviews. Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the proposal would “punch loopholes into long-standing protections under the National Environmental Policy Act and would put communities at risk and worsen climate change.” Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, called it “one of the most egregious actions the Trump administration has taken to limit the federal government’s response to climate change yet.” The proposal, in essence, would fulfill a wish list delivered to the White House last fall by 33 industry groups, led by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who complained of “unreasonable costs and long project delays” caused by NEPA. API President and CEO Mike Sommers praised the proposal in a prepared statement: “Reforming the NEPA process is a critical step toward meeting growing demand for cleaner energy and unlocking job-creating infrastructure projects currently stuck in a maze of red tape.” Trump’s description of the NEPA process—”It takes 20 years, 30 years, it takes numbers nobody would even believe”—is at odds with reality for the vast majority of projects. The White House Council on Environmental Quality’s own statistics show that 95 percent of the more than 50,000 actions subject to NEPA each year are already exempt from detailed environmental review. Environmental groups argue that the subset of actions that require a detailed review—like the Keystone XL Pipeline—warrant the scrutiny, pointing to the spill of thousands of gallons of oil from the Keystone system in North Dakota this past October. NEPA, among the first environmental laws passed by Congress and signed by President Richard Nixon, requires comprehensive studies into the potential environmental impacts of “major” federal actions or projects—with an analysis of alternatives. The sweeping language of the statute asserts the federal government’s duty to “use all practical means. … To fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations.” “As a global multigenerational problem that affects all of humanity and natural resources, climate change would seem to fit precisely within what the statute has in mind,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Gerrard, who spent many years as a litigator, said that if he were representing a project applicant he would want consideration of climate change included in the environmental impact analysis even if Trump succeeds in his NEPA overhaul. “There’s a good chance the courts will … say it needs to be considered and an [environmental impact statement] could well be struck down for failure to consider it regardless of what this guidance says,” Gerrard said. “Rational planning involves looking at foreseeable conditions, and arguably it’s malpractice for an architect or engineer to ignore foreseeable considerations when designing a project.” The overhaul of NEPA guidance is just the latest of dozens of actions by the Trump administration to throw open the doors to unfettered fossil energy development and abandon even recognition of the threat of climate change. Just this week, the Trump administration released the federal government’s latest annual National Preparedness Report, which for the first time in the eight-year history of the accounting of threats and hazards failed to mention climate change, drought or sea-level rise. There will be a 60-day public comment period on the NEPA proposal, with public hearings scheduled in Denver and in Washington, D.C., in February.

    "date": "2019-12-24T09:10:41-05:00",
    "content": "As the end of this year’s holiday shopping frenzy nears, increasingly environmentally conscious online customers are taking to the internet to complain about waste. “Can you please explain this ridiculous surplus of packaging used to ship a tiny box of pointe shoe ribbons? WE CANNOT!!! TOLERATE! WASTE LIKE THIS!!” tweeted one Amazon user. Another pointed out the irony of ordering a shampoo bar to cut down on packaging only to have it arrive wrapped in plastic in a giant box. Amazon’s customer service team dutifully replies to complaints. But another aspect of the company’s online shopping business puts more pressure on the environment than packaging: the ever-faster delivery speeds offered under the loyalty program Amazon Prime. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Since April, customers who pay for an annual Prime subscription can get one-day delivery for qualified items. Some items are even available the same day. Given Amazon’s clout with roughly 40 percent market share in U.S. retail and 30 percent in the UK, rivals such as Walmart and Target have also sought to accelerate their own deliveries, conditioning consumers to expect speed. This trend is leading to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions from ecommerce, research indicates, not only among retailers but also at the logistics companies and postal services that deliver to your doorstep. Shorter delivery times often mean more use of air freight instead of overland travel, and they give logistics companies less time to optimize routes. Across its operations, Amazon emitted 44 million metric tonnes equivalent of carbon dioxide last year—roughly the same as Denmark. Emissions at logistics company UPS rose 6 percent last year to 14.6 million metric tonnes from a year earlier, in part because of increased reliance on aircraft. “The problem isn’t buying online—it’s how the delivery is implemented and how packages come to our door,” said Anne Goodchild, a transportation engineer at the University of Washington’s Supply Chain Transportation and Logistics Center. “The delivery companies have no incentive to group them together or don’t have time to do so while aiming for shorter deadlines, so we’re seeing a proliferation of trips being made.” About 35 percent of Amazon’s packages were being delivered with one-day shipping as of August, according to Rakuten Intelligence, more than triple the number from two years ago. So-called last-mile delivery, or a product’s transit from warehouse to its final destination, has become more complex as the number of deliveries to homes has surged. Routes have become more atomized, with more stops in residential areas, and multiple delivery attempts are often needed when people are not home. Returns drive up emissions further. Cities such as New York and London have tried to stem the tide by imposing restrictions on daytime deliveries and creating low-emissions zones in city centers that ban certain vehicles. The choices customers make when shopping online can also have an impact on the carbon footprint of the purchase. Decisions to opt for slower delivery, to bundle more items into an order or to “click and collect” at a local shop all reduce emissions. A study by consultancy Bain & Company found that by doubling the average number of items purchased per ecommerce transaction and avoiding split shipments, retailers can reduce average per-item emissions by 30 percent. Walmart is trying to nudge shoppers into making greener choices with its so-called smart cart technology, which shows customers which items are available from the same fulfilment center. If they choose these items, they get next-day delivery for free. Jenny Davis-Peccoud, a partner at Bain, said that retailers were only starting to figure out how to manage their emissions from digital retail. “This is an emerging issue as companies are seeing online sales really growing.” In Europe, IKEA aims to make 100 percent of its delivery vehicles electric by",

All that remained of the package at the end of months-long negotiation and debate were measures that will be politically useful to Republicans—most notably, biofuel subsidies. It was an affirmation both of the upper hand that the GOP has with its control of the Senate and the White House and of the party’s hostility to federal actions that would help displace oil, natural gas and coal. Support for solar energy, electric vehicles and energy storage all were jettisoned. If Democrats were able to exert any influence in the energy provisions of the $1.4 trillion budget, it was only to support provisions Republicans supported—like shoring up coal miners’ benefits—or to register ineffectual protest at the Trump administration. For example, Democrats were able to include language in the spending package opposing federal loan guarantees to benefit the natural gas and plastics industries in Appalachia, and to deny federal funds to relocate the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management closer to the oil and gas industry it oversees.

    "date": "2019-11-05T13:04:42-05:00",
    "content": "As fierce Santa Ana winds whipped the wildfires outside of Los Angeles, stirring exactly the kind of infernos that scientists expect in a hotter, drier California, President Donald Trump was gloating over the new allies he has won in his epic battle to block that state’s efforts to fight climate change. California has been a world innovator in crafting environmental policy, and its pioneering approach to the difficult issue of carbon emissions from cars helped put the United States on course to cleaner, more efficient vehicles. But a multi-pronged assault by the Trump administration now seeks both to hobble California’s climate efforts and to shred the state’s reputation as an environmental leader. In its latest move, the Trump administration doubled down on its fight to eliminate the state’s carbon emissions rules for vehicles. It had already revoked California’s authority to set higher standards. Now it was pressuring carmakers to take its side in California’s lawsuit over the move. When GM, Fiat Chrysler and Toyota made the surprise decision to comply last week, Trump tweeted: “California has treated the Auto Industry very poorly for many years, harming Workers and Consumers. We are fixing this problem!” The attack isn’t just on auto standards. On Sunday, Trump tweeted a threat to cut U.S. aid for fighting California wildfires, reiterating his previous false claim that they are due to the state (which owns of just 2 percent of the forest land within its borders) failing to “clean” its forest floor. Trump’s Justice Department sued the state a week earlier, arguing that California exceeded its authority when it launched a cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec to lower fossil fuel emissions. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. At the same time, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has threatened to use its authority under the Clean Air Act to withdraw federal highway funds from the state over air pollution, and to initiate enforcement action for water pollution violations. In a flourish, the EPA blamed the latter on human waste and needles from homeless people in San Francisco. Those warnings, issued directly from the desk of EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, were at odds with the agency’s hands-off approach under Trump. At a time when EPA is weakening environmental standards on both air and water pollution and enforcement activity is at its lowest level in a decade, the agency was invoking one of the most severe penalties available, for a state that has invested billions in improved air quality and has among the best compliance records in the nation on water pollution. California’s governor has called the moves “pure retaliation,” while former federal officials say that the unusual nature of the enforcement actions, and the management of the cases by top Trump appointees in Washington, reeks of political score-settling. Together, the Trump administration’s actions try to deliver the message that California is a laggard in addressing visible air pollution and sewage, and that the state’s aggressive focus on global warming is a misguided distraction at best. But the Trump administration’s California narrative falls apart with a cursory review of the science and the state’s record as a national leader in environmental protection. And it remains to be seen whether it has the legal arguments to persuade the courts, which will have the final say. This is not the first time that politicians have sought to caricature California as a victim of its own progressive policies.

    "date": "2019-09-06T08:20:00-04:00",
    "content": "The world’s leading oil companies increasingly have argued that they must be part of the world’s transition to a low-carbon future. But a new report shows that despite their rhetoric, they continue to spend their money as if that transition may never come. In just the past year, the biggest global companies committed billions of dollars to projects that will likely lose money if the world slashes fossil fuel use fast enough to meet the Paris climate accord goals, the report, released Thursday night, shows. That poses serious risks to investors. “While they may say they support the Paris Agreement, whatever that means, it’s not reflected in their behavior,” said Andrew Grant, a senior analyst at Carbon Tracker Initiative, a financial think tank focused on energy transition. In effect, oil companies are giving the world—and their investors—an either-or proposition: Either their balance sheets go bust when oil demand plummets, or the world does as warming soars past 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F). It’s one or the other, the report says. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The oil and gas industry has come under increased pressure from investors who want to know that the companies they finance are navigating a future of dropping fossil fuel demand. Those investors include a broad swath of society, from large financial institutions to public pension funds. In response, some companies have been trying to show they are taking the issue seriously. Many have committed to lowering the emissions associated with producing and refining oil and gas. Some have been spending significant sums on renewable energy and electric car charging infrastructure (though that spending still represented only about 1 percent of the industry’s budget last year, according to one report). And several are pushing for a carbon tax. The new analysis by Carbon Tracker looks much deeper, examining specific projects that energy companies are planning, and trying to determine whether or not they actually fit with the Paris goals. Carbon Tracker did not examine the emissions associated with the projects, but instead focused entirely on their finances: “The logic we use is that of the market,” Grant said. Grant and his team determined what the cost of oil would be under various scenarios in which governments take increasingly strict actions to limit global warming. Their analysis used data from the International Energy Agency that estimates global energy demand under the various scenarios. Then, the team examined the economics of specific oil projects, determining which ones would be too costly to pay-off under each scenario, and which would remain profitable even in a world of dwindling oil demand. They found that billions of dollars in new projects that were greenlit last year would lose money if the world succeeds in limiting warming to below 2°C. Not a single tar sands project is likely to pay back investors under a 2°C scenario. In fact, they found that because of the great expense of extracting oil from Canada’s tar sands, or oil sands, the projects wouldn’t even pay off under a higher scenario that would lead to nearly 3°C of warming. That scenario assumes countries will enact the commitments they’ve made under the Paris Agreement but take no more action. Essentially, Carbon Tracker found that either the days of profitable new oil sands projects are over or we are headed to a future of dangerous warming. Despite this, last year ExxonMobil sanctioned a new $2.6 billion project, the first major new oil sands project in years, though it’s already been delayed. Much of the U.S. fracking potential may also prove too expensive to exploit in a low-carbon world, according to the report. A $13 billion Canadian liquid natural gas project, funded by Shell and several Asian companies, also would prove to be a money-loser in scenarios limiting warming to less than 2°C. In all, the industry would have to slash future spending at least 60 percent to comply with the Paris Agreement goals, compared with the higher scenario of announced policies. Carbon Tracker found that, already, existing projects will produce more than enough oil to send the world past 1.5°C of warming, even with some carbon capture and storage technology in place. Put another way, limiting warming to 1.5°Celsius would mean oil companies shouldn’t break ground on any new projects, and that some of their current investments would be “stranded” and lose money. “Ultimately it comes down to the planet’s finite limits,” Grant said. In order to limit warming, only a certain amount of carbon can be emitted, and therefore only certain amounts of oil and other fuels can be burned. Meeting the Paris goals will require steep cuts in the use of oil, and that would necessarily drive down oil prices. “It pays to consider the implication of those finite limits,” Grant said. “At the moment, I don’t see any oil and gas company that includes those limits in its investment processes.” Published Sept. 6,",

    "date": "2019-09-09T15:28:14-04:00",
    "content": "ICN occasionally publishes Financial Times articles to bring you more business and climate reporting. NEW YORK — When Rae Arora’s property company began building a block of 115 flats in Brooklyn, the blueprint called for the blue flames of natural gas for heat, hot water and the burners in kitchen stoves. Plans have changed since then because of a tussle between National Grid, the UK-based energy utility, and Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York. Instead of gas, electricity will be now used for heating in the building, backstopped by a diesel generator, Arora said. National Grid owns a utility that distributes gas to parts of New York City and neighbouring Long Island. In May, the utility refused all new gas service after the Cuomo administration turned down a permit for an additional supply pipeline. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The drama intensified last month when Cuomo said his administration had received reports that National Grid was improperly denying service, including to existing customers who temporarily needed to turn off their connections. The governor suggested National Grid could lose its right to operate in the state. National Grid, which is under intense scrutiny in its home market after a major blackout last month, contends it needs the pipeline to meet a 10 percent increase in gas demand over the next decade as New York’s economy grows and building owners abandon oil as a source of heat. A coalition of environmental groups have pressured Cuomo to block it. The dispute encapsulates thorny questions policymakers face as shale drilling unleashes U.S. gas output while climate scientists urge a sharp reduction in fossil fuel use. Natural gas produces less carbon dioxide than oil or coal when it is burned, but it still accounts for 43 percent of New York state’s emissions from combustion, according to a government report. U.S. gas production has risen 60 percent in the past decade to an estimated 91 billion cubic feet per day. The most prolific gasfield lies a few hundred miles west of New York City in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania, offering a convenient source of energy. Gas is now cheaper than heating oil, adjusted for energy value. Under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City encouraged a shift to gas in part because it causes less pollution. But increasingly dire warnings about the climate have amplified calls for a halt to new pipelines. The Cuomo administration earlier this decade rejected the Constitution gas pipeline proposed to run through upstate New York. Federal regulators initially agreed that the state was in its right to reject the permit, but they reversed that decision last month. “The science is very clear globally that we need to stop building fossil fuel infrastructure. It’s a climate disaster,” said Kim Fraczek, director of Sane Energy Project, a campaign group in New York. Blaming interstate pipeline supply constraints, the New York utility Con Edison in March suspended new gas connections for most of suburban Westchester county. Cuomo’s department of public service said it is investigating both Con Edison and National Grid “to determine whether they took appropriate actions to balance the need for reliability with customer impacts in declaring a moratorium on new natural gas hookups.” In August it expanded the investigation into National Grid after businesses complained of improper refusals. The Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline project, or NESE, would increase gas volumes by 400 million cubic feet per day to National Grid customers in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island. The market already consumes about 2.8 billion cubic feet per day on average. The pipeline company Williams would build the $926.5 million pipeline more than 20 miles under water from a hub in New Jersey to a link off the coast of Queens. A study commissioned by National Grid found that using NESE would reduce net greenhouse gas emissions between",

    "date": "2019-08-22T10:33:18-04:00",
    "content": "Eight environmental organizations launched the first challenge to the Trump administration’s moves to weaken the Endangered Species Act, filing a lawsuit Wednesday that aims to prevent what they call the gutting of one of the country’s most successful conservation laws. The Trump administration announced last week that it was making major changes to the rules underpinning the Endangered Species Act. Under those changes, expected to take effect in September, government agencies won’t consider the effects of climate change in determining whether to list a species as threatened or endangered and will be less likely to protect habitat considered essential for species to survive the effects of global warming. “There’s nothing in these rules aimed at protecting wildlife or making it easier to factor in how climate change is impacting species,” said Kristen Boyles, an attorney with Earthjustice, which led the lawsuit. “In fact, the language is designed specifically to prevent looking at the consequences beyond the present day, which is exactly what we need to be doing with respect to climate change. It goes entirely in the wrong direction.” The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks to have the administration’s rule changes taken off the books. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Those rule changes come just a few months after the United Nations issued a landmark report saying that maintaining biodiversity is critical to conserving the ecosystems humans depend on for survival. “The Endangered Species Act is the last line of defense for species,” said Rebecca Riley, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The recent UN biodiversity report concluded that 1 million species around the globe are at risk of extinction because of climate change, and rather than taking steps to address the crisis, the administration is weakening the rules and prioritizing the interests of polluters.” The group’s lawsuit says the Trump administration violated two procedural laws—one that requires a full environmental analysis of any major rule changes and another that requires that the public has a chance to review and comment on them. The proposed changes, first put forward by the administration last year, received about 800,000 comments, mostly opposed to the revisions. The group alleges that the administration made major changes in the final rules that the public was never allowed to review. The groups also say the administration violated a key section of the law that requires federal agencies to ensure that their actions don’t jeopardize the survival of any threatened or endangered species and don’t destroy or “adversely modify” habitat that has been designated as critical for a species survival. “The Trump administration is changing the rules on what ‘adversely modify’ means,” Riley said. “They’re setting the bar so high that no one project is likely to meet that standard.” The new rules will also make it harder to designate “unoccupied habitat”—which refers to habitat that might not be a species’ primary habitat—as critical. “This can be very important in the long term,” said Jason Rylander, a senior staff attorney with Defenders of Wildlife, “especially with climate change, when migration is changing.” The groups have also filed a notice that they plan to amend the lawsuit to encompass some of the administration’s more controversial changes to the law. These include a revision that will allow economic considerations in the decision-making process for listing a species and one that will remove automatic protections for newly listed threatened species. Previously, threatened species—the classification just below “endangered”—were automatically given the full protection of the law, except in certain cases. The administration’s rule change will mean that’s no longer the case. The attorneys general of California and Massachusetts have also said they plan to sue the administration, but neither office provided a timeframe Tuesday. The Endangered Species Act has successfully protected 99 percent of listed species, including the humpback whale, bald eagle and grizzly bear, but it has long come under attack from the ranching, farming, oil and mining industries, which have viewed it as a roadblock to their expansion. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas industry lobbyist, has said the act imposes an “unnecessary regulatory burden on our citizens.” Bernhardt celebrated the changes last week, along with the American Petroleum Institute, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation. “This approach will eliminate unnecessary time and expense and ease the burden on farmers and ranchers who want to help species recover,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. In addition to Earthjustice, the groups that sued are the Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, the Humane Society of the United States, the National Parks Conservation Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and WildEarth Guardians.

Increased heat waves and more periods of stagnant air resulting from global warming will worsen existing air pollution across much of China, the scientists concluded. This presents a heightened challenge for a country already choking on airborne pollutants that cause more than 1 million premature deaths there each year. “For Chinese policy makers working to improve current air quality and protect public health, our finding is a daunting conclusion, and one that underscores the need to tackle the challenges of both climate change mitigation and air quality at the same time,” the authors wrote in the study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

    "content": "One of the main agencies that rates the creditworthiness of big borrowers, including cities and corporations, has brought on board a data firm specializing in climate risks. It’s a signal that rating agencies are paying more attention to global warming and its impact in the financial markets. Credit ratings, much like individual credit scores, assess how likely it is that a borrower will repay debt. Those ratings can affect how much governments and companies are able to borrow and how much it will cost them. Just the threat of a lower credit rating can pressure cities and companies to be more proactive in taking steps to mitigate risks, and now those risks are starting to include climate change. “More and more, issuers and investors want to know how they are exposed to climate events,” said Michael Mulvagh, head of communications in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East for Moody’s Corporation, which owns one of the largest U.S. ratings agencies. He said Moody’s decision to purchase a major stake in Four Twenty Seven, a company that analyzes the risks to corporations and governments from climate extremes such as sea level rise, heat stress and storms, “will help us go deeper into and refine how we assess physical risks caused by environmental factors.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.

The move by Moody’s signifies a notable step toward financial institutions committing to the idea that climate change should be a routine consideration when evaluating the financial strength of any government or company and their ability to pay their debts. “For [Moody’s] to come and buy this company that’s very focused and has some expertise in climate risks, it looks like they’re making this a very big priority,” said Kathy Hipple, a financial analyst with the Institute for Energy, Economics and Financial Analysis. “I think it’s very positive and should be noted by the industry.” In",

    "date": "2019-07-19T08:42:53-04:00",
    "content": "The University of Alaska Fairbanks is a hub for Arctic climate research, and a magnet for top scientists and international collaborations—and it’s in trouble. Alaska Gov. Michael Dunleavy has slashed the university system’s state funding by more than 40 percent, and efforts in the legislature to restore the money have so far failed. It’s not yet clear how the funding cut will play out at the universities, but some experts worry that when it comes to the future of climate science there, the damage is already done. “Researchers are going to leave—that’s the bottom line,” said John Walsh, the chief scientist at UAF’s International Arctic Research Center. “They’ll take their research funding elsewhere.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. With experts on permafrost, short-lived climate pollutants, sea ice and more, UAF has earned a reputation as a leader in Arctic climate research. Its research is often the product of years of work with partners from universities worldwide. While much of the funding for that research comes from federal grants, the Republican governor’s state funding cuts signal an uncertain future for the university—one that will likely send faculty and graduate students elsewhere, and which could slow momentum on crucial monitoring projects that are helping scientists grapple with the rapid rate of climate change in the Arctic. The announcement of the cuts on June 28 triggered a crisis on campus, several UAF scientists told InsideClimate News. Senior scientists said they have been fielding phone calls and emails from worried graduate students and research partners, wondering if their plans to work with UAF were safe. Some began seeking back-up plans. Once the graduate students start leaving, Walsh said, “it’s a death spiral for research. And the research, which is taxed at 55 percent by the university, is a source of funding for the university.” Dunleavy’s spending cuts were part of an attempt to make good on a campaign promise: to increase the state’s Permanent Fund Dividend—the checks sent to residents each year from royalties the state collects from the oil industry. The amount typically ranged from $1,000 to $2,000 per person, but that was reduced by former Gov. Bill Walker as he sought to cover a budget deficit. The unpopular move may have been the nail in the coffin of his re-election campaign. Dunleavy promised $3,000 for each resident if elected. Halfway through Dunleavy’s first year in office, that promise comes at a steep cost. The cuts to the university were among several budget cuts Dunleavy made using his veto power that will undermine key social services across Alaska—from Medicaid to help for the elderly and homeless. But the university system took the biggest hit. Those cuts have sent residents into the streets in protest and inspired a flood of letters to local newspapers. An attempt by the legislature to overrule Dunleavy’s veto failed, and lawmakers have been scrambling to find another way to restore funding. As the university struggles to re-imagine itself at a much smaller scale, it is weighing options like shuttering one of the campuses or the community colleges, or consolidating academic programs. It’s unclear if or how it will retain its reputation as a top university for Arctic research. While the majority of its research projects are funded by federal grants, they aren’t executed in a vacuum. The state funds cover other necessities, such as administrative positions and classroom costs for coursework, which graduate students are required to complete. And with so much of the university’s future in doubt, it’s unclear how it will be able to recruit and retain faculty and students. “These cuts, even if they don’t all stick, they have sent a message to the university community, the people who might attend the university, and the professors who might move on,” said Fran Ulmer, the chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and former Chancellor of the University of Alaska Anchorage. “As a former university administrator, I’m so sad about this decision by the governor.” Vladimir Romanovsky, a leading permafrost researchers who has been at the university since",

President Donald Trump‘s staff was interested in hearing more from his group, made up of conservative environmentalists from 130 college campuses. Backer co-founded the coalition soon after Trump took office out of frustration with the absence of a Republican agenda on environmental issues—particularly on climate change. This week, Backer had a seat in the East Room of the White House for a carefully orchestrated ode to Trump’s self-proclaimed environmental achievements. Did Backer find Trump’s speech and the chorus of praise from his political appointees convincing? Not entirely.

Before, there was no conversation from the president on these issues, except for the occasional climate denial quote.” “We’ve constantly told them this is something they’ve got to focus on,” Backer said. The White House event on Monday was one of several recent signs that Trump and his advisers are, indeed, trying to paint a new green sheen onto an administration that has abandoned climate action and is still working relentlessly to roll back protections for clean air, water and land. The White House reportedly has also put on indefinite hold a long-planned “red team-blue team” debate of climate science that was being organized by the most virulent science deniers among the president’s advisers. “We take climate change seriously,” Andrew Wheeler, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a National Press Club address in June, just before his agency scrapped the Obama administration’s rules to reduce carbon emissions from power plants.

His abrupt departure comes as a congressional committee investigates his contacts with former clients. Just last week, Wehrum helped unveil a signature achievement of that deregulatory drive—the repeal of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan and its replacement with a set of weak rules that will do little to curb carbon emissions. As Wehrum steps down, the agency is bracing itself to defend that rollback in the courts.

    "content": "President Donald Trump’s new order to cut the number of government advisory committees by a third is drawing condemnation from former government officials, scientists and environmental advocacy groups who say the committees provide a check against politically inspired regulatory reversals. “It’s just another extension of this administration’s attack on science, an attack on transparency, and an attack on anything that can get in the way of this administration doing what it wants to do without need for experts to intervene in any way,” said Gina McCarthy, who led the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration and is now director of Harvard University’s Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The order, issued Friday, requires each agency to abolish at least one-third of its current advisory committees by the end of September. The panels offer agencies scientific and other expert or independent advice on a variety of subjects and sometimes include representatives of the public, industry and interest or advocacy groups. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Trump’s order targets committees whose work the administration deems “obsolete” or whose costs it decides are “excessive in relation to the benefits to the Federal Government,” but it doesn’t limit the cuts to those criteria. There are currently approximately 1,000 advisory committees, including roughly 200 science advisory committees that advise the administration on issues including nuclear waste storage, ozone depletion, schools, highways, housing and the opioid epidemic. The executive order aims to reduce the number of committees to 350 by blocking the formation of new committees until this lower number is met. Committees are typically limited to two-year charters and are subject to annual review by the GSA.

    "content": "Worsening climate change will increase the risk of future violent conflict within countries, a group of top researchers representing an array of viewpoints said Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature. The study, “Climate as a risk factor for armed conflict,” tries to address some longstanding disagreements among climate scientists, political scientists, historians and other experts about what role, if any, climate change has played in internal conflicts over the last 100 years. Stanford researchers took the unusual step of convening 11 of the most experienced and cited experts on the topic to resolve their assessments of climate change’s impact on global security. Working together, the experts concluded that climate change so far has not played a large role in stoking conflict, overshadowed instead by other factors such as poor governance and weak economic development. But they agreed that climate change will play a far greater role in destabilizing countries as the planet warms. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. There was “strong agreement that the risks go up with more climate change,” said Katharine Mach, director of the Stanford Environment Assessment Facility and the lead author of the study in a video supplement to the report. “But some of the biggest uncertainties are how and why.” Rather than wars between nations, the Stanford study focused on internal conflicts, because there have been far more of them in modern history, killing anywhere from dozens of people to hundreds of thousands, Mach said. Still, domestic armed clashes, which include genocide and civil war, often spill beyond borders and destabilize entire regions. The relationship between climate change and armed conflict, even when confined to one country, is complicated, and it’s hard to tease apart the effects of extreme weather from other factors that push a society toward violence. But U.S. military and intelligence agencies have long considered climate change to be a “threat multiplier,” the factor that could tip into violence those states already staggering under the weight of other problems. For instance, a drought exacerbated by climate change in a country where the government fails to provide for its people, water is already scarce and relations between tribes and communities are fraught could lead to local clashes over water and, ultimately, broader internal conflict.

    "date": "2019-06-06T13:52:20-04:00",
    "content": "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler vowed on Wednesday to make greater use of the agency’s official board of science advisers. But soon after he spoke, some of those advisers and other outside experts protested that the agency was instead limiting their role. Wheeler took the unusual step of addressing the first meeting in a year of the Science Advisory Board (SAB), a group of advisers established by law who should be holding six to eight meetings annually, according to its charter. The reason he was there, Wheeler said, was to show his commitment to a better process. “I’m glad to be here to lay out a new direction for how EPA interacts with and uses the SAB,” he said. “I will be the first to admit we have not utilized you the way that we should. We can and we will do better.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The Science Advisory Board has become a center of controversy as President Donald Trump‘s administration has sought to remake the federal agencies. Researchers who receive EPA grant money have been barred from serving on the board, while several industry consultants and contrarian scientists have been brought aboard. Although some holdovers remain from previous administrations, Trump-era appointees now make up a large portion of the 44-member body. Some of them are known for their outlying views beyond the prevailing scientific consensus, or for representing the interests of regulated businesses. Noting the lengthy vetting process for appointees, Wheeler said, “Why should we have talented public servants go through all of that only to use you sparingly? Today we are beginning the transition to a new process. It’s no secret that the process was broken, and was not beneficial to the EPA, the board, or the public we all serve.” But some members of the board parried with Wheeler and other EPA officials at the meeting over exactly what part of the process is broken—the advisory process, or how the Trump administration is proceeding with a deregulatory agenda that gives less weight to some of the science that has guided the agency for years. One SAB member who is a holdover from before Trump, Steven Hamburg, chief scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund, asked Wheeler why the Science Advisory Board had not had an opportunity to weigh in on some of the latest science in the agency’s repeal of the Obama administration’s regulations on control of methane emissions from oil and gas operations. The SAB raised concerns over that proposal when it met a year ago, and it had an opportunity to confer with another group of outside EPA experts, the Clean Air Science Advisory Committee, but Hamburg said their focus was more on technology than science. EDF, an environmental group, has been involved in a number of large scientific studies on the extent of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released by the oil and gas industry. Wheeler said that in the future, he hoped to involve the Science Advisory Board earlier in the process—soon after proposals are made public, but he couldn’t change what happened in the past. “The one you cite—I’m sorry, it’s too late in the regulatory process,” Wheeler said. “I can’t go back and reopen some of the regulations we’ve already done.” The agency finished taking public comment on its methane proposal last December, but has not yet finalized a rule.

    "title": "Carbon Pricing Reaches U.S. House’s Main Tax-Writing Committee",
    "date": "2019-05-16T07:50:00-04:00",
    "content": "A coalition of business and environmental groups, working with the support of some major oil companies, took a carbon pricing plan to the U.S. House’s main tax-writing committee on Wednesday. It was the Ways and Means Committee’s first climate-related hearing in a dozen years, and members of both parties treated the topic with kid gloves. For the panel to be talking at all about climate change is momentous—it signals that carbon taxing has moved into the realm of the possible. But members were cautious to avoid endorsing any specific idea. The Democrats, now in control of the House, weren’t there to back any particular legislative plan, but they called the group to make its pitch as part of an effort to explore “the economic and health consequences of climate change.” Committee Republicans, meanwhile, sought to convey serious concern about the costs of global warming, even though they opposed any solution that included a tax. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “Our plan is not a carbon tax. It is a dividend,” said Ted Halstead, chairman and CEO of the Climate Leadership Council, a group whose members include BP, Exxon, and ConocoPhillips, as well as The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Federation and World Resources Institute. Halstead called the proposal a “grand bargain” for the companies, in which they accept an escalating fee on the carbon emissions they produce in exchange for a rollback of regulations on greenhouse gases. The plan, developed by GOP luminaries including former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz, would return all revenue to U.S. households in the form of dividends. The quarterly payments, which the group estimates would amount to $2,000 a year for a family of four, would outstrip the increased cost of energy for the vast majority of households. “I think there is a unified voice coming from corporate America, which is that a price on carbon is the most cost-effective solution,” Halstead said. “There are two approaches to solve climate change—you can regulate or you can price carbon. The members of our coalition, including the fossil fuel members, by joining our effort are saying they would prefer a high price on carbon in exchange for regulatory certainty.” Persuading members of the House Ways and Means Committee will be crucial for any carbon pricing initiative, since any congressional bill that raises revenue has to start here. Republicans on the committee, for the most part, did not dispute the need for climate solutions, nor did they take issue with witnesses who spoke on the science of climate change or the health risks. But they maintained that lack of affordable energy for air conditioning was as great a risk factor as more frequent heat waves, and they expressed aversion to any solution that raised energy prices—even if the revenue were returned to households. Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said he believed that regulation and carbon pricing were not the only possible solutions. “I believe there’s a third lever—that’s disruptive technology,” he said. Schweikert said he believed that, in the long term, carbon dividends would be self-defeating, noting the resemblance to the dividends households receive in Alaska for oil extraction in the state. “You might get a misincentive, and actually build a constituency for more carbon, because ‘I want my dividend,'” he said. He said he instead favored a policy like the expansion of tax credits for carbon capture technology that Congress passed last year. Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) said he also favored policies like tax credits to incentivize technological breakthroughs in greenhouse gas reduction, pointing to a bill he sponsored in the last Congress to provide tax credits for technologies that don’t currently receive them. “I’m here as a proud Republican who recognizes that climate change needs to be addressed,” Reed said. “As a proud Republican, I think that unleashing the power of the market should be our top priority. We need to lead the world by our innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.” Economic experts believe that some sort of carbon pricing will be needed to drive innovations for reining in climate change, since currently, the societal costs of greenhouse gases are not included in the price consumers pay and there is little market incentive to cut emissions. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said that some of the assertions from the GOP members of the committee betray their lack of urgency. “I listen to this happy talk about progress, and no acknowledgement of the terrible impacts of climate change getting worse, or the Trump administration’s concerted effort to make it still worse,” he said. Still, some committee members saw reason for optimism. Less than a year ago, the House—then controlled by the Republicans—had passed a resolution denouncing the idea of a U.S. carbon tax, calling it detrimental to the economy. “When there’s a problem, the first thing is that everybody’s got to agree there’s a problem, and that’s not always how it happens in Congress,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), whose district has been ravaged by wildfires. “This is the first time since I’ve been on this committee that we have all the witnesses—both Democratic and Republican—agree that climate change is real and climate change is a problem. I think this is a very important step forward.” The Climate Leadership Council’s Baker-Shultz proposal so far has no sponsor, although the group has a goal of getting a proposal introduced this year. A different carbon fee-and-dividend plan—one that includes less regulatory rollback and a more sharply increasing carbon fee—is awaiting action by the Ways and Means Committee. That bill was introduced by Florida Reps. Ted Deutch, a Democrat, and Francis Rooney, a Republican, and is backed by the grassroots advocacy group Citizens Climate Lobby, whose supporters were out in full force at the hearing and in a live chat on YouTube as the hearing was under way. Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform also weighed in online, fiercely opposing any carbon pricing plan. “Revenue-neutral does not mean that you raise taxes by $2 trillion and then send people green energy welfare apology checks,” wrote Paul Blair, ATR’s director of strategic initiatives, in the hearing chat. “That’s a massive tax and spending scheme.” That’s just a hint of the opposition carbon pricing will face from the ideological right on Capitol Hill, despite seeming growing support from the business community. Next week, CEOs and other top officials from 75 large companies, including Microsoft, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Pepsi and Mars, are slated to come to Capitol Hill to make a push for carbon pricing. But Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), sponsor of a carbon cap-and-dividend bill that also is awaiting action by the House Ways and Means Committee, said his office is far more likely to hear from businesses seeking tax breaks than seeking carbon pricing. “The business community needs to be serious about this,” Beyer said. “We know what it’s like when the business community is invested in something, and the urgency isn’t there on climate change.” Turning to Halstead, Beyer said that carbon pricing won’t advance in Congress without support of businesses like those that say they support the Climate Leadership Council’s plan. “Be serious about carbon pricing and come and knock on the doors of all 43 of us to make sure we support a carbon pricing bill,” said Beyer. “There’s going to be a hesitancy on the part of our Ways and Means Committee and the general Congress to vote for something that’s a fee, that could be characterized as a tax, that could put us at risk in the next election. Having the cover of the corporations will be really, really essential.” Read this next: Carbon Tax Plans: How They Compare and Why Oil Giants Support One of Them Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "Global warming has been fueling droughts since the early 20th Century, when soils started drying out at the same time across parts of North and Central America, Eurasia, Australia and the Mediterranean, new research shows. The researchers say the surprising early-century findings provide the clearest signal yet that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions have been changing the hydroclimate in ways that can devastate agriculture, health and livelihoods. In a climate unaltered by greenhouse gases, droughts in different parts of the world would be caused by different influences at different times. In the Southwestern United States, for example, the El Niño-La Niña cycle is a big driver of drought, while the Mediterranean region is sensitive to cyclical changes in the Atlantic Ocean’s winds and currents. But in the first half of the 20th Century, something different was starting to happen. Soil moisture decreased across all those areas at the same time—a nearly unmistakable sign that it was driven by rising global temperatures, the study’s authors said. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The global warming fingerprint on droughts is subtle but unmistakable, said Kate Marvel, the study’s lead author and a climate scientist with NASA and Columbia University. “What we’re seeing is very suggestive of a role for greenhouse gases, bigger than anything we’ve seen previously,” Marvel said. “We’re not arguing here that there is a really large effect. What we’re saying is, we’re picking out the underlying note against the background of a symphony. That note is faint but it’s definitely there. And to find it, you need to look at long-term trends and wide areas.” That’s why a global warming signal doesn’t always show up in short-term regional droughts, like the",

    "date": "2019-04-25T22:48:48-04:00",
    "content": "This story has been updated with EPA’s response. President Donald Trump’s administration has launched yet another attempt to control the use of science in federal policymaking—this time with a memorandum to government agencies from the White House budget office. The memo, quietly released on Wednesday, appears aimed at putting into effect some long-sought goals of industry foes of environmental regulations. Described as “guidance” for executive branch agencies, it offers numerous new avenues for regulated industries to challenge the science used in policymaking. The memo was signed by Russell Vought, a former top official at the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation who is now acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Observers say the OMB is seeking to implement by fiat restrictions on environmental and health science that have failed to garner support in Congress and have foundered in a formal rulemaking process begun last year by the Environmental Protection Agency. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “There’s been no consultation with the scientific community, no opportunity to comment, no analysis on the costs or impacts,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Vought’s memo, titled “Improving Implementation of the Information Quality Act,” sets out new guidance for all federal agencies on identifying and using “influential scientific, financial, or statistical information.” It says that such data should be held to higher standards than other information, with a more in-depth peer review required. That review should evaluate “the objectivity of the underlying data and the sensitivity of the agency’s conclusions to analytic assumptions,” with additional peer review required in some circumstances. Data of this kind, such as health surveys, are often used to support controls on pollutants, including those like smog and soot that come from burning fossil fuels. The guidance could also affect how limits on greenhouse gas emissions are devised. Vought writes that influential analysis must be disseminated to the public “with sufficient descriptions of data and methods to allow them to be reproduced by qualified third parties who may want to test the sensitivity of agency analyses.” The OMB memo appears aimed at achieving the same goals as EPA’s proposal last year, the so-called “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science” rule, which sought to prevent the EPA from relying on public health studies where the raw data had not been made public due to confidentiality concerns. It mirrored legislation sponsored by former Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), then chairman of the House Science Committee, that was passed by the House of Representatives three times but never been taken up by the Senate. Under the guise of transparency, the EPA rule would have excluded from environmental policymaking some of the seminal studies linking air pollution to increased mortality. The EPA received more than 500,000 public comments on the transparency proposal, including an extraordinary outpouring of opposition from the scientific community—including the presidents of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine; the leaders of physicians’ groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics; health organizations like the American Lung Association; and the editors of major scientific journals. No further public action has occurred on the rule since the comment period closed last August. An EPA spokesperson said in an email that the agency “is considering the new OMB memorandum as we move forward with the ‘Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science’ rulemaking.” It is not clear exactly what impact the OMB guidance will have—in part because this kind of guidance doesn’t have the force and effect of law. (In other words, the requirements and deadlines of environmental statutes would weigh more heavily before a judge.) Also, Vought does not specify what the EPA or other agencies are to do about influential scientific studies that do not meet the new requirements. But Rosenberg said it appears to offer the regulated industry new avenues to challenge actions that rely on science. “It’s about delay,” said Rosenberg. “Every piece of this allows industry to make a claim that will delay the process of regulations. “It essentially says that anyone—mostly industry—can challenge the data or technical information, and the agency then has to develop a response to every challenge, and then the person who challenged the data can appeal, and you have to go through this cycle again, apparently endlessly.” Vought, known as a conservative firebrand who served as an aide to Vice President Mike Pence when Pence was a member of Congress, played a key role in the budget controversies that engulfed the White House early this year. He reportedly designed Trump’s initial proposal for border wall funding and led the decision to continue processing tax refunds during the government shutdown. Vought’s memo on information quality portrays the new guidance as a good government measure. “Prudent decision making depends on reliable, high-quality information,” Vought wrote. “Congress has long recognized that federal agencies should make decisions using the best data reasonably available, and Congress has entrusted OMB with the statutory role of ensuring that federal agencies collect, use, and disseminate information that is fit for its intended purpose.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2019-03-26T23:25:00-04:00",
    "content": "This story was updated March 26 with the Senate floor debate and vote. Before U.S. lawmakers had even come up with the details of the Green New Deal, they faced a vote on it Tuesday in the Senate. It was a procedural vote—a preemptive roll call engineered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in an attempt to embarrass the Democrats and tamp down talk of climate policy. Democrats, in turn, tried to use the occasion to highlight the GOP’s inaction on climate change. That set the stage for a highly partisan, often substance-free squabble before the first vote the Senate has taken in 11 years related to a proposed climate solution. Ultimately, 57 senators—including three Democrats—voted against moving forward with consideration of the resolution, while 43 Democrats voted “present,” leaving the measure dead for the time being, without ever coming officially to the floor. Here is a guide to the maneuvers, the squabble and what McConnell hoped to gain. First, this was not the non-binding Green New Deal resolution introduced by Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Feb. 7. Instead, this was a version that McConnell himself introduced, and it was a binding resolution. Instead of voting on whether “it is the sense of the Senate” that the government has a duty to create a Green New Deal, senators would have been skipping ahead to vote on whether the Green New Deal should become “the policy of the United States,” without so much as a hearing. Under Senate rules, making it binding was the only way McConnell could hold a show vote without the usual process of assigning the legislation to the appropriate committees for discussion and debate. That would put a public spotlight on experts testifying and debate over climate solutions, something McConnell is seeking to avoid. Technically, the Senate voted on whether to end debate on McConnell’s motion to proceed to consideration of his version of a Green New Deal resolution. This “cloture” vote wasn’t on the substance of the Green New Deal. Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called McConnell’s maneuver “a cynical ploy to undermine the Green New Deal by calling a vote for a resolution he does not even support.” McConnell’s aim was to force Democrats to declare on the record either support for or opposition to the Green New Deal. He was betting there would be enough of a split to demonstrate discord among the Democrats on climate change, an issue that has become a rallying cry for their party. His barb was aimed especially at the six Democratic senators who are running for president—all of whom have signed on as co-sponsors of Markey’s Green New Deal resolution. In McConnell’s view, they were trapped into a no-win choice of showing that their support of the Green New Deal is lukewarm or conditional, or throwing their weight behind it wholeheartedly at the risk of alienating the moderate voters they’ll need to win over in",

    "date": "2019-02-15T21:16:00-05:00",
    "content": "When soot from fossil fuel combustion and wildfires drifts onto the Arctic ice and snow, it helps feed a spiraling cycle of warming, melting ice and rising sea level. New research carried out at remote locations across the Arctic shows that most of the soot—also known as black carbon—is coming from fossil fuel sources such as coal power plants, cars and trucks and factories. The findings could help countries begin to control this climate pollutant. “Some people think it’s biofuels and wildfires, but our main takeaway is that fossil fuels are the main source of black carbon in the Arctic,” said Patrik Winiger of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the lead author of a study published today in the journal Science Advances. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. His team found that about 70 percent of the black carbon in the Arctic currently comes from fossil fuel burning in Northern countries. They tracked changes in black carbon levels in the atmosphere through the seasons over five years and used chemical analyses to determine the pollution’s origins. During winters, they found that emissions from fossil fuel burning made up the majority of black carbon accumulations. During the summer, when overall black carbon concentrations are lower, emissions from wildfires and agricultural burning were bigger sources. The Arctic region is warming between two and three times faster than the world as a whole. Changes there, from the loss of sea ice to the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and mountain glaciers, can affect the entire planet. Past studies have suggested that black carbon is responsible for as much as a quarter of Arctic warming. The exact role of black carbon in the rate of warming and melting in the Arctic is still being scrutinized, and it’s important to understand, said Scott Denning, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who wasn’t involved in the new study. Black carbon typically stays aloft for only a few days to weeks before falling. While airborne, it is a short-lived climate pollutant that is many times more potent than carbon dioxide at warming the atmosphere, though it has a far shorter lifespan. While it is suspended high in the atmosphere, it can also block sunlight, and some research suggests that soot from wildfires can interfere with the formation of rainstorms. Once it falls, black carbon darkens the surface of the ice and snow, where it absorbs energy from sunlight. That can cause melting on the surface while also reducing how well the ice reflects solar radiation back into space. The authors of the new study determined that most of the black carbon that reached the Arctic came from the Arctic countries and parts of Europe and northern China above about 42 degrees north latitude, a line that passes along the southern edges of the U.S. states of Oregon, Michigan and New York. Previous estimates of black carbon sources were generally based on models or on spot readings from single locations, and the results varied widely, Winiger said. The new study includes observations year-around from",

    "date": "2019-02-14T10:05:00-05:00",
    "content": "The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology devoted its first hearing of the 116th Congress to exploring the wide-ranging effects of climate change and explaining the science fueling them, a discussion that revealed a subtle shift among key Republicans toward accepting the prevailing research that points to human-driven global warming. In her opening comments, committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) said that the hearing is one of multiple sessions on climate change the new Congress plans to hold in order to develop policies to address it. The committee’s move to highlight mainstream climate science is a marked break from the last six years when it was led by Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, an ardent climate denier from Texas who retired. The committee’s new top Republican, Rep. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, staked out a more pragmatic and less provocative position than Smith and many other conservatives in Congress had. “Droughts and heat waves come and go naturally, but the changing climate has intensified their impacts,” Lucas said in his opening remarks. “We know the climate is changing and that global industrial activity has played a role in this phenomenon. But our communities, like the farmers and ranchers in my district, need to know more about the extent to which a changing climate affects short- and long-term weather patterns.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Under Lucas, the committee’s minority side invited as its expert Joseph Majkut, who holds a doctorate in atmospheric science and is director of climate policy at the bipartisan Niskanen Center. Majkut adheres to broadly accepted climate science, unlike some GOP-invited speakers in the past. During the question-and-answer period, Majkut quashed fringe theories that a few members floated about climate change as handily as the scientists invited by the Democrats did. Democrats on the committee welcomed the change in approach by the ranking GOP member. “For years, too often we found ourselves wasting time with non-technical witnesses about whether it’s a matter of scientific debate whether or not it would be a good thing if the Greenland Ice Sheet melted,” said Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), a physicist. “I was really thrilled to see some of the changes appearing in this committee. I’d also like to thank Ranking Member Lucas and my Republican colleagues for selecting Dr. Majkut as their witness for this hearing. He’s someone with a Ph.D. in a relevant science and someone with views which are inside the scientific mainstream and that’s refreshing.” Not every minority member on the committee followed Lucas’s lead. Some of the older members, such as Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), relied on the old climate denying argument that, because other factors besides human activity caused warming 21,000 years ago, those are the factors driving changes now. (They’re not.) Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) brought up a period of warming in Greenland that was followed by a harsh freeze about 1,000 years ago, in an effort to prompt the expert panel to say that global warming might be a good thing. Majkut, the GOP-invited expert, demurred. “What we do know is we built our society around the temperatures that we’ve encountered over the last 200, 300 years,” he said, “We’re fixing to change those temperatures quite a bit, and that rapid transition is the cause for concern.” In her written testimony, Kristie Ebi, an expert witness and director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at University of Washington, highlighted the vulnerability some populations have to heat by mentioning that more than 700 children died from",

    "content": "With Democrats now in charge, two key committees in the U.S. House of Representatives used their first hearings of the year on Wednesday to press for more vigorous action on climate change, despite the political and practical hurdles. Democrats and their witnesses, including governors, policy experts and scientists, argued that time is alarmingly short. But it became clear over the hours that if the stakes are high, the odds are long. In the simultaneous hearings, the minority Republicans seized the moment to bash the so-called Green New Deal, a legislative platform that has been embraced by brash new Congress members as well as seasoned climate hawks. It seeks a rapid, wholesale transformation to a zero-carbon economy that would also be prosperous and equitable. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. One hearing, held by a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was the first in several years by that panel to consider prospective legislation on climate change. The House Natural Resources Committee said its hearing was the start of a month-long series by the full committee and its subcommittees. Lawmakers noted that President Donald Trump made no mention of the climate crisis during his State of the Union address the night before and that he instead boasted of oil and gas production.

    "date": "2019-02-07T22:00:48-05:00",
    "content": "The backers of a Green New Deal introduced a resolution in Congress on Wednesday to launch an all-out, decade-long mobilization aimed at transforming the economy to carbon-free energy. They said their radically ambitious goal would restore America’s global leadership on climate change, build national prosperity and protect the most vulnerable. The non-binding joint resolution, initially sponsored by Democratic House newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Democratic Senate veteran Edward Markey of Massachusetts, has already become an instant political sensation. Embraced by a coalition of environmental and social justice activists, the idea is also questioned by many in the energy and climate policy establishment. Scorned by influential Republicans and powerful industry lobbyists, it has been endorsed by several early Democratic presidential candidates, including co-sponsors Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren(D-Mass.). Ocasio-Cortez’s political mentor, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has not yet announced whether he will make another presidential run, also is a co-sponsor. “This is an incredible moment,” said Markey at a news conference. “Never have the interests of all Americans been as united on a single issue. From the air we breathe, to the jobs that employ us, to the neighborhoods we live in, to the economy we operate in, climate change defines our existence.” In an era when global warming and financial inequality are both setting records, Markey said the Green New Deal was an effort to address not only “the erosion of our coastlines,” but also “the erosion of the earning power of workers.” Ocasio-Cortez seemed to respond to critics who have called the plan unworkable or unrealistic. “Climate change and our environmental challenges are one of the biggest existential threats to our way of life—not just as a nation, but as a world. In order for us to combat that threat, we have to be as ambitious and innovative as possible,” she said. Ocasio-Cortez seized on the Green New Deal while campaigning last year. Days after her election, she participated in a sit-in during the lame duck session of Congress, when she joined activists who crowded the office of Nancy Pelosi, then still the minority leader. On Monday, House Speaker Pelosi appointed Democratic members to a new climate advisory committee, and said this resolution is just one among many ideas the committee might ponder. “The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is but they’re for it, right?” she said in an interview with Politico. At a press conference, the sponsors shrugged that off. “I think it is a green dream,” said Ocasio-Cortez with a smile. Markey said there was “no bigger champion” on climate than Pelosi, who helped him pass a landmark bill in",

    "date": "2019-02-12T15:32:00-05:00",
    "content": "An international agreement to reduce the use of potent greenhouse gases in air conditioning and refrigeration went into effect this year, with more than 60 countries ratifying it. U.S. manufacturers say the agreement could create tens of thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in U.S. exports—and that failing to join will hurt U.S. industry. More than a dozen Republican senators and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have supported it, and a State Department official said over a year ago that the Trump administration had “initiated the process to consider U.S. ratification.” Yet the U.S. president has yet to ratify the agreement, known as the Kigali Amendment. So, what’s holding it up? The Kigali Amendment is about global warming. That may help explain the delay, said George David Banks, who has some insight after advising Presidents Donald Trump and George W. Bush on climate policy. The amendment expands the existing ozone-saving Montreal Protocol to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), short-lived climate pollutants that are more potent than carbon dioxide over the short term. And as Banks explained: “If you acknowledge the problem, then you have to do something about it.” Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, sees another connection—to the Obama administration’s support for the measure. “President Trump sees something that is inherited from President Obama, he has to get over that hurdle,” Zaelke said. “Then he sees it’s an environmental issue, he has to get over that.” It’s also a multilateral international agreement, and Trump has reflexively opposed international efforts, often arguing that they aren’t in U.S. economic interests. “They have made it clear that they have not been supportive of multilateral agreements,” said Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, a refrigeration and air conditioning industry group that formed in the",

    "title": "Michigan’s New Governor Puts Climate Change at Heart of Government",
    "date": "2019-02-05T08:50:00-05:00",
    "content": "Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan signed orders on Monday to revamp the state’s environmental policy apparatus, becoming the latest newly elected Democratic leader in an industrial swing state to pick up the reins of action on climate change. Whitmer is creating a new office of climate and energy that will coordinate efforts across state government to address climate change and will ensure that climate change is a consideration in the vetting of new policies. She also signed an order to join the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of governors who commit to upholding the principles of the Paris climate agreement. Michigan is the 20th governor to join, following similar actions by others who came to power after running green campaigns and toppling Republican incumbents. In the past few weeks, the governors of Illinois and New Mexico have also joined. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Michigan stood out as a fulcrum of Donald Trump’s narrow electoral victory. It’s an economic monument to the internal combustion engine, but also a place where the urgency of confronting environmental challenges, including climate change, can’t be ignored. “We see this as part of a larger trend we’re seeing across the country with new governors who ran on climate, who ran on transitions to 100 percent clean energy,” said Sara Jordan, manager of the League of Conservation Voters’ Clean Energy for All campaign. “I think you’re seeing a lot of these governors not wanting to be left behind in this transition.” Pam Kiely, director of state climate policy for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the flurry of activity at the state level is tied to widespread frustration with the Trump administration’s deregulatory agenda. “We are at a moment in time when state leadership is not going to wait for the climate crisis to be solved in Washington,” she said. A few other states have climate change offices, including California and New York. The full list of changes Whitmer announced is long, and most of the new functions and offices will be part of an expanded Department of Environmental Quality, which is now renamed the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. This includes three other new offices: Office of the Environmental Justice Public Advocate, the Interagency Environmental Justice Response Team, and the Clean Water Public Advocate. Each of these touch on the fallout from the lingering lead poisoning crisis in Flint, and a desire to better address these kinds of problems. For now, the new offices will need to ramp up with existing state employees, because this type of order does not come with additional funding. Both chambers of the legislature are dominated by Republicans. Whitmer also is eliminating advisory panels that gave businesses a prominent voice in how state environmental rules and permits were handled. The panels were created by her Republican predecessor, Rick Snyder, and criticized by environmental advocates. Whitmer said at a news conference that her actions communicate “that we take this very seriously, that we make decisions based on science and that we are going to do everything we can to mitigate human impacts that are warming the globe and changing our climate forever.” She said the urgency to act is underscored by the wild swings in weather the state has seen in the last week. The daytime high was more than 50 degrees in Lansing on Monday, well above normal for this time of year. “I know you all remember that just five days ago we had a wind chill of negative 52 in the Upper Peninsula,” she said. Erratic and extreme weather can be exacerbated by climate change and can threaten the state’s economy, she said. The National Climate Assessment describes several more risks that climate change poses to the Midwest region, including to the Great Lakes, forests, agriculture, infrastructure and human health. While extreme cold was the experience last week, extreme heat is a larger concern, as outlined in a new report on Michigan’s climate risks from the Natural Resources Defense Council. The report also points to flooding and the spread of mosquito- and tick-borne infections, both of which can be exacerbated by climate change. Most of the climate-related problems touching Michigan are also affecting other Great Lakes states. Whitmer is one of a new crop of governors in those states, most whom are pledging to make climate a high priority. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "In Florida, a New Governor Shifts Gears on Environment, and Maybe Climate Change",
    "date": "2019-01-28T08:50:00-05:00",
    "content": "Florida’s new Republican governor has moved quickly on a number of environmental priorities, but so far, he has stopped short of any comprehensive plan to cut greenhouse gas pollution. That’s a gaping hole, say environmental advocates, but they give him credit where they say it’s due. Several of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ early environmental directives are aimed at cleaning up water and helping Florida adapt to the effects of global warming, including more intense hurricanes and sea level rise that threatens to swallow parts of the state in the coming decades. He called for appointing chief science officer to coordinate scientific research, and he staked an opposition to fracking and offshore oil and gas activities. But there’s no clear call for reducing the pollution that causes global warming, and climate advocates are waiting to see who that chief science officer will be. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Some environmental advocates say it appears that DeSantis, a former congressman and Navy lawyer, is at least willing to listen to scientists on environmental and climate issues. That would be a sharp turn from the last eight years under the administration of Republican Rick Scott, they said. DeSantis “has set up an office of science, and he talks about how he wants science to drive decisions,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “Those things together force you to have to confront the fact that there are things the state and local governments can do not only on the adaptation side, but also in the mitigation side.” “This guy is clearly cut from a different cloth than Rick Scott,” Smith said. As governor, Scott, who now represents Florida in the U.S. Senate, was seen by many as indifferent or hostile to concerns about the climate in a state with a lot to lose from global warming. Early on, his administration had an unwritten policy banning the terms climate change and global warming, according to the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting, and he stopped work on a statewide climate action plan that had been launched by his then-Republican predecessor Charlie Crist. The environment has become a prominent issue in Florida, including during the last election. On the Gulf Coast, a toxic red tide algae burned beachgoers eyes and lungs and killed manatees by the dozens. In Lake Okeechobee and on the Atlantic Coast, rancid blooms of toxic blue-green algae prompted health warnings to stay out of the water. Hurricane Michael, fueled by the overly warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, exploded from almost nothing to Category 4 strength in just three days, devastating communities in the Panhandle. DeSantis shied away from talking about the causes of climate change during the race, while his Democratic opponent, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, called for embracing “a plan to transition Florida to clean energy as rapidly as possible.” DeSantis narrowly won. Within a week of taking office this month, DeSantis signed an executive order that included measures aimed at improving water quality. “Gov. DeSantis knows the protection of Florida’s water resources is one of the most pressing issues facing our state, and that’s why issuing this executive order was one of his first actions upon taking office,” a statement provided by the governor’s media office said. But the order also went beyond water quality with its science and resilience directives, including telling Florida’s Department of Environmental Protection to ensure its decisions are based on the best available science and ordering the creation of an Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection to help communities prepare for the effects of sea level rise. It also told state regulators to oppose the natural gas drilling practice known as hydraulic fracturing and to fight offshore oil and gas activities, even beyond state waters where drilling is already banned. The swiftness of the governor’s moves caught many people by surprise, said Cynthia Barnett, a Florida-based author and environmental fellow at the University of Florida’s Bob Graham Center for Public Service. “Floridians seemed to be shocked, and it wasn’t that we haven’t seen a Republican champion environmental issues,” she said. “But the speed of Gov. DeSantis’ actions came as a surprise.” Still, some environmental advocates are wary. “What’s missing is anything to actually curb carbon emissions,” said Jonathan Webber, deputy director of Florida Conservation Voters, which works to elect environmentally minded public officials. It’s too soon to pass judgment on the governor’s environmental directives because nobody knows yet how they will be carried out, said Frank Jackalone, director of the Sierra Club Florida. For example, Floridians are still waiting to find out who will be named as the state’s chief scientist, a position charged with coordinating science policies across state government. “If it’s someone who is in the minority of scientists who is a climate change denier, then it might not accomplish its purpose,” Jackalone said. He said there’s reason to be concerned, in part because of DeSantis’s record on environmental legislation, which earned a League of Conservation Voters score of just 2 percent during his six years in Congress. During the campaign, DeSantis was non-committal on climate science, telling reporters: “I am not in the pews of the church of the global warming leftists. I am not a global warming person. I don’t want that label on me.” He suggested that climate change was a global issue for the national and international levels, rather than the state. During a press conference earlier this month, he declined to answer a reporter’s question on his climate science views. DeSantis’ press office declined to answer questions about the governor’s position on reducing heat-trapping gasses or the qualifications he’ll be seeking in a chief science officer. Webber credits DeSantis for doing “what every smart politician tries to do, which is turn a weakness into a strength. Protecting our environment is popular with all Floridians, so doing what is right is a no-brainer for a politician looking to define himself.” DeSantis made that connection in his inaugural address. “Our economic potential will be jeopardized if we do not solve the problems afflicting our environment and water resources,” he said. Florida is the nation’s third-largest state, and scientists say its growing population faces major risks from the effects of climate change, including extreme heat, drought, more potent hurricanes and worsening coastal flooding as sea level rises. The Union of Concerned Scientists last year published a report that concluded that in less than three decades, about 64,000 of today’s residential Florida properties would be at risk of chronic inundation. Local governments need a strong state partner to help them adapt, said Steve Adams, director of urban resilience for the Institute for Sustainable Communities and former energy policy advisor to Crist, who switched parties and is now a Democratic congressman. Adams helped four South Florida counties including Miami-Dade form a climate compact to work cooperatively on the climate change threats and responses, and he said he is encouraged by DeSantis’ early environmental moves. A new office of resilience could help Florida communities get the funding and technical support “in a way that hasn’t been present these lasts several years,” said Lauren Ordway, an Institute for Sustainable Communities program manager who works with the four counties to address climate change. “For many years now, our local leaders have been taking this issue exceptionally seriously,” she said. “I don’t think there is any time to waste to rolling up our sleeves and getting into action.” Webber, with Florida Conservation Voters, agreed that working on adaptation is vital, but so is emission reductions. “We don’t need to see that in the first week,” he said, “but we hope that’s coming.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

The authors also argue that areas that were not even considered by the EPA at the time—ocean acidification, increased threat of violence and risks to national security and economic well-being—should be included in the government’s assessment of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The findings are especially important as President Donald Trump’s administration rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and rolls back policies, such as stronger emissions standards for cars and power plants, that were designed to curb greenhouse gases. The endangerment finding is the legal underpinning for all of the actions on climate change taken by President Barack Obama’s EPA. Indeed, the Supreme Court ruled in",

    "content": "Increasing demand for home air conditioning driven by global warming, population growth and rising incomes in developing countries could increase the planet’s temperatures an additional half a degree Celsius by the end of the century, according to a new report by the Rocky Mountain Institute. The demand is growing so fast that a “radical change” in home-cooling technology will be necessary to neutralize its impact, writes RMI, an energy innovation and sustainability organization. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The problem with air-conditioning comes from two sources: the amount of energy used, much of which is still powered by carbon-emitting coal, oil and gas generation, and the leaking of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) coolants, which are short-lived climate pollutants many times more potent than carbon dioxide. While international agreements like the recent Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol are starting a global effort to phase down the use of HFCs, that alone won’t be enough to keep cooling from contributing to the causes of global warming and fueling a vicious circle, the report’s authors write. Air conditioning, and homes themselves, will also have to become more energy efficient. To ramp up efforts to bring down emissions from cooling, RMI joined the government of India, British entrepreneur Richard Branson and other organizations on Monday in launching the Global Cooling Prize, an effort to spur development of highly efficient cooling technology to reduce further warming from the residential air conditioning sector.

    "date": "2018-09-28T18:39:10-04:00",
    "content": "Appalachian Ohio, a region hurt by the decline of coal, may become home to one of the largest solar projects east of the Rockies. American Electric Power submitted a plan Thursday evening to work with two developers to build 400 megawatts of solar in Highland County, Ohio. It would more than triple the state’s current solar capacity and be a big step forward for solar energy in a part of the country where renewable energy has been slow to develop. AEP says the plan would save consumers $218 million over 20 years because solar power from the project would be less expensive than conventional energy sources. “This is something that Appalachia needs,” said Dan Sawmiller, Ohio energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The jobs of this renewable energy economy are going to go somewhere and I think it’s important that they go where they’re needed.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. But the project’s structure would break the established regulatory mold in Ohio, a state where utilities don’t own power plants and generators compete with each other to supply the cheapest power to the grid. The savings and the jobs promised are a turnaround from the arguments state officials listened to when they rejected clean energy proposals in recent years. If the new plan is approved by Ohio regulators, it could serve as a template for other new projects in Ohio and in other states. The decision to put the project in Appalachian Ohio, which covers the southern and eastern parts of the state, is part of an attempt to bring economic development to an economically depressed region. “It’s a really hopeful move,” said John Quigley, director of the Center for Environment, Energy and Economy at Harrisburg University, who has written about so-called “just transition” for poor communities affected by the shift from fossil fuels to the new green economy. “It’s an eye-opener for policymakers that there’s a huge economic development opportunity for solar, especially in communities negatively affected by the energy transition,” he said. Another recent example is Xcel Energy’s plan to close its coal-fired power plant in Pueblo, Colorado, and build renewable energy projects there. Highland County, Ohio, where AEP and its solar developers chose to build, has an unemployment rate higher than the state average, and nearby counties have some of the highest unemployment rates in the state. AEP says its plan would bring 3,900 new jobs, most of them in construction, plus 113 full-time jobs in solar manufacturing. Details on the manufacturing jobs were not immediately disclosed. The plan is part of a boom in solar development that is happening across the country. Some other big solar projects have also been announced in the region but not yet built, including a 150 megawatt solar farm being developed by Invenergy in Hardin County, Ohio. The AEP project would go into service in",

    "content": "The Southern Ocean around Antarctica is warming at an alarming rate—twice that of the rest of the world’s oceans. Now, researchers have developed more powerful evidence pointing to the human causes. Though warming had been observed in the past, there was little historical data to allow scientists to pinpoint the causes with much certainty. In a new study, researchers used climate models, the past observations that did exist and data flowing in from new ocean-going sensors to show how greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere have led to both a warming of the Southern Ocean and an increase in its freshwater content. The findings also rule out natural variability as a major source of those changes. “The observed warming is due to human influence,” said oceanographer Neil Swart, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada who led the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience. “That may have been suspected or proposed before, but this is the evidence that really proves it.” The Southern Ocean is notoriously inhospitable, clogged with ice and home to rough seas and weather. As a result, there weren’t many measurements in the past. In",

    "date": "2018-09-13T13:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "In response to what it sees as increasing efforts to undermine the teaching of climate science, the nation’s largest science teachers association took the unusual step Thursday of issuing a formal position statement in support of climate science education. In its position statement, the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) calls on science teachers from kindergarten through high school to emphasize to students that “no scientific controversy exists regarding the basic facts of climate change.” “Given the solid scientific foundation on which climate change science rests, any controversies regarding climate change and human-caused contributions to climate change that are based on social, economic, or political arguments—rather than scientific arguments—should not be part of a science curriculum,” it says. It also urges teachers to “reject pressures to eliminate or de-emphasize” climate science in their curriculum. And it urges school administrators to provide science teachers with professional development opportunities to strengthen their understanding of climate science. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “Now, more than ever, we really feel that educators need the support of a national organization, of their educational colleagues and their scientist colleagues, because they have encountered a lot of resistance,” David Evans, the executive director of NSTA, said. “In climate science, as in other areas, we really emphasize the importance that students learn the science in science class, and if there are controversies or other issues to deal with, we want them to have a good solid foundation in evidence-based knowledge to carry out that conversation,” he said. Judy Braus, executive director of the North American Association for Environmental Education, said her organization fully supports the NSTA position statement. “We feel that it’s important to address the misinformation that’s out there about climate” change, she said. NSTA has issued position statements in the past on topics such as safety, gender equity and the responsible use of animals in the classroom, but this is only the second focused on the teaching of subject matter that can be controversial for reasons not related to the science itself but for societal or political reasons. “Over the last five years, the two issues that have had the most controversy with them have been evolution on a continuing basis and climate change, and there has been more controversy around climate change,” Evans said. Teachers and school boards have been under pressure from organizations that oppose climate policies, including some that have promoted misinformation and aruged for climate change to be removed from state science curricula. Last year, the Heartland Institute, a conservative advocacy organization with close ties to the fossil fuel industry, mailed approximately 300,000 copies of its publication “Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming” to middle, high school and college science teachers around the country. Evans said Thursday’s position statement was not a direct response to the Heartland mailings but was precipitated by attacks on climate science curriculum that have been building since the National Research Council recommended climate science be included in K–12 science education in",

In a report released Tuesday, the GAO said the Coast Guard “did not have a sound business case” and may have underestimated both the costs and the amount of time it would take to deliver the ships. Those shortcomings could pose significant risk to the program’s success and to the United States’ presence at the poles, considering the U.S. icebreaker fleet is already on borrowed time, with just one heavy polar icebreaker that is years past its projected lifespan. The report could strike a blow at the progress being made toward acquiring new ships—a decades-long effort that is becoming increasingly important for both security and science as global temperatures rise. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Funding had seemed closer to succeeding than ever before. President Trump asked Congress for $750 million in the coming fiscal year to start the design and procurement of the new ships. But Congress hasn’t approved the spending yet. Among the competing priorities in the Homeland Security budget is the wall he wants along the U.S.-Mexico border. The GAO report isn’t a death blow. But if the program is to be shoehorned into the budget, its costs will have to be kept under control. “For those who understand the urgency and the national need for a heavy icebreaker, this will be seen as putting forward a very thoughtful argument, to make sure we’re doing best practices,” said Heather Conley, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who focuses on the Arctic. “But for those who find these costs so extraordinary, they may want to slow down and keep reviewing the program—which is the reason we don’t have the icebreakers that we need.” The Coast Guard currently has two icebreakers to fulfill its mission at the poles—the Polar Star, a heavy icebreaker built in",

    "content": "Arguing that public health and safety are at risk, researchers, health experts and administrators from leading scientific institutions across the nation have joined in opposition to a controversial Trump administration proposal that would restrict the use of science in federal policy making. As the comment period draws to a close Thursday on a plan to limit the science that the Environmental Protection Agency can use in decision-making, the scientific and academic communities are flooding the agency with letters arguing the proposal would hobble EPA and wreak havoc on research. “The proposed rule would—for no rational reason—prevent EPA from relying on much of the research that … public health and environmental exposure researchers have conducted and continue to conduct,” said one letter, organized by Harvard University, its health and medical schools and its affiliated hospitals. It was signed by Harvard President Lawrence Bacow and nearly 100 other administrators and researchers—the first time such an array of Harvard’s most prestigious faculty have joined in opposition to any EPA proposal, according to former agency officials and observers. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The EPA proposal has long been sought by fossil fuel interests. It could be used to weaken health-based standards for limiting some of the pollution caused by burning coal, oil and natural gas, and ties in with the Trump administration’s broad attempt to roll back climate and pollution rules. But the Harvard letter, drafted by the school’s legal experts, lays out a roadmap that opponents surely will rely on to challenge the approach as illegal. They note that Congress has mandated that EPA use the “best available science” in at least a half dozen separate laws. “The rule will cripple EPA’s ability to implement [these environmental laws] and will jeopardize the health and safety of infants, children, and adults in the United States and beyond,” they wrote. The so-called “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science” proposal, also known as the “secret science” rule, would prohibit the EPA from relying on studies where raw data has not been released publicly, perhaps even including information that could reveal the identities and medical records of research subjects. That could exclude studies where participants were promised confidentiality, including some of the seminal research on environmental health threats—such as the first studies linking small particle soot pollution with increased mortality.

    "date": "2018-07-09T17:38:15-04:00",
    "content": "With Scott Pruitt’s resignation, responsibility for leading President Donald Trump’s retreat from climate action passed from an ideological fighter to a Washington political pro. But it remains to be seen whether former coal industry lobbyist and Congressional staffer Andrew Wheeler, who took the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday, will ease up at all or double down on Pruitt’s ambitious deregulatory agenda. Two things are certain: The bulk of EPA’s work lies ahead for carrying out Trump’s fossil fuel ambitions, and Wheeler is taking on the job amid unprecedented scrutiny generated by Pruitt’s ethics scandals. Even those who expect the worst from Wheeler—in terms of climate and environmental protection—expect him to tread more cautiously and quietly than his predecessor. “Pruitt just had utter contempt for government—that’s why he kept getting overturned,” said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a nonprofit advocacy group, referring to at least a half-dozen reversals of Pruitt’s actions by federal judges. “Wheeler has been part of government, he has been a lobbyist, he is ‘of the swamp.’ I think he’s going to be more careful and not as inflammatory.” “He’ll be Pruitt without the nasty smirk and the edge,” Becker said. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Supporters of Trump‘s regulatory rollback plans hope so, too. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said he was confident that Wheeler would carry out changes that were increasingly difficult for Pruitt to implement while facing more than a dozen investigations into misuse of his office. “President Trump made the right decision to accept [Pruitt’s] resignation,” Barrasso said in a prepared statement. “I know Assistant Administrator Andrew Wheeler is well prepared to continue the progress already made under President Trump.” But for the most part, Pruitt did not get further than telegraphing the blows he hoped to land against the Obama administration’s climate legacy. Amid all of the deregulatory actions by the EPA over the past year, here are the most important moves on greenhouse gas emissions begun by Pruitt that could be reshaped by Wheeler’s follow-through. On the eve of Pruitt’s resignation, the EPA finished drafting a replacement for President Barack Obama’s signature climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan, and sent it to the White House for review, The New York Times reported. The rules, designed to rein in carbon emissions from electric power plants, were a key target of an executive order Trump signed within weeks of his inauguration.

    "date": "2018-07-10T15:10:53-04:00",
    "content": "To see why environmentalists have been panicking about the new direction of the Supreme Court, just go back 11 years and read the two dissents in the landmark climate change case Massachusetts v. EPA. Not the majority opinion, where Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the fifth, swing vote compelling the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In the opening words of the ruling, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Kennedy, embraced the science of climate change. No, what sends shudders down the spines of environmental advocates is the way the deeply conservative minority saw things back then, spelled out in a pair of dissents—one written by Chief Justice John Roberts and the other by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat President Donald Trump filled last year with Neil Gorsuch. Both dissents were also joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Where would Trump’s new nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, fit into this court if he is confirmed to replace Kennedy, who is retiring? The dissents are hostile to an expansive view of EPA’s powers under the Clean Air Act, but more profoundly, they are out of step with the core scientific understanding of global warming. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. For environmentalists, it’s worrisome that the court is increasingly prone to make decisions under one of Scalia’s core beliefs, known as “textualism,” which would see no climate role for the agency in charge of protecting the environment unless it is expressly spelled out in statute. Congress, especially under the control of Republicans, doesn’t look likely to crack down on pollution from the use of fossil fuels, whatever the risks to society. And it’s a nightmare to think that a new majority on the court might turn it into a sounding board for outright climate denial. Roberts started off his dissent by stating that he would render “no judgment on whether global warming exists, what causes it, or the extent of the problem.” But his framing of the question of standing—the threshold test of whether Massachusetts and other states even had the right to press their case in court—was out of step with the science. On coastal damages from sea level rise, an eventuality that is not just a risk but a certainty, readily observed and directly caused by the warming of ocean waters and the melting of ice masses due to rising carbon dioxide, Roberts wrote: “It is pure conjecture.” As for strengthening controls on the greenhouse gas emissions from new cars, one of the main sources of carbon pollution and the focus of the litigation, their tailpipe fumes played only a “bit-part” in causing the problem, he said. His point was that to even get their day in court, plaintiffs had to prove that a specific harm to them (coastal damage) had to be right around the corner (not decades away) and had to be knotted to a single act of regulatory neglect (lax auto standards). Not even justice should be that blind. It is well established that sea level rise is just one of the myriad dangers presented to public health and the environment by the unregulated use of fossil fuels. In the context of climate science, a century is the blink of an eye. And the moment EPA ruled that CO2 was a dangerous pollutant, not only the science but the law tells the federal government to control emissions from all significant sources, not just new cars. Next, take a look at the other dissent, written by Scalia—a judge who conservatives consider the archetype for the next nominee to the high court. Most of it is taken up by Scalia’s brand of textualism, a contorted, dictionary-driven defense of the notion that man-made carbon dioxide is not even pollution. “Regulating the buildup of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, which is alleged to be causing global climate change, is not akin to regulating the concentration of some substance that is polluting the air,” he wrote. Five like-minded justices “could overturn Mass. v. EPA or, perhaps more likely, significantly curtail its reach,” said one legal scholar, Ann Carlson at the UCLA law school. “Justice Scalia had already begun to lay the groundwork for curtailing EPA’s power to regulate greenhouse gases in a subsequent case, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA,” she wrote. (There, the court upheld EPA rules on some sources, but said the agency had overreached on others.) “With a new Justice on the Court who opposes Mass. v. EPA, it isn’t hard to imagine the Court imposing significant limitations on EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases,” she went on. “If a Democrat were elected President in",

    "content": "One of the more innovative and effective efforts to convey climate information to the American public has been a project to educate and assist weather forecasters in presenting the complexities of climate science. Climate Matters, a program developed through a partnership of George Mason University, Yale University and the science and news nonprofit Climate Central, has built a network of 520 weather forecasters in 146 media markets. Climate Central’s team of data analysts, meteorologists, climate experts and graphic artists provide graphics, videos and research for TV weathercasters. Now, four Republican senators closely allied with the fossil fuel industry are challenging the government’s support of the project. That support is provided through the National Science Foundation (NSF), whose mission includes spreading understanding of scientific matters and assessing the effectiveness of science programs. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. More than 80 percent of TV weathercasters now say that human-caused climate change is happening, according to an NSF-funded study published last year. As recently as a decade ago, one study found that only 20 percent of broadcast meteorologists identified carbon dioxide as the main cause of global warming. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) don’t find that acceptable. On Monday, they called for an NSF ’s investigation into $4 million in grants to the weathercaster program. The senators said that the grants “seek to influence political and social debate rather than conduct scientific research,” and that NSF is supposed to be “a supporter of basic research beneficial to the common good.” The four senators, all of whom count the oil, gas and coal industries as among their top political funders, have been among the most vociferous climate science deniers on Capitol Hill. “It is troubling that NSF saw fit to fund this project designed to ‘recruit’ experts to a position they did not come to of their own accord as meteorologists,” the GOP senators’ letter said. “It is further troubling that the specific objective of converting meteorologists to a climate-action-oriented opinion was to show them how an unknowledgeable citizenry would be more easily convinced of the same belief.” That’s far from the objective of the program as spelled out in the description of its latest NSF grant. “A particular focus of the initiative has been to help the public become more familiar with the science behind how their local weather and its trends are related to the dynamics of the climate,” the description reads. “Many communities nationwide are engaged in deliberations about how to understand, plan for, and adapt to the potential impacts of changes in their weather on important factors pertaining to their economy and well-being, such as natural resources, natural disasters, agriculture, industry, and health,” it says. “The goal of this continuing project is to expand the quantity and nature of the coverage of such information into the news segments of local news media. By stimulating local reporting on climate impacts and their relationships to personal and community-wide decision-making, this project will potentially help millions of Americans better understand and respond to critical factors that are affecting their lives.” The NSF, established by Congress in",

    "title": "Trump’s Environmental Rollbacks Put Thousands of Lives at Risk, Harvard Analysis Finds",
    "date": "2018-06-13T20:00:30-04:00",
    "content": "Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s own numbers, two Harvard scientists have calculated that 80,000 more lives will be lost per decade if President Donald Trump’s administration fulfills its plans to roll back clean air and water protections. The researchers, terming their tally “an extremely conservative estimate,” also estimated that the repeal of regulations will lead to respiratory problems for more than 1 million people. Their essay was published Tuesday in the authoritative Journal of the American Medical Association. “We felt it was important to take a comprehensive view,” said Francesca Dominici, a biostatistician and co-director of the Data Science Initiative at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Some people, when looking at one specific repealing of a rule, might not think it’s important. We wanted to put some numbers on the whole systematic repeal of rule after rule.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. She and David Cutler, an economist at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, drew their calculation from the health risk assessments that the EPA conducted during the Obama administration when determining the impact of rules it proposed. Last week, the Trump administration signaled it plans to overhaul the way that those cost-benefit studies are conducted. The agency is taking comments for the next 30 days on its plan, which has the potential to reduce the weight given to human health and climate benefits. Dominici and Cutler decried creating greater risks to the public’s health for the benefit of “a relatively few well-connected companies.” “The effects of the Trump administration’s policies seem clear, even through the haze they will create,” they wrote. The EPA dismissed the article because it was not peer-reviewed but appeared instead in the JAMA Forum, where researchers offer perspectives. “This is not a scientific article, it’s a political article,” the EPA said in response to InsideClimate News’ request for comment. But Dominici noted that she and Cutler pulled the numbers directly from the EPA risk assessments that had been developed for each of the rules they analyzed. “The EPA numbers themselves all rely on peer-reviewed science,” Dominici said. The EPA numbers, in fact, are being challenged and in some cases scaled back by the Trump administration as it seeks to revoke or replace Obama-era rules. But these moves face numerous legal challenges, and the agency will have to show that it has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously to pass muster in the courts. It’s hard to argue against the ample evidence that if air quality standards are relaxed, the health of those who breathe the air will suffer. The same goes for standards for water, pesticides, toxic waste and so on. Runaway climate change, too, would present a wide range of public health risks. The largest and most immediate health consequences are likely to come through erosion of air quality, Cutler and Domenici wrote. They included in their calculation the repeal of President Barack Obama’s signature climate change initiative, the Clean Power Plan, as well as the rollback of vehicle fuel economy standards and Trump’s tariffs on solar power components from abroad. About 90 percent of the increase in respiratory ailments can be attributed to one deregulatory move—the effort to re-open a loophole that allowed trucks that don’t comply with pollution rules to remain on the road, the authors found. Public health scientists have been raising increasing alarms as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has advanced Trump’s deregulatory agenda. They have protested Pruitt’s move to bar government-funded scientists from sitting on the agency’s Science Advisory Board, and nearly 1,000 scientists signed a letter opposing Pruitt’s plan to place restrictions on the EPA’s use of science. In their JAMA essay, Dominici and Cutler singled out the move to curb agency use of science as one of the most potentially consequential, because Pruitt is targeting epidemiological studies of human subjects. Although Pruitt calls this a move for greater “transparency,” Dominici said it would in fact bar EPA consideration of precisely the kinds of studies that formed the basis of the calculations that she and Cutler did. “They are attacking the science because the science is what is putting the number of deaths where they are,” she said. “It’s a tactic to discredit the science, so that health impact analysis will not be able to be done any more.” The EPA, which received more than 150,000 public comments in 30 days on its proposal to restrict agency science, has extended the comment period on that proposal through August. The agency also has set a July 17 hearing in Washington, D.C., on the plan. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "A federal appeals court has dealt a setback to environmentalists trying to force the Interior Department to reconsider the climate impacts of its coal leasing program, one of the world’s biggest sources of global warming pollution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the department was under no obligation to redo the program’s environmental impact studies, which were conducted four decades ago when the science of climate change was in its infancy. But the ruling was a narrow one. The three-judge panel, in a unanimous decision written by Judge Harry Edwards, said the activists can continue to challenge individual leases on climate grounds under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), an avenue where they have met some successes in lower courts. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. At issue is one of the most disputed fossil fuel programs on public lands, especially in the West, where federal subsidies drive gigantic quantities of coal onto the market. Just before the end of the Obama administration, the Interior Department put a moratorium on new leases and announced a major reconsideration of the program’s merits, including a comprehensive new environmental impact statement that would have addressed the climate questions head on. But the Trump administration scrapped that approach as part of its full-bore attempt to salvage the coal industry, which has been collapsing in the face of environmental regulations and competition from cheaper, cleaner sources of energy. That put the coal leases back on track without any significant consideration of how the resulting emissions of carbon dioxide affect Earth’s climate. It’s a glaring problem that the Trump administration is determined to keep on the back burner, preferably of a coal-fired stove. Not only does Interior’s Bureau of Land Management continue to write leases with cursory climate assessments, the administration has canceled Obama-era instructions to agencies telling them how to comply with NEPA’s requirements when considering climate impacts. At the heart of NEPA is its requirement for a “hard look” at the broad, cumulative environmental impacts of major federal actions. But in",

    "content": "This story is part of ICN’s Southeast regional coverage. Fueled by coal-burning power plants and heavy industry, seven southeastern states produce enough carbon dioxide combined to rank as the world’s sixth-largest climate polluter, but few of the region’s larger cities are setting measurable goals for cleaning up, a new report concludes. A stellar performer was West Palm Beach, Florida. Among the worst laggards was Mobile, Alabama. Chris Ann Lunghino and her Nashville nonprofit advocacy group, Community Sustainability USA, published the report as a way to encourage more cities to reduce their carbon footprints. She worked with researchers from Vanderbilt University and South Korea’s Yonsei University. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Their report is based on a survey of the 139 cities across the region with a population of at least 50,000. It found that only about 20 percent of the cities have set emissions-reduction goals so far, but more are taking a closer look at their emissions and plan to increase their use of renewable energy. Among the findings: “Cities across population sizes and political leanings in the Southeast are setting climate goals, and some are setting aggressive climate goals, to prevent the most drastic climate change impacts,” Lunghino said. But 47 cities received a score of zero, meaning they didn’t meet any of the benchmarks the report used to gauge ambition. The rankings, called the Southeast Climate Commitment Index, examined cities in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. The index takes into account 21 indicators in categories such as whether cities have taken inventories of their greenhouse gas emissions, procured renewable energy, adopted resolutions in support of tackling climate change or pledged emissions reductions. West Palm Beach, Florida, topped all cities with the highest score. Lunghino noted it has committed to a goal of 100 percent renewable energy, set a greenhouse gas reduction target, conducted a greenhouse gas inventory and plans to do follow-up inventories.

    "title": "There’s No Power Grid Emergency Requiring a Coal Bailout, Regulators Say",
    "date": "2018-06-12T21:25:14-04:00",
    "content": "The top regulators of the nation’s power grid told Congress on Tuesday that they see no immediate national security emergency to justify propping up coal and nuclear power plants with a government order, as the Trump administration is considering. All five members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, weighed in at a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on a debate that has been roiling the industry and its regulators for months. It was the first time in many years that the whole commission had appeared before the committee together. Even though most of them were appointed by President Donald Trump, they seemed ambivalent or even hostile to his repeated attempts, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, to require grid operators to buy power from uneconomical coal and nuclear power plants. Trump political supporters and influential fossil fuel companies, including the coal company Murray Energy and utility FirstEnergy, have pushed for a government-ordered bailout, while a diverse mix of environmental advocates, major grid operators and some public utility companies and natural gas suppliers have argued strongly against it. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The administration wants to keep coal and nuclear generators from being driven out of business by cheaper natural gas or carbon-free wind and solar. A few months ago, FERC rebuffed Perry’s attempt to subsidize plant operators who keep 90 days of fuel on hand. Now, the White House has told Perry to use his own emergency powers under two laws to bail the industry out on grounds that plant closures are presenting a national security emergency. But the idea that the grid is currently so frail as to present an urgent military crisis has received little support, and next to none at the commission. FERC’s chairman, Kevin McIntyre, reading a formal statement aloud, spoke of the deliberative approach the commission has adopted: opening a docket to solicit the views of all parties, especially the grid operators with the fingertip control of electricity supply. To Trump and his allies, this is bureaucratese for kicking the can down the road and risks providing too little assistance too late. Commissioner Neil Chatterjee, a Kentucky native and former energy advisor to pro-coal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), was the most receptive to some kind of action, if not on an emergency basis. “In my view, ‘no action’ is like driving your car without a seat belt,” he said. Other commissioners echoed Chatterjee’s call for “vigilance.” But while they said it was important to keep the grid resilient during storms, heat waves, cold snaps or market upheavals, they looked askance at emergency federal intervention that would favor one fuel or another. That, said Commissioner Robert Powelson, a former member of Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission and past president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, would be “a real step back” from the benefits that have accrued to competing fuel suppliers and to consumers alike. It would also retreat from the climate and other environmental benefits from wind and solar, as well as from storage technologies and smart metering that are helping to clean up the grid. Commissioners Richard Glick, a former official with energy company Iberdrola, and Cheryl LaFleur, a former executive at National Grid USA who was appointed to FERC by President Barack Obama in",

    "title": "Pruitt Starts Rewriting How EPA Weighs Costs, Benefits of Regulation",
    "date": "2018-06-07T20:31:04-04:00",
    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency took its first step on Thursday toward a comprehensive overhaul of the cost-benefit calculations that underpin the entire array of its regulations, notably any actions to rein in global warming. In a notice inviting the public to comment on whether and how to adjust its methods, the agency signaled a potential wave of revisions to how it seeks balance in its rules under laws governing air, water, solid waste, pesticides and climate change. One option it flagged, which could have far-reaching effects on rules involving fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gases, would do away with expansive calculations of benefits when rules meant to control one form of pollution also serendipitously cut back on another. Because burning fossil fuels gives off many kinds of harmful pollution, regulators have commonly cited the full range of ancillary benefits that arise whenever new rules suppress the use of coal, oil and natural gas. At the request of industry, the EPA’s notice said, the agency will consider changing this approach. Even if some proposed rule could bring greenhouse gas emissions down to zero, such as by replacing fossil fuels with clean alternatives, the agency would not count the benefits to public health that would result as choking smog and soot vanished along with the carbon dioxide. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made plain that he wants to challenge the cost-benefit justifications not just for climate-related rules put forward by the Obama administration, but also for many other regulations that polluting industries find onerous. “Many have complained,” Pruitt said, “that the previous administration inflated the benefits and underestimated the costs of its regulations through questionable cost-benefit analysis.” That is a common complaint from the fossil fuel industries, and one that Pruitt himself turned to when, as Oklahoma’s attorney general, he sued the agency he now runs. Among his main targets now are the Clean Power Plan’s limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, controls on oilfield emissions of methane, goals for automotive fuel efficiency and tailpipe emissions, and other rules that the Trump administration has said it wants to freeze, roll back or repeal. The Trump administration has already taken some steps along these lines, the EPA said in announcing the latest move. For example, it has revised the way it calculates what economists call the “social cost of carbon,” an attempt to measure in today’s dollars the costs imposed on future generations every time a ton of carbon dioxide is emitted. Under the Obama administration this estimate was set at about $35 per ton of CO2, a figure that many economists consider much too low to reflect the true harm of global warming. Under the Trump approach it would be about $5. And when EPA proposed its repeal of the Clean Power Plan, it eliminated from the cost-benefit analysis any consideration of the public health benefits that would come from controlling sooty particles from burning coal, even though public health scientists estimate that particulate pollution sickens and kills tens of thousands of people. In its formal notice seeking public comment, the EPA observed that industry groups had requested this kind of change when the agency solicited public views on “a myriad of regulatory reform issues” in early",

    "title": "China’s Dramatic Solar Shift Could Take Sting Out of Trump’s Panel Tariffs",
    "date": "2018-06-08T07:30:21-04:00",
    "content": "The American solar market may be about to get boost from an unexpected source: Energy analysts say the Chinese government’s decision to dramatically cut its solar power subsidies will create a glut of solar panels and send their prices tumbling worldwide. It comes at a crucial time for American solar installers. Falling prices could take the sting out of President Trump’s solar panel tariffs, which have raised costs in the United States and led to billions of dollars in cancelled and frozen U.S. investments. “It’s changing the tone from negative to positive for the U.S.,” said Xiaoting Wang, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Last week, the Chinese government announced it would halt approvals of new subsidized utility-scale solar plants, limit the amount of smaller-scale distributed generation installed and shrink the subsidies it provides to solar generators. All told, these policies are expected to cut the amount of solar capacity installed this year in China by 30 to 40 percent, according to Wood Mackenzie and BNEF. Because China leads the world in new solar installations, the steep drop in demand will ripple across the global market. BNEF expects prices of some panels to fall 34 percent as result. That will bring down installation costs for new solar projects, particularly large, utility-scale systems, and spur new investment in other countries, though BNEF said that new investment is unlikely to make up for the drop in China. Morgan Lyons, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said it’s too soon to know what the effects on the U.S. market will be, but that it will likely lead to lower costs. The drop could also counteract the impact of new tariffs the Trump administration imposed on imported solar panels. The tariffs, which started this year at 30 percent and will decline over the next three years, gave a boost to domestic manufacturers of solar panels, who faced competition from cheap imports from China and other countries. One of those manufacturers, First Solar Inc., saw its stock price fall sharply after China’s announcement because it’s now expected to face lower-cost competition once again. But the tariffs have the opposite effect on the solar installation sector, which employs far more people than manufacturing. U.S. solar developers have canceled or frozen more than $2.5 billion in investments, Reuters reported Thursday. A report by GTM Research said the tariffs would cut solar installations by 11 percent over five years, or about 7.6 gigawatts less new capacity than previously forecast. While the announcement by China sent a shock through the solar industry, it wasn’t entirely surprising, according to BNEF. The costs of the subsidies the government provides to the renewable energy industry have been growing at an unsustainable rate, analysts said. The nation’s solar producers have also had to curtail their actual output because they’ve grown faster than the grid’s capacity. The cut in subsidies will address both of those problems by slowing growth, Frank Yu, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie in Beijing, said in a research note. Wind energy has faced similar issues in China, and officials have discussed cutting subsidies for that industry as well. The new policies may also spur innovation and competition, making the industry more efficient. The Chinese government said it would require utility-scale solar projects to sell their electricity through competitive auctions, a move that will likely lead to lower prices. All of this together, Yu said, will speed the adoption of solar power outside China, particularly in Southeast Asia, which may attract more investment from China and benefit from lower prices. This week, Chinese solar firms sent a letter to their government urging it to delay the new policies, saying they faced huge debts and needed a few more years of subsidies to be more competitive. If the policies remain as announced, the global market will face a period of turmoil first as the effects spread throughout the global supply chain. Eventually, though, Yu said they’ll help solar compete with conventional power sources without the need of government support. Already, some types of utility-scale solar projects are competitive with even the most efficient natural gas power plants. In March, BNEF released a report saying that costs for solar, wind and batteries were falling fast enough that they’re putting pressure on fossil fuels globally. In particular, it said lower battery costs mean that wind and solar facilities can now store power relatively cheaply and release it when needed. “Some existing coal and gas power stations, with sunk capital costs, will continue to have a role for many years,” the report said. “But the economic case for building new coal and gas capacity is crumbling, as batteries start to encroach on the flexibility and peaking revenues enjoyed by fossil fuel plants.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2018-06-01T11:10:00-04:00",
    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency’s Science Advisory Board, in a rebuke to the Trump administration’s retreat on environmental protection, voted overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of a full board review of the agency’s most important actions to dismantle climate policy. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who appointed about 15 members of the 44-member board, now must decide whether to accept its recommendation that the outside scientific experts be allowed to formally vet his decisions. With only two members dissenting, the Science Advisory Board agreed that it had received insufficient information on the science behind several of Pruitt’s decisions—including his planned repeal of the Clean Power Plan and methane regulations on oil and gas operations, the weakening of auto efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards, and the elimination of a rule to curb truck pollution. The board also backed a full review of a revised “social cost of carbon” cost-benefit analysis EPA is using that essentially wipes out the benefits of actions to curb carbon emissions. And the board voted unanimously for a review of Pruitt’s proposal to restrict the types of scientific evidence the agency can use in writing EPA rules, his so-called “secret science” policy. In a series of votes, the board endorsed all of the recommendations of a work group of 10 of its members, who reported that they had received little information from the agency on the science driving Pruitt’s policy changes. “A common theme is we asked EPA for information, and we didn’t get anything,” said Michael Honeycutt, chief toxicologist for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, in his first meeting as chairman of the Science Advisory Board, a position Pruitt appointed him to last fall. Pruitt, who was invited by the board to attend the meeting but did not, released a statement in the wake of the votes. “EPA’s Science Advisory Board provides valuable independent expertise that informs and improves EPA’s actions,” he said. “We look forward to the Board’s feedback and insight that develop from this meeting.” The main purpose of the board is to review the quality and relevance of scientific research used by the EPA to draft regulations. The meeting was the first since Pruitt instituted a new rule barring scientific researchers who receive EPA grants from serving on the board. There is no similar ban for researchers who receive money from industry. Pruitt said it was an effort to “promote fresh perspectives,” but critics said he was creating a more industry-friendly board. One of his new appointees, Washington, D.C., consultant Anne Smith, who has done extensive economic analysis questioning the cost of EPA regulations on behalf of fossil fuel interests, recused herself from the board’s consideration of the Clean Power Plan. More than 20 speakers—public health academics, environmental advocates and one trucking industry official—spoke before the board, all of them advocating a full scientific review of the EPA actions. Dr. Mary Rice, a pulmonary disease specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who spoke on behalf of the American Thoracic Society, raised concerns about Pruitt’s move to rule out agency use of science that is not based on public data. Although Pruitt claims the rule is a move for transparency, Rice and others argued that it would cut out use of some of the most important epidemiological research showing the dangers of air pollution. “This rule gives EPA an excuse to ignore research involving real people,” she said. Glen Kedzie, vice president and environment and energy counsel of the American Trucking Associations, spoke out against Pruitt’s decision to rescind a regulation governing so-called “glider” trucks—trucks that are retrofitted with rebuilt engines that spew out more pollution than conventional trucks. EPA’s decision relied on a glider truck industry-funded study, which recently released EPA emails show the principal author has disavowed. “Fatally flawed studies funded by special interests have no place in the decision-making of an agency charged with protecting human health and the environment,” Kedzie said. Honeycutt, the chair, at one point proposed that the board postpone its decision on whether to review the regulations at issue until more information was forthcoming from the agency. Earlier in the meeting, the board had voted unanimously to defer making a decision on another major Pruitt action—the rewriting of the Waters of the U.S. Rule, which defines which wetlands are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act. One board member, Larry Monroe—the recently retired chief environmental officer of Atlanta-based Southern Company, one of the nation’s largest power companies—said he thought a decision should be deferred. “These are legal and policy issues. I’m not sure what the science is there,” Monroe said. “We can crank the process up quickly if it turns out there’s science that needs to be explored—I’d be surprised if there were.” But other board members noted that because the EPA planned to publish its rules this summer, the delay would leave the Science Advisory Board little time to weigh in while it could still make a difference. In the end, only Monroe and S. Stanley Young, a private consultant based in Raleigh, N.C. voted against a full board review of the regulatory actions. Both were appointed by Pruitt, who began appointing industry-connected members to the EPA’s advisory boards in",

    "content": "The most widely-used technology for detecting methane leaks from oil and gas operations does not work reliably in extremely cold weather—like on Alaska’s North Slope, according to recent research and the industry’s own reports. When the weather hits the extreme lows common around Prudhoe Bay, when the winds whip and the sun dips below the horizon for a few months, the infrared technology required to look for methane leaks isn’t always able to find them. “A lot of the equipment just doesn’t function well at -40 or -50,” said James Plosay, who manages the air permits program for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation’s Division of Air Quality. Across the country, recent reports have found that methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure are under-reported. One recent study by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) found that as much as five times more methane could be leaking from sites in Pennsylvania than industry reports to state regulators. But what’s happening on Alaska’s North Slope represents a unique problem—one of a litany of challenges facing operators in the punishing conditions there—and raises questions about how accurate estimates of fugitive emissions are in a place where the climate change stakes are among the highest. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Methane is a potent climate forcer. Though it’s a short-lived climate pollutant that does not remain in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, methane’s impact on climate is much greater than CO2 in the short-term. In the Arctic, where temperatures are rising at least twice as fast as the rest of the world, methane alone has caused a half a degree Celsius of warming. Since",

    "date": "2018-05-24T16:00:41-04:00",
    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday expanded the opportunity for vocal critics to object to a controversial proposal that would restrict the types of scientific research the agency can draw on when writing regulations. In a concession to scientists, environmentalists and lawmakers, the agency announced it would extend a public comment period on the proposed rule until mid-August and hold a public hearing in July. Some of the nation’s leading scientific groups and hundreds of public health scientists and professionals have warned the rule would harm public health by prohibiting the EPA from using major health studies that promised participants confidentiality. The proposal was published for public comment on April 30. The EPA is required to consider the comments when writing the final regulation. With the comment period extended into August, those scientists will now have an additional two and half months to build a case against the proposal. We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. “EPA is committed to public participation and transparency in the rulemaking process,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in a statement. “By extending the comment period for this rule and holding a public hearing, we are giving stakeholders the opportunity to provide valuable input about how EPA can improve the science underlying its rules.” The policy reflects changes sought for decades by fossil fuel companies and other industries. It is aimed particularly at widely confirmed epidemiological studies that underpin regulations on emissions of smog and soot from burning fossil fuels. The health benefits of reducing those forms of pollution are often cited as co-benefits of controlling emissions of greenhouse gases. Even before the official announcement was made, scientists and public health advocates expressed strong opposition. In a letter to Pruitt, the American Geophysical Union, which represents 60,000 scientists, said that “to exclude vital scientific information from consideration would put our local communities’ health and well-being at risk.” A group of nearly 1,000 scientists, including former EPA employees, wrote a letter urging Pruitt to abandon the proposal, saying it “would negatively impact EPA public protections that reduce levels of lead, harmful chemicals, and fine particle pollution, among others.” Editors and publishers of the leading scientific journals also criticized the proposal. Rush Holt, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the executive publisher of the Science journals, issued a statement in April saying, “this proposal appears to be an attempt to remove valid and relevant scientific evidence from the rule-making process.” Earlier this month, a 10-member working group of EPA’s Scientific Advisory Board—including four members appointed by Pruitt—published a memorandum saying the rule was proposed without the necessary scientific input and calling for the full board to review it at its May 31 meeting. The agency originally offered a 30-day comment period for the rule, and planned to hold no public hearings. Many critics, including hundreds of public health scientists, some environmental groups and 20 senators asked the agency to extend the period, calling 30 days extraordinarily short for such a significant change. The public comment period will now last through August 17. Comments can be submitted at this federal website. The public hearing will be held July 17 at EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C.

    "date": "2018-05-29T21:41:20-04:00",
    "content": "Faster international action to control global warming could halt the spread of dengue fever in the Western Hemisphere and avoid more than 3 million new cases a year in Latin America and the Caribbean by the end of the century, scientists report. The tropical disease, painful but not usually fatal, afflicts hundreds of millions of people around the world. There is no vaccine, so controlling its spread by reining in global warming would be a significant health benefit. The study is one of several recently published that attempt to quantify the benefits of cutting pollution fast enough to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. It also projects infection patterns at 2 degrees of warming and 3.7 degrees, a business-as-usual case. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Scientists have predicted that climate change could create the wetter, hotter conditions that favor diseases spread by various insects and parasites. This study focuses on one widespread disease and on one geographical region. Published May 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study was conducted by researchers from the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom and the Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso in Brazil. It is part of an urgent effort by scientists around the world to collect evidence on the difference between 2 degrees of warming and 1.5 degrees, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is due to report on the latest science this fall. Either target would require bringing net emissions of carbon dioxide to zero within the next several decades, the IPCC has projected, but to stay within 1.5 degrees would require achieving the cuts much more rapidly. Without greater ambition, the study projected an additional 12.1 million annual cases of dengue fever in the Caribbean and Latin America by the end of the century. By comparison, if warming is held to 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times—the longstanding international climate goal—the number of estimated additional cases in the region falls to 9.3 million. Controlling emissions to keep the temperature trajectory at 1.5 degrees Celsius would lower that to an annual increase of 8.8 million new cases. The increase in infection is driven in great part by how a warmer world extends the dengue season when mosquitoes are breeding and biting. The study found that areas where the dengue season would last more than three months would be “considerably” smaller if warming is constrained to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The areas most affected by the increase in dengue would be southern Mexico, the Caribbean, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and the coastal regions of Brazil. In Brazil alone, global warming of no more than 1.5 degrees might prevent 1.4 million dengue cases a year. The study found that under the 3.7 degree scenario, considered “business as usual,” dengue fever could spread to regions that have historically seen few cases. Keeping to 1.5 degrees could limit such a geographical expansion. People living in previously untouched areas would have less built-up immunity and would be more likely to get sick, while public health providers in some such places “are woefully unprepared for dealing with major dengue epidemics,” the authors warned.

    "date": "2018-05-23T12:00:13-04:00",
    "content": "This article was updated and corrected on May 24 to reflect the scope of the advisory group’s memoranda, which also call for reviews of regulatory rollbacks on carbon dioxide from power plants and methane from oil and gas operations. Scott Pruitt, the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency, faces a broadening challenge to his efforts to roll back greenhouse gas regulations, as agency science advisers expand the list of policies they want to vet at an upcoming meeting. A work group of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, in a May 18 memo, has added three more of his actions to a list they want reviewed by the full board: the weakening of auto efficiency and emissions standards, Pruitt’s elimination of a rule to curb truck pollution, and the cost-benefit analysis underpinning the Clean Power Plan, which the Trump administration is trying to undo. In an April 30 memo, the work group called for the full board to review Pruitt’s repealing of the Clean Power Plan The main purpose of the board is to review the quality and relevance of scientific research used by the EPA to draft regulations. The group’s actions signal that the full board’s May 31-June 1 meeting will be partly devoted to the scientific community’s harshest critiques of President Donald Trump‘s deregulatory agenda. The same 10-member work group, which includes four of Pruitt’s own appointees, already had called for a full board review of his effort to restrict the agency’s use of scientific studies. In the new memo, the agency science advisers—all outside academics and consultants with expertise in the science and technology related to the proposed EPA actions—picked apart the Pruitt proposals. In every case, they noted that the assertions Pruitt’s EPA made to support its regulatory rollbacks lacked peer review or independent evaluation. They also noted the agency’s failure to take into account the impact of its actions on future greenhouse gas emissions, public health and safety due to climate change, or the indirect impact due to an increase of other pollutants. “These would seem to be logical and necessary areas for scientific and technical assessment,” the work group said. “Such information must be transparent, accessible to the public, and appropriately peer-reviewed.” As for one of the more arcane actions they challenged—a recalibration of what economists call the “social cost of carbon,” a calculation of the future damages of climate change expressed in today’s dollars—they warned that he was writing off the costs that global warming would inflict on “future generations which will be most impacted.” The work group pointed to holes in Pruitt’s evidence for his “final determination” that President Obama’s vehicle fuel efficiency plan for the",

    "content": "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt faces harsh criticism from members of the agency’s Science Advisory Board (SAB)—including from some he named to the panel himself—over his plan to restrict the types of scientific evidence the agency can use in writing EPA rules. Ten members of an SAB work group, in a signed memorandum, called for the full board to scrutinize Pruitt’s proposal at a meeting on May 31, saying his approach was designed without necessary input from the scientific community. Leading national science organizations have mounted a campaign to reject Pruitt’s approach. Pruitt’s proposal would no longer allow the EPA to use scientific studies where the underlying data is not public. The move could rule out health studies that promised participants confidentiality—some of which have served as the underpinning of regulations, especially clean air standards. The policy takes up a cause long-championed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies in Congress. “The era of secret science has come to an end,” Pruitt said in announcing the proposal on April 24. The SAB advisers, all outside experts in a range of environmental sciences, said curbing EPA’s use of epidemiological health studies could skew regulatory outcomes with long-term consequences. “The development of guidelines and rules in this arena requires careful collaboration between the government and the scientific community,” the science advisers said in the memo, first reported by InsideEPA. Although the advisers applauded the purported goal of transparency, they said “the precise design of the rule appears to have been developed without a public process for soliciting input from the scientific community.” We're hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.See jobs Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. According to the advisers, Pruitt’s proposal did not take into consideration previous steps that the EPA had taken to enhance transparency, nor efforts by the scientific community to ensure greater public access to data. The group said the proposal also “oversimplifies” the effort that would be involved in redacting scientific data to meet the new EPA requirements. “Without access to the restricted data, regulatory programs could become more or less stringent than they otherwise would be, with consequences for both regulatory costs and benefits,” the memo said. It noted that a similar proposal had stalled in Congress for several years. “The rule could have the effect of removing legal, ethical, and peer-reviewed studies of health effects as sources to support the agency’s regulatory efforts,” it added. Four of the 10 SAB work group members who criticized the proposal are new members of the Science Advisory Board, appointed by Pruitt. They are the SAB’s new chairman, Michael Honeycutt, who is Texas’s chief state toxicologist; John D. Graham, dean of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, who was a senior regulatory official in President George W. Bush’s White House; Arkansas environmental official Bob Blanz; and Robert W. Merritt, a retired oil industry geologist and independent consultant from Houston. They are among the 66 new experts Pruitt has placed on three different EPA scientific committees. Many of them are critics of the agency and come from industry or state government. The six other members of the group, including its chair, Allison Cullen, a professor at the University of Washington, were members of the SAB before the Trump administration took over. EPA’s SAB has a long-standing process of assigning work groups to review the adequacy of the science supporting regulatory actions, and to report to the larger board. John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has called Pruitt’s proposal an effort “to censor science,” said the work group’s harsh review was significant. “It’s encouraging that EPA’s scientific advisors are standing up for independent, peer-reviewed research, and leveling strong criticisms at Pruitt’s harmful proposal,” he said. “Let’s hope this important critique from EPA’s scientific advisors will convince Pruitt to abandon this insidious idea.” It is unclear how the full SAB will review the agency’s science proposal, or whether its input will come soon enough to influence Pruitt’s plan. The 30-day public comment period on the proposal is set to close on May 30, a day before the SAB meeting. EPA’s press office did not reply to queries on whether the agency was considering extending the comment period, or whether the memo would be part of the agency’s consideration on the rulemaking.

    "date": "2018-04-23T22:45:41-04:00",
    "content": "A federal appeals court in New York on Monday blocked the Trump administration’s efforts to delay penalties against automakers that fail to meet carbon-cutting emissions standards in new cars. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit threw out a decision, announced by the Department of Transportation last July, to postpone increases in the penalties that automakers are required to pay if they don’t meet efficiency standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations. The Trump administration’s attempt to delay the penalties was its first salvo in a crusade to weaken the vehicle standards, which were predicted to prevent billions of tons of climate-warming carbon emissions from newer vehicles. “The Trump administration’s first step in its efforts to weaken vehicle efficiency standards has now failed,” said Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity and a professor at New York University’s School of Law. “Today’s result is likely a predictor of analytical and legal weaknesses in the administration’s broader effort to water down vehicle-efficiency rules.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. In the final days of the Obama administration, the department increased the penalty by nearly 150 percent for exceeding the emissions standards—a hefty, inflation-matching bump intended to prod automakers to meet the standards for newer model years. As the increased penalties were set to kick in, the Trump administration announced in July it was delaying the effective date. It said then that companies had paid more than $890 million in CAFE penalties. Five states—New York, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Vermont—and environmental groups sued, saying the administration had failed to provide adequate public notice, as required by law, and violated another federal law requiring civil penalties to rise with inflation. The judges on Monday did not issue an opinion with their ruling, so it wasn’t immediately clear how they reached their decision. [Update: The opinion was issued on June 29. In it, the court explained that the administration had violated the Administrative Procedures Act by delaying the penalties without issuing a public notice or allowing a comment period. “Notice and comment are not mere formalities,” the court wrote. “They are basic to our system of administrative law.”] “The court acted very quickly,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign and a longtime advocate of fuel-efficiency standards. “I think that conveys that this wasn’t even a close case.” The decision comes as the administration attempts to further weaken the CAFE standards. Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a “final determination” that it would revise the standards, saying the Obama administration’s decision “didn’t comport with reality.” Though it’s unclear what any new standards might look like, the move puts the administration at odds with several states, notably California. Under a special waiver, California is allowed to maintain more stringent standards than those required by the federal government. The state—and others that typically follow its lead—has said it intends to maintain the existing standards. Without effective standards, analysts say, the auto industry will likely backslide into making less efficient cars, with serious consequences for climate change. The EPA projected that the original standards would prevent more than 6 billion metric tons of greenhouses gas emissions over the lifetime of cars sold in model years",

    "date": "2018-04-24T17:19:28-04:00",
    "content": "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a new regulation on Tuesday to restrict the types of scientific evidence that can be used in writing EPA rules. Scientists and health organizations say the move could rule out the use of major health studies that support clean air and water regulations and that promised the participants confidentiality. Scott Pruitt’s proposal would only allow the EPA to use studies where the underlying data is made public. Internal documents show how the rule is the culmination of a years-long effort led by Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, and other industry-aligned politicians and political appointees. Critics of the policy change say any claims that it’s being done in the name of transparency are red herrings. “In reality, these are phony issues that weaponize ‘transparency’ to facilitate political interference in science-based decision making, rather than genuinely address either,” a group of nearly 1,000 scientists wrote in a letter to Pruitt on Monday. “The result will be policies and practices that will ignore significant risks to the health of every American.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The proposal will be published for public comment, which the EPA is to take into account in writing the final regulation. Once finalized, the rule may be subject to legal challenge, meaning the courts likely will have an opportunity to weigh in on Pruitt’s plan. The Natural Resources Defense Council responded that “NRDC will do all we can to stop this arbitrary proposal from ever being adopted.” The EPA has long relied on well-established population and disease surveys that aggregate data on large populations where patient identifications are kept confidential. The epidemiological studies have allowed regulators to understand how pollutants in the air and water impact humans and provide a scientific justification for regulations involving air and water pollution. Pruitt’s new rule would strike at the core of those regulations. The studies have stood up to peer review, and researchers are typically granted access to redacted data or sign agreements to maintain confidentiality. “Suggesting that the EPA has not been transparent is a fallacy,” said Inês Azevedo, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. “When compared to other national environmental agencies, the amount of information EPA currently makes available to the public and for researchers is dramatically better and more detailed.” Pruitt made the announcement with Smith and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) standing by his side. “The era of secret science at EPA is coming to an end,” Pruitt said. These studies, which promise participants confidentiality, would be blocked by the new rule—a major boon to the fossil fuel industry, which has opposed prominent U.S. health studies that show fine soot pollution, largely from the burning of fossil fuels, shortened lives. “This is a policy that will most likely be giving special treatment to industry and exclude critical public health data,” said Yogin Kothari, a senior Washington representative with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It will prevent the EPA from using the entire suite of the best available data out there when it makes decisions using science.” The proposed regulation mirrors legislation long-championed by Smith. His bill, originally called the Secret Science Reform Act, passed the House of Representatives three times but has never been taken up by the Senate. After the repeat failure of the bill, which is now called the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, Smith’s office—along with political appointees within the EPA—sought to have the EPA implement it through an internal policy change. Smith first approached Pruitt’s office with the plan on Jan. 9,",

The warmer water is eating away at the glaciers’ icy grasp on the seafloor. As a result, the grounding line—where the ice last touches bedrock—has been receding by as much as 600 feet per year, a new study shows. Behind the grounding line, the land-based ice then speeds up, increasing the rate of sea level rise. The new continent-wide measurements of grounding lines suggests a widespread pattern of melting all around Antarctica, said University of Leeds climate researcher Hannes Konrad, lead author of the analysis published today in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. “We’re seeing this all across the ice sheet,” he said. “As the grounding line of the ice shelves moves back, the inland glaciers accelerate and raise global sea level.” Konrad and colleagues from University College London and the Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany measured how the grounding lines are shifting across 16,000 kilometers of coastline using data from the European Space Agency’s CryoSat-2 satellites. Their animation above illustrates how the grounding line, tracked by satellite, is changing. Gravity pulls Antarctica’s three-mile thick ice sheet into the ocean along ocean-bottom canyons. The grounding line is where the ice begins to float, and the glaciers and ice sheets turn into ice shelves. When they loosen from the ocean floor, the flow of ice from land accelerates. Ice leaving firm ground and then melting in the oceans causes seas to rise around the world. From",

    "content": "Health advocates fear that a massive federal review of the risks posed by soot and other air pollution could be undermined by a new Environmental Protection Agency policy that would block the use of non-public scientific data, such as health studies that promised patients confidentiality. In an exclusive interview he gave to the conservative Daily Caller website this week, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced his new policy and said some studies would be ruled out because the researchers have not made the raw data public. That change would eliminate the use of some of the main studies supporting regulations for particulate pollution, granting a boon to the fossil fuel industry and its allies, who have sought such a change for more than 20 years. It also could rule out use of science that draws on confidential business information or intellectual property that the agency is legally prohibited from disclosing. Under the Clean Air Act, limits on particulate matter and other main forms of pollution must be set low enough to protect the public’s health and updated periodically to reflect the best available science. For decades, this has meant relying on well-established population and disease surveys aggregating data on large but anonymous populations. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Pruitt is seeking to end this practice. “We need to make sure their data and methodology are published as part of the record,” Pruitt said. “Otherwise, it’s not transparent. It’s not objectively measured, and that’s important.” Environmental and health advocates say Pruitt’s so-called “secret science” argument is a red herring. The studies that have long been used have stood up to peer review, and researchers typically can gain access to data in redacted form or by agreeing to maintain its confidentiality. The real aim, advocates for public health say, is to narrow the scope of science used in regulation. Pruitt’s policy mirrors legislation sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science Committee, that has been passed by the House of Representatives three times but has never been taken up by the Senate. The science controversy sprung from large, long-term studies by both Harvard University and the American Cancer Society in the early",

    "title": "$1.3 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill Passes After GOP Drops Anti-Environment Riders",

    "content": "Sign up to receive our latest reporting on climate change, energy and environmental justice, sent directly to your inbox. Subscribe here. Updated March 23 with President Trump signing the bill. Congress passed a $1.3 trillion federal spending bill early Friday following negotiations in which Republicans, in order to garner needed Democratic support, agreed to remove a slew of provisions that would have gutted environmental and campaign finance laws. The congressional negotiators also agreed not to impose the draconian spending cuts President Donald Trump wanted in a variety of clean energy and environmental enforcement programs, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In fact, the latter saw an increase. Because the so-called “omnibus” spending package includes partial funding for a wall on the Mexican border and a steep increase in Pentagon spending, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was able to declare it a compromise that fulfilled Trump’s agenda. With a deadline looming to avoid a government shutdown, Trump signed the bill on Friday, a few hours after he suggested on Twitter that he might decide to veto it. Environmental, health and public interest advocates said the deal demonstrated the power of public outrage over dozens of riders the GOP sought to attach to the must-pass bill to fund the government through the remainder of this fiscal year. “What is crystal clear is that the outrage from the public is breaking through to Congress,” said the Sierra Club’s legislative director, Melinda Pierce. “While the omnibus is far from perfect, it is unmistakable that the public’s clear message made all the difference.” More than 80 anti-environmental-policy riders had been included in either the original House-passed version of the appropriations bill or in the Senate drafts as Congressional leaders entered into closed-door negotiations. Just as troubling to climate advocates and other public interest groups were provisions they feared would increase the flow of dark money into campaigns and elections. But Democrats, while in the minority, had bargaining power. GOP leaders feared they would lose the votes of Republican Freedom Caucus members and deficit hawks like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who might balk at the prospect of passing a bill more than 2,200 pages long only hours after it was unveiled. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The omnibus package—which the House passed on Thursday and the Senate approved early Friday—keeps funding for the EPA at the current $8.1 billion, a rejection of the 31 percent funding cut that Trump had sought. Funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which the White House proposed to cut by 70 percent, will actually see an increase of 12.5 percent to $2.32 billion. Most of the anti-environmental-policy riders, like those that would have blocked implementation of the Interior Department’s methane venting and flaring rule and endangered species protections, were eliminated. Also jettisoned was a proposal to open the door to campaign spending by churches—a change in long-standing federal election law that public interest advocates feared would be expanded to other non-profit foundations, paving the way for a new flow of tax-deductible dark money donations to candidates. But a few provisions to benefit special interests and to fend off campaign finance regulation survived in the final bill. The legislation does contain a rider that the wood products industry has long sought to encourage the burning of biomass for electricity; advocates for renewable energy have feared such a change could disadvantage solar and wind energy. The final bill also includes a provision barring the EPA from enforcing protections against particulate matter, lead, carbon monoxide and mercury from certain incinerators. “These riders are especially concerning because children and people with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are among the most vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution emitted from incinerators and biomass burning,” Harold Wimmer, president of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. The spending bill also would prevent, for the time being, further federal regulation of campaign finance rules. The final omnibus included provisions barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring public companies to disclose their political spending, and stopping the Internal Revenue Service from further defining nonprofit political activity. Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at the watchdog group Public Citizen and co-chair of the Clean Budget Coalition, a coalition of 260 groups that were lobbying against the riders, said she was disappointed that Congress aimed to block what she saw as “critically important” campaign finance disclosure rules. But she praised the package overall, including the decision to allot $307 million more than the Trump administration requested to combat midterm election cyber-meddling, and an additional $380 million for election security grants. She said the fight over better campaign finance disclosure would be put off for another day. “Toxic riders that hurt our campaign finance system, our environmental safeguards and our financial regulations are inappropriate for an appropriations package,” she said, “and we hope to build on today’s momentum and remove the remaining campaign finance poison pills in the next package.” That may take some time. Although the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, many political observers believe that the current omnibus appropriations bill will be the last major legislation that Congress considers before the midterm elections this fall. Congressional leaders negotiating the package faced two competing pressures: include wish-list items that likely would not have another chance for a vote this year, or avoid a government shutdown in a tension-fraught election year. They dropped the riders and went for the deal. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

    "date": "2018-03-15T20:08:25-04:00",
    "content": "Two environmental groups filed suit Thursday to force the Environmental Protection Agency to disclose its correspondence with the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that has led a years-long campaign to discredit climate science. The complaint by the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) suggests that contact between the EPA and Heartland has been far more extensive than previously known. An EPA Freedom of Information Act official told EDF last year that an agency search had yielded “between 200 to 600 records” of such correspondence, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Virginia. “EPA’s efforts to promote climate change deniers and undermine peer-reviewed science behind closed doors is not only a failure of its mission, it is illegal,” said Kym Hunter, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “The public has a clear and protected right to know what the EPA is doing and with whom they are communicating, including those pushing a climate-denier agenda.” Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case. The environmental groups filed their Freedom of Information Act requests for communications between EPA and the Heartland Institute last year. Under  law, the agency is required to “promptly” provide information that is subject to public disclosure, and is to make a determination within 20 working days of receiving a request. The groups said that after initially acknowledging the requests, EPA has stopped communicating with the Southern Environmental Law Center and has only offered vague responses to EDF. At issue in the  dispute is EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt‘s repeated push for what he refers to as a “red team, blue team” review of climate science in which rival “teams” would debate the scientific consensus on climate change. The idea is opposed by most climate scientists as seeking to create the appearance of a debate where there is none in mainstream science. But Heartland Institute spokesperson Jim Lakely was quoted last July as saying that the EPA had reached out to the think tank for help in identifying team members, and that Heartland was “happy to oblige.” News reports say that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly opposed Pruitt’s plan as politically risky and that his deputy, Rick Dearborn, told the EPA administrator in December that the idea was “dead” and not to be discussed further. But Pruitt has insisted as recently as this week that the idea remains under consideration. Heartland hosts an annual conference of scientists skeptical of humanity’s role in global warming and publishes reports seeking to rebut the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

    "title": "Adding Batteries to Existing Rooftop Solar Could Qualify for 30 Percent Tax Credit",
    "date": "2018-03-05T20:45:32-05:00",
    "content": "Stay informed about the latest climate, energy and environmental justice news by email. Sign up for the ICN newsletter. Homeowners with rooftop solar tied into the grid like the way they can roll back their meters by selling surplus electricity back to the power company. But there’s a drawback: when the grid goes down in a storm, their lights go off too, unless they paid to install a bank of batteries. Now, with battery prices getting cheaper, some homeowners are thinking about beefing up their solar arrays with battery storage and possibly cutting ties with the grid altogether. The taxman just gave them another incentive to do so, making clear that the improvement qualifies for another fat tax credit just like the one they earned when they put up their panels in the first place. The Internal Revenue Service released a private letter ruling on Friday stating that a customer with an existing home solar array is eligible for a 30 percent federal tax credit when they buy and install a battery system, provided it stores only solar energy from their own roof. The private letter ruling was issued to a single taxpayer; it applies only to that specific case, and the IRS says it doesn’t set a precedent. Even so, it tells accountants everywhere how the agency is interpreting the tax law. It suggests that taxpayers can now rest easy taking the tax credit when adding batteries to an existing solar setup, even if they claimed the tax credit when they set up their grid-tied panels, as long as the battery receives power only from the home’s solar panels and none from the grid. It’s a fairly simple matter to comply with the proviso by installing controls that don’t allow power from the grid to go to the battery. It would charge only when the solar panels are generating power. The ruling “marks a milestone” for the residential storage-plus-solar industry, said Kelly Speakes-Backman, CEO of Energy Storage Association. “The 30 percent credit is like jumping ahead five years on the cost curve for home battery systems—so on that count, customers will be able to afford longer-duration systems sooner and present greater opportunity for self-reliance,” she said. Most rooftop solar customers in the U.S. are still tied to the grid, and many have no backup batteries attached. Tesla’s Powerwall is changing the landscape, but it’s still upward of $7,000 on top of the cost of a solar array. The tax credit would put a dent in the cost. The Energy Storage Association is lobbying Congress to pass legislation that better clarifies the eligibility of energy storage for the tax credit and allow storage to pair with other energy sources, such as wind, in addition to solar. But this ruling is a step in the right direction, energy storage experts say. “While most batteries being offered to homeowners today are not large enough to enable full disconnection from the grid when paired with solar, they are certainly critical to helping folks manage their electric bills and ensure uninterrupted service after storms and other common sources of outages,” Speakes-Backman said. “Whether or not you are on the grid, the battery paired with solar definitely puts more power into your own hands.” The solar Investment Tax Credit for homes remains at 30 percent though",

Rising seas will drown most wetlands on the U.S. West Coast in less than a century, a new study led by the U.S. Geological Survey warns. In many areas, the wetlands won’t be able to migrate inland without help. As these coastal marshes vanish, communities will lose valuable wildlife habitat, protection against storm surges and natural carbon storage that helps slow global warming. “Wetlands provide flood protection and sequester carbon. They filter water and improve water quality, they exchange nutrients with the ocean,” said Karen Thorne, a U.S. Geological Survey sea level rise researcher who led the research, published this week in the journal Science Advances. Keeping them healthy is critical for those reasons and for coastal wildlife, since they serve as a nursery and feeding area for fish and marine animals, she said. In many areas, however, the endangered ecosystems won’t be able to ride the rising tides inland because of natural barriers and man-made obstacles like sea walls that stand in the way. Helping them to survive will require political and public support for reallocating land to let wetlands shift and expand, and even abandoning some developed areas, the study’s authors write. Sea level rise is accelerating as rising global temperatures cause the oceans to expand and glaciers and polar ice sheets to melt.

    "content": "Updated with a Feb. 22 federal court ruling against Trump administration efforts to delay the current methane rule. The Trump administration has taken its first step on a slow path to loosen curbs on methane emissions from oil and gas operations on public land, after legal roadblocks stymied its efforts to quickly set aside Obama-era rules on the potent greenhouse gas. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s Bureau of Land Management published a proposal on Feb. 12 that in essence would restore the status quo from before the Obama rules took effect. Zinke is seeking to wipe out the requirements that operators monitor and detect leaks of methane, the main component of natural gas, and capture and sell the fuel instead of flaring it off or venting it to the atmosphere. The Obama administration had portrayed the methane rules as win-win-win: reduce greenhouse gases with basic technology like better valves; capture fuel that the industry can sell; and recover royalties that are lost to the taxpayer along with the gas. But amid low natural gas prices, the industry saw compliance costs that outweighed the money they could make selling captured gas. Oil and gas producers have waged an all-out political and legal campaign to lift the requirements—with little success. The Trump administration now has proposed an entirely new rule and opened a public notice and comment period to build the case for allowing leaky oil and gas operations on federal lands. “In order to achieve energy dominance through responsible energy production, we need smart regulations not punitive regulations,” said Joe Balash, assistant secretary for land and minerals management. “We believe this proposed rule strikes that balance and will allow job growth in rural America.” Matt Watson, associate vice president for climate energy at Environmental Defense Fund, said the Trump administration’s proposal would roll back every emissions reduction provision of the Obama rule.

    "date": "2018-02-06T22:13:11-05:00",
    "content": "Stay informed about the latest climate, energy and environmental justice news. Sign up for the ICN newsletter. Rising temperatures are waking a sleeping giant in the North—the permafrost—and scientists have identified a new danger that comes with that: massive stores of mercury, a powerful neurotoxin, that have been locked in the frozen ground for tens of thousands of years. The Arctic’s frozen permafrost holds some 15 million gallons of mercury. The region has nearly twice as much mercury as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined, according to a new study published Monday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. That’s significantly more than previously known, and it carries risks for humans and wildlife. “It really blew us away,” said Paul Schuster, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado, and lead author of the study. Mercury (which is both a naturally occurring element and is produced by the burning of fossil fuels) is trapped in the permafrost, a frozen layer of earth that contains thousands of years worth of organic carbon, like plants and animal carcasses. As temperatures climb and that ground thaws, what has been frozen within it begins to decompose, releasing gases like methane and carbon dioxide, as well as other long dormant things like anthrax, ancient bacteria and viruses—and mercury. “The mercury that ends up being released as a result of the thaw will make its way up into the atmosphere or through the fluvial systems via rivers and streams and wetlands and lakes and even groundwater,” said Schuster. “Sooner or later, all the water on land ends up in the ocean.” Though the study focused on the magnitude of mercury in the North, Schuster said that’s just half the story. “The other half is: ‘How does it get into the food web?’” he said. Mercury is a bioaccumulator, meaning that, up the food chain, species absorb higher and higher concentrations. That could be particularly dangerous for native people in the Arctic who hunt and fish for their food. Exposure to even small amounts of mercury can cause serious health effects and poses particular risks to human development. “Food sources are important to the spiritual and cultural health of the natives, so this study has major health and economic implications for this region of the world,” said Edda Mutter, science director for the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council. The mercury risk won’t be isolated in the Arctic either. Once in the ocean, Schuster said, it’s possible that fisheries around the world could eventually see spikes in mercury content. He plans to seek to a better understand of this and other impacts from the mercury in subsequent studies. The permafrost in parts of the Arctic is already starting to thaw. The Arctic Council reported last year that the permafrost temperature had risen by .5 degrees Celsius in just the last decade. If emissions continue at their current rate, two-thirds of the Northern Hemisphere’s near-surface permafrost could thaw by",

    "date": "2018-02-05T07:30:44-05:00",
    "content": "Even for the adamantly apolitical American Meteorological Society, President Donald Trump’s fumbling disputations of climate change in a recent television interview were too much. So, on its collegiate, old-school letterhead, the society’s executive director, Keith Seitter, wrote the president a polite but pointed message last week. “There is a wealth of comprehensive and accurate information on climate change available to you and your staff within government agencies, as well as from experts in academic institutions and other organizations,” Seitter nudged, adding that the society “stands ready” to provide expertise to Trump and his cabinet. The suggestion was born out of an exasperation that many scientists, those focused on climate change and otherwise, are feeling in the Trump era. Rather than wring their hands, though, scientists are attempting to do something they’re not especially known for: connect with the public. “Certainly, many scientists have been frustrated by misstatements by the president and members of his administration,” Seitter said. “Many of these scientists are AMS members, so yes, this has been an issue of concern within our membership.” [Update: A response from Trump arrived in April, thanking the group for its commitment but saying his administration “is committed to protecting American workers and American companies from necessary regulatory burdens.”] Responding to the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental laws, its efforts to push qualified scientists off advisory boards and its nominations of climate change deniers to top positions, scientists and their supporters have protested and petitioned. They’re also aware that scientific studies are often written in technical, jargon-laden ways that can be difficult for non-scientists to understand. So, they’re redoubling their efforts to address the stubborn and longstanding challenge of communicating science—and at a time when the message is existentially crucial. Last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a handbook to help its members better communicate the findings of a new IPCC report, due out later this year. The handbook, based on the science of science communication, lays out six principles that scientists can use to explain the complexities of climate science. These tips include “connect with what matters to your audience” and “tell a human story.” In a forward, Roz Pidcock, the IPCC’s head of communications, writes that the handbook maintains a “focus on practical guidance for real public engagement scenarios” and notes that this is the first time the IPCC has produced a document of its kind. Adam Corner, research director at Climate Outreach, the UK-based group commissioned to write the handbook, said being able to help people understand what the evidence shows is even more critical now. “In the U.S., the landscape for communicating climate change has undoubtedly got more hostile since Trump began removing the capacity and resources from environmental science initiatives,” Corner explained. “So, there’s a renewed sense of urgency to ensure climate scientists are supported in the work they do, and to feel confident in engaging effectively with the public.” Corner said the handbook “came from positive developments within and around the IPCC, who have finally begun taking communication more seriously and are investing in their own staff as well as outside expertise to become better equipped to connect beyond specialists’ circles.” The U.S. government has gone in the opposite direction. The Trump administration, which has been erasing climate change information from government websites and deserting science advisory boards across the government, disbanded an advisory panel whose role was to help policymakers and private-sector officials understand and incorporate the findings of the National Climate Assessment into their future planning. That didn’t kill the effort, though. Rather than let the National Climate Assessment findings languish, Columbia University’s Earth Institute announced in January that it had hired the panel’s chair, Richard Moss, to reassemble the panel and resume the work. “There’s been an upwelling of support for the committee, because states and cities and businesses want access to information that helps them prepare,” Moss said in a blog post. “They want a better network, and they want to keep learning from each other.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "Stay informed about the latest climate, energy and environmental justice news by email. Sign up for the ICN newsletter. President Donald Trump‘s decision to slap temporary tariffs on imported solar panels opens up a difficult passage for the industry, but there are good reasons to believe most United States solar ventures will emerge intact—if not entirely unscathed. Most industry analysts agree that the 30 percent tariff on foreign-produced cells and modules, phased out over four years, will not be as devastating a blow as Trump could have dealt. The damage will be done mostly to big utility-scale projects within the booming U.S. solar energy installation business, which opposed the trade barriers because they will raise the costs of imported photovoltaic panels. The tariffs announced Monday will constrain any push into new markets, but will not send the industry into a tailspin. Any crimp in solar’s growth could, however, forestall the kind of rapid clean energy transition that climate science says is urgently needed. “The climate crisis is here, ripping apart communities and threatening wildlife with devastating storms, wildfires and floods,” said Howard Crystal, senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “With Americans in Puerto Rico and Houston still struggling to recover from climate disasters, Trump should be supporting renewable energy rather than making it more costly.” Most of the reaction to the move centered not on its implications for climate change, but on its impact on jobs. The Solar Energy Industries Association, the industry’s main trade group, projects that Trump’s tariff decision will result in the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year, including many in manufacturing.

    "title": "New Jersey to Rejoin East Coast Carbon Market, Virginia May Be Next",
    "date": "2018-01-29T19:59:23-05:00",
    "content": "Updated Jan. 29 with New Jersey governor’s executive order to rejoin RGGI. With federal policies to control greenhouse gas emissions in limbo, more states are taking steps toward putting a price on carbon pollution. In New Jersey, newly elected Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed an executive order Monday directing the state’s environment agency and public utilities board to begin the process of rejoining the East Coast’s carbon cap-and-trade system—the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI. Murphy’s predecessor, Chris Christie, had pulled the state out of RGGI as he positioned himself to run for the Republican presidential nomination. Murphy had promised to bring New Jersey back in. “Five years ago, New Jersey faced Superstorm Sandy. That storm and the devastation it brought to our state was an all-too-real look at our new normal if we do not take climate change seriously,” Murphy said in announcing the order on Monday. “Climate change is real, and a real threat to our state. Doing nothing is not an option.” Virginia, another swing state where Democrats have strengthened their hand, is also looking to join RGGI. If that happens, the addition would increase the size of the carbon market by more than 40 percent due to the large number of coal-fired power plants in the state. But legislative action there on carbon emissions hit a stumbling block in a committee vote this week, indicating that political support there is shakier. The shift in New Jersey is a striking example of the consequences of recent elections in the year since President Donald Trump took office, and it highlights increasing state-level leadership on climate change. “States are not sitting on their hands waiting for the federal government to address the biggest challenges that we face as a country,” said Dale Bryk, chief planning and integration officer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. RGGI has proven popular in most of the states that participate, steering them toward lower carbon dioxide emissions while generating revenues. Murphy said pulling out of RGGI had “cost New Jerseyans millions of dollars that could have been used to increase energy efficiency and improve air quality in our communities.” Prior to New Jersey’s exit, the state received roughly $50 million a year in cap-and-trade revenue to spend on clean energy and energy efficiency measures, a figure that would likely be higher now if the state re-enters the program. The New Jersey legislature has tried three times in recent years to rejoin RGGI, only to watch Christie veto the measures. A state Senate committee passed legislation last week that would make it harder for future governors to pull out of the cap-and-trade system. In Virginia, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe directed state regulators to create a market-based program to reduce carbon emissions through an executive order issued in May. Under the order, revenue generated by the carbon market would go to utility companies rather than the state, though state regulators will have some control over how the companies use the money. State officials are now working out details of the carbon market with RGGI. State legislators are also pursuing a legislative approach for Virginia to join RGGI that would be harder to rescind than an executive order and would give the state greater revenue control than administrative rulemaking under the executive order. One such measure hit a roadblock on Thursday, however, when the bill failed to pass the state senate’s Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources Committee. “The legislative process this year is a bit more of a question mark, but either way Virginia is well along the path to a robust cap-and-trade program,” said Walton Shepherd, a staff attorney with Natural Resources Defense Council. Other states and provinces are also increasing their emissions-reduction efforts: “Across the board you have states stepping up and taking action where the Trump administration is failing,” Mark Kresowik, a regional deputy director for the Sierra Club, said. The state-led policies show there is continued movement on climate change despite the demise of the Clean Power Plan, the cornerstone climate policy of the Obama administration that is now under attack by the Trump administration. “We do need a federal government ultimately that is committed to protecting our climate and environment down the road, but in the meantime, states can stay on track, and they are,” Kresowik said.

    "date": "2018-01-08T21:33:55-05:00",
    "content": "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Monday unanimously rejected a Trump administration gambit that would have favored the coal industry by rewarding electric companies for keeping big stockpiles of fuel on hand, supposedly to improve the reliability of power supplies. The commission, in one of its first significant actions since its membership was fleshed out with President Donald Trump‘s new appointees, said that it would do its own analysis of how the grid is coping and that it had solicited ideas from the nation’s grid operators about how to proceed. The grid operators are the regional authorities who control power supplies, rather than the electric companies or their fuel suppliers. The idea to bolster the coal and nuclear segments of the complex grid was pushed hard by Energy Secretary Rick Perry last year after extensive lobbying by influential fossil fuel companies, including Murray Coal and First Energy. The plan had been excoriated by diverse interest groups, including many environmental advocates, some public utility companies and natural gas suppliers. Consumers would have paid billions in higher bills, and most of the benefits would have gone to a few big companies, studies showed. Neil Chatterjee, a Trump appointee who was the commission’s interim chairman until early December, praised what he called “Secretary Perry’s bold leadership in jump-starting a national conversation on this urgent challenge.” But another new commissioner, Richard Glick, called the proposal, which also would have affected some nuclear plants, “a multi-billion-dollar bailout” that was not supported by the evidence. He was named to FERC by Trump to a Democratic seat on the politically apportioned commission. The FERC ruling was closely watched even though the action Perry proposed seemed legally frail, relying on emergency powers that are rarely invoked. This time, they were being pushed without any sign of an actual emergency, such as a foreign embargo or a crippling strike, that might have undermined the grid. As Harvard expert Ari Pesko outlined in this Twitter thread, the proposal didn’t even meet the threshold legal test that FERC had to consider: whether existing rate schedules, known as tariffs, were inherently unjust or unreasonable, and that the new approach would be fairer. Perry’s theory was that the rates that coal and nuclear utilities were allowed to charge did not reflect all the services they provide to grid stability, and that this was letting renewable energy sources unfairly elbow their way into the marketplace, along with natural gas. The countervailing view is that a pro-coal thumb on the scales was an anachronism in an energy system that would be better served by market forces. Unspoken in this debate—and not on Perry’s radar—has been the imperative of making changes to the electric system to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas that is warming the planet. “Energy regulators must follow the law and act on the best available science, and not pick winners and losers based on political alliances,” said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In all this, FERC has hardly been a household name, even though its decisions over gas pipelines, electric rates and the like affect consumers all over the country. Its role has been increasingly controversial as advocates of a clean energy revolution have lambasted it for pro-industry leanings, even showing up to protest disruptively at FERC hearings, normally the least theatrical of Washington’s venues. Environmental groups expressed relief. “FERC’s decision to ask the regional grid operators how they currently ensure a resilient grid is a reasonable first step,” said John Moore, who runs a “Sustainable FERC” coalition from the Natural Resources Defense Council. “A well-thought-out inquiry into resilience could help strengthen America’s electric grid. But that will happen only if FERC abandons the Trump administration’s inappropriate focus on aging and unneeded coal and nuclear plants, properly defines resilience and truly investigates how to build a 21st century electricity system,” Moore said. Glick was vehement in his criticism of Perry’s plan. “There is no evidence in the record,” he wrote, “to suggest that temporarily delaying the retirement of uncompetitive coal and nuclear generators would meaningfully improve the resilience of the grid.” Indeed, he said, the Department of Energy’s own staff study, performed at Perry’s urging, had concluded that the retirement of coal-fired power plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner renewables and natural gas “have not diminished the grid’s reliability or otherwise posed a significant and immediate threat to the resilience of the electric grid.” “To the contrary, the addition of a diverse array of generation resources, including natural gas, solar, wind, and geothermal, as well as maturing technologies, such as energy storage, distributed generation, and demand response, have in many respects contributed to the resilience of the bulk power system,” he argued. In a statement, Perry said that “a diverse fuel supply, especially with onsite fuel capability, plays an essential role in providing Americans with reliable, resilient and affordable electricity, particularly in times of weather-related stress like we are seeing now.” But Glick dismissed that argument, noting that “many coal and nuclear plants with significant on-site fuel supplies have failed to function during extreme weather events because those fuel supplies froze, flooded or were otherwise unavailable. In fact, initial reports indicate that coal-fired facilities accounted for nearly half of all forced outages in PJM during last week’s period of extreme temperatures.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-12-22T17:40:47-05:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil’s recent announcement that it will strengthen its climate risk disclosure is now playing into the oil giant’s prolonged federal court battle over state investigations into whether it misled shareholders. In a new court filing late Thursday, Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, one of two states investigating the company, argued that Exxon’s announcement amounted to an admission that the company had previously failed to sufficiently disclose the impact climate change was having on its operations. Healey’s 24-page filing urged U.S. District Court Judge Valerie E. Caproni to dismiss Exxon’s 18-month legal campaign to block investigations by her office and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s. Exxon agreed last week to disclose in more detail its climate risks after facing pressure from investors. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it wrote that those enhanced disclosures will include “energy demand sensitivities, implications of 2 degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.” Healey and her staff of attorneys seized on that SEC filing to suggest it added weight to the state’s investigation of Exxon. “This filing makes clear that, at a minimum, Exxon’s prior disclosures to investors, including Massachusetts investors, may not have adequately accounted for the effect of climate change on its business and assets,” Healey’s filing states. This is the latest round of legal maneuvering that erupted last year in the wake of subpoenas to Exxon by the two attorneys general. They want to know how much of what Exxon knew about climate change was disclosed to shareholders and potential investors. Coming at a point that the once fiery rhetoric between Exxon and the attorneys general appears to be cooling, it nonetheless keeps pressure on the oil giant. Exxon has until Jan. 12 to file replies with the court. In the documents filed Thursday, Healey and Schneiderman argue that Exxon’s attempt to derail their climate fraud investigations is a “baseless federal counter attack” and should be stopped in its tracks. “Exxon has thus attempted to shift the focus away from its own conduct—whether Exxon, over the course of nearly 40 years, misled Massachusetts investors and consumers about the role of Exxon products in causing climate change, and the impacts of climate change on Exxon’s business—to its chimerical theory that Attorney General Healey issued the CID (civil investigative demand) to silence and intimidate Exxon,” the Massachusetts filing states. Exxon maintains the investigations are an abuse of prosecutorial authority and encroach on Exxon’s right to express its own opinion in the climate change debate. Schneiderman scoffs at Exxon’s protests, noting in his 25-page filing that Exxon has freely acknowledged since",

    "content": "This story was updated Dec. 22 with President Trump signing the tax bill. The booming renewable energy industry breathed a wary sigh of relief as Congress voted this week on a sweeping tax bill that ended up preserving critical tax credits for wind energy, solar power and electric vehicles, though the industry still has serious concerns about other parts of the bill. As lawmakers worked over the past week to resolve issues between the House and Senate versions of the bill, the clean energy industry kept a keen eye out for details of the legislation, including provisions from the original House bill that would have weakened or eliminated the tax credits for renewables. By rejecting that approach, Republicans sent a message that they won’t back attempts to kneecap ongoing growth in renewables, despite pressure from the oil and gas industry to scale back incentives for clean energy. The credits have stoked growth in wind and solar, which for the first time this year provided 10 percent of the country’s electricity, while jobs in clean energy are among the fastest growing in the country. With costs for solar and wind generation continuing to plummet, along with the costs of large-scale batteries for energy storage, the industry appears poised for further growth. Even as the tax bill maintained the status quo for clean energy, however, it handed a major victory to the oil and gas industries, thanks to an unrelated provision that allows drilling in part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge—a longtime goal of many Republicans and pushed by Sen. Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska. The bill, signed by President Trump on Friday, maintained the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar, phasing them out according to a timeline agreed to by Congress in",

In October, the agency took the first step toward repealing the rule altogether, but that has raised the prospect of yet more legal challenges and prompted debate within the administration over how, exactly, to fulfill its obligation to regulate greenhouse gases.

    "content": "The auditing arm of Congress has warned that the military is failing to adequately plan for the risks that climate change poses to hundreds of overseas facilities, and that engineers at these sites rarely include foreseeable impacts in project designs. The Government Accountability Office, Congress’s nonpartisan oversight agency, wrote that while the Defense Department has identified that climate change and its effects will threaten many of its facilities, these installations are not consistently tracking costs they’re already incurring because of extreme weather. “As a result,” the report says, “the military services lack the information they need to adapt infrastructure at overseas installations to weather effects associated with climate change and develop accurate budget estimates for infrastructure sustainment.” The report, requested by a group of Senate Democrats and released on Wednesday, found that the Pentagon had exempted dozens of bases or other key sites from completing a department-wide climate vulnerability assessment. The authors also found that only a third of the 45 military installations they visited had incorporated climate change adaptation into their planning. The GAO concluded with a series of recommendations, including that the Pentagon should: A Defense Department response was included in the report with a letter signed by Lucian Niemeyer, who President Donald Trump nominated to be assistant secretary of defense for energy, installations and environment. It pushed back against some of the findings, stating that blaming infrastructure damage specifically on climate change is “speculative at best” and that “associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not warrant the time and money expended in doing so.” The response also accused the GAO of using outdated Defense Department policies, saying the Pentagon is in the process of updating the National Defense Strategy “to focus resources on threats considered to be critical to our nation’s security.” Many climate advocates and planners have praised the military for beginning to address climate change, including trying to assess and warn of the impacts it will have on national security. Global warming is expected to bring more severe weather and higher seas that will flood some bases, strain their water supplies, inhibit training exercises with extreme heat and, according to the Pentagon, worsen instability in parts of the globe. In some cases, these effects have already arrived. Wednesday’s report, however, suggests that the Pentagon has much more work to do. Naval Station Norfolk, the Navy’s largest base, already experiences regular tidal flooding that can block roads and parking lots and shut some of its piers. A",

    "date": "2017-11-29T15:48:00-05:00",
    "content": "This story was updated Nov. 29 with the Senate committee’s vote. More than 300 scientists wrote to the Senate on Tuesday opposing Kathleen Hartnett White’s nomination to the top White House environment post. They cited the importance of scientific integrity and wrote that they oppose her nomination “because one thing more dangerous than climate change is lying.” On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted to move her nomination forward to a full Senate vote, along with the nomination of Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist who President Donald Trump picked to be second in command at the Environmental Protection Agency. If the Senate confirms White as head the Council on Environmental Quality, it would place a fossil fuels industry supporter and vocal denier of mainstream climate science at the center of federal interagency policy discussions on energy and environment. White, a fellow of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation and former head of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, has written extensively against regulation of carbon dioxide, which she calls “the gas of life.” She has also written in favor of increasing the use of fossil fuels and has criticized the Endangered Species Act. “As scientists and scholars, we are alarmed by Ms. Hartnett White’s actions and statements, particularly, her recent assertion that carbon dioxide is not a harmful pollutant,” the scientists wrote in their letter to senators. “There is unanimous agreement across peer-reviewed climate science that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by human activities are contributing to the harmful effects of climate change. To state otherwise in the face of overwhelming evidence is simply unsupportable.” “This is not a partisan issue; it is a matter of defending scientific integrity,” the letter says. “Climate change threatens us all, regardless of political affiliation. Confirming Kathleen Hartnett White at the helm of the Council on Environmental Quality would have serious consequences for people and the ecosystems of the only planet that can support us.” Amanda Lynch, a climate scientist at Brown University and head of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, drafted the letter and began collecting signatures from colleagues after hearing White’s testimony at her Senate confirmation hearing in early November. “The thing that tipped me over the edge was her appearance before the Senate where she just couldn’t answer fundamental questions about environmental science that would affect her ability to do her job,” Lynch said. For example, White seemed to question whether warm water expands, which is basic physical science. When asked if the law of thermal expansion applies to sea water (starting at 9:39 in the video below), White replied: “Again, I do not have any kind of expertise or even much layman study of the ocean dynamics and the climate change issues.” Asked about her understanding of fossil fuels’ impact on oceans, White said: “I have a very superficial understanding as far as that. Acidification issues are one. I have not read widely or deeply.” Asked about her previous statements that carbon dioxide is not dangerous, White said at the hearing: “CO2 in the atmosphere has none of the characteristics of a pollutant that contaminates and fouls and all of that that can have direct impact on human health. As an atmospheric gas, it is a plant nutrient.” The person who becomes head of the Council on Environmental Quality will have an impact on the discourse in the White House, Lynch noted. “My hope is that there are some moderate Republicans that will take this into consideration when deciding whether to confirm her or not,” Lynch said. “It’s not a partisan issue. It’s a matter of fact. We need to start to treat it as such.” “My sense is that President Trump does not necessarily disbelieve the scientists when they talk about climate change, based on what he has said in decades past,” she said. “But it’s become a political football.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-11-17T21:13:14-05:00",
    "content": "The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s largest oil and gas trade organization, is dismissing the findings of a study on the risks facing African Americans who live near oil and gas facilities, saying that health disparities may be caused by other factors instead, including “genetics.” The study by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Clean Air Task Force found that more than 1 million African Americans live within a half-mile of oil and gas wells and operations, and another 6.7 million live in counties with refineries. They warned that African Americans face disproportionate exposure to pollution as a result. “I’ve read an NAACP paper released this week that accuses the natural gas and oil industry of emissions that disproportionately burden African American communities. As a scientist, my overall observation is that the paper fails to demonstrate a causal relationship between natural gas activity and the health disparities, reported or predicted, within the African American community,” wrote Uni Blake, a scientific adviser in regulatory and scientific affairs at API, in a blog post Thursday. “Rather, scholarly research attributes those health disparities to other factors that have nothing to do with natural gas and oil operations—such as genetics, indoor allergens and unequal access to preventative care,” the blog post said. The two organizations that produced the study defended it. “Above and beyond other factors, the oil and gas operations in communities causes an extra level of risk,” Jacqueline Patterson, director of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program for NAACP said. “Other people who live in those communities also have those health conditions that result from those exposures. That would discount the role of ‘genetics’.” “The data in our report looks at the cancer risk and health impacts of ozone smog among this population and so, if that population is more vulnerable because of these factors, then it is even more important to address aggravating factors that are easily avoidable like controlling unnecessary leaks from oil and gas infrastructure,” Lesley Fleischman, a Clean Air Task Force analyst and study co-author said. Robert Bullard, a professor of urban planning and environmental policy and administration of justice at Texas Southern University who is often referred to as the “father of environmental justice,” said API’s response is “an insult to the intelligence of not just African Americans but the intelligence of the American people who know better.” “The [API] folks that responded to the study are basically using the same argument [as the tobacco industry] that it’s not the chemicals and the oil and gas, but it’s people whose own behavior somehow drive the health disparities,” Bullard said. “It’s pushing blame off on individuals who live near these facilities and absolving these companies from any kind of responsibility.” The blog post said the focus should be on bringing people out of poverty, not “attacking our industry.” “The objective should be to address the underlying socio-economic factors that contribute to the disparities, and one of the best vehicles is via the good jobs the natural gas and oil industry support,” the API post said.

    "title": "‘No. I’m Not a Scientist’: Senators Press Trump Nominees on Climate Denial",
    "date": "2017-11-10T15:01:08-05:00",
    "content": "Two of President Donald Trump’s most controversial nominees for environment posts—one a coal industry lobbyist, the other a former Texas environmental official who dubbed carbon dioxide the “gas of life”—got a grilling from Senate Democrats in a confirmation hearing on Wednesday. During the hearing, Kathleen Hartnett White, a vocal supporter of the fossil fuel industry who has called the consensus on global warming a “kind of paganism,” and Andrew Wheeler, most recently a lobbyist for coal giant Murray Energy, responded to a battery of questions about climate change. “You aren’t a scientist, are you?” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), asked White, during one exchange at Wednesday’s hearing, held by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. “No. I’m not a scientist,” White responded. “But in my personal capacity, I have many questions that remain unanswered by current climate policy. I think we need to have more precise explanation of the human role and the natural role.” Trump nominated White in October to head the Council on Environmental Quality, the top environmental job in the White House. Environmental groups have blasted the nomination from the outset, calling White an anti-science apologist for the fossil fuel industry. As a fellow of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative Austin-based think tank that has been funded by fossil fuel interests, including Exxon and the Koch brothers, she has many published writings and interviews expressing her views. Trump nominated Wheeler to be second-in-command to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Wheeler, a former EPA employee, was also a long-time staff member on the committee who worked for Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the famously climate-denying lawmaker who once brought a snowball to the Senate floor in an attempt to disprove global warming. The committee’s Democrats on Wednesday fired away at White, questioning statements in her written work or radio interviews, one in which she told an interviewer that ozone isn’t harmful to human health “unless you put your mouth over the tailpipe of a car for eight hours.” The panel’s top-ranking Democrat, Tom Carper of Delaware, noted that White has compared “people who believe that carbon pollution is causing climate change” to pagans and communists, and has said that efforts to reduce carbon pollution would lead to “poverty, socialism and concentration camps.” Carper noted that international climate talks are underway in Bonn, Germany, and that Syria announced this week that it would sign on to the Paris Climate agreement, leaving the U.S. the only country that has expressed its intention to abandon the pact. “Mrs. White, do you really believe that the views of all those countries’ leaders are properly compared to ideologues, pagans and communists?” Carper asked. “No, I don’t,” White replied. “Those words or phrases were taken out of context.” The panel’s Democrats pressed Wheeler about his lobbying work with Murray Energy and his knowledge of a three-page document, reportedly given to Pruitt by Bob Murray, the company’s CEO, earlier this year. Murray has said some of the instructions in the document—seen as a plan to effectively defang the agency—have already been implemented. When asked by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), if he had seen the document, Wheeler said he had, but only “looked at it and handed it back” to Murray. “I think the American people are entitled to an EPA that is not following coal companies’ three-page plans, but is following wherever the best interests of the American people lead,” Whitehouse said. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) asked White and Wheeler about the Fourth National Climate Assessment—released last week by the Trump administration—pressing them on whether they accepted its findings. The assessment presents the government’s most convincing evidence that fossil fuels and human activity are driving climate change. “I view the report, really, as the product of the previous administration and not of this president,” White responded. “There are many differences, credible differences of opinion, among climate scientists.” Wheeler said he did not reject the report’s findings, but added, “I’ve not read the report yet, and since it’s open for notice and comment at this point, I don’t think I would pre-judge.” (The assessment consists of two volumes. The first volume, released in its final form last week, addresses the state of climate science and is no longer open for public comment.) The panel’s Republican members largely praised both nominees’ records and accused Democrats of overplaying climate change as an issue. White served a six-year term as chairman and commissioner of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality starting in",

    "title": "10 Senators Call for Investigation into EPA Pushing Scientists Off Advisory Boards",
    "date": "2017-11-10T15:22:27-05:00",
    "content": "A group of Senate Democrats is calling for an expanded investigation into efforts by the Trump Environmental Protection Agency to effectively push independent scientists off key EPA advisory boards and replace them with scientists from the fossil fuel and chemical industries. In a letter sent to the Government Accountability Office on Thursday, the 10 senators asked the GAO to investigate a new directive, issued by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt on Oct. 31, that restricts any scientist who has received EPA funding from serving on the agency’s scientific advisory panels. Pruitt said the move was intended to clear up conflicts of interest and to rid advisory panel members of financial ties to the agency. But scientific groups, academics and advocacy organizations have all pointed out that it will mean the most experienced scientists—whose qualifications earn them government grants in the first place—will no longer be able to serve in these roles. “The double-standard is striking: an academic scientist that receives an EPA grant for any purpose cannot provide independent advice on a completely different subject matter on any of EPA’s science advisory boards,” the senators wrote, “while industry scientists are presumed to have no inherent conflict even if their research is entirely funded by a company with a financial stake in an advisory board’s conclusions.” Five days after Pruitt issued the directive, The Washington Post reported that he appointed 66 new members to advisory panels, many of them with ties to industries the agency regulates. Several panel members stepped down. “Under this new policy, EPA will be replacing representatives of public and private universities including Harvard, Stanford, Ohio State University, and the University of Southern California with scientists who work for Phillips 66, Total, Southern Company, and the American Chemistry Council,” the senators wrote. In response to a request for comment, an EPA spokesperson replied: “The Administrator has issued a directive which clearly states his policy with regard to grantees.” The agency did not respond to questions about whether new members will be required to sign conflict of interest declarations or undergo a review process. Earlier this year, the EPA said it would not renew the terms of members of its broader Board of Scientific Counselors, and beyond EPA, the administration has allowed other scientific boards to expire altogether. In August, the acting head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) told members of an advisory panel for the National Climate Assessment that it would allow the panel’s charter to lapse. The recent Pruitt directive is similar to legislation long pushed by Republicans in Congress, including a bill introduced earlier this year called the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act. Science organizations have pointed out that anyone receiving a federal grant undergoes a merit review, which scrutinizes their professional standards and ethics, and that grant applicants have to declare they have no conflicts of interest before receiving government grants. “EPA’s decisions have real implications for the health and well-being of Americans and in some cases people worldwide,” wrote Chris McEntee, the executive director of the American Geophysical Union. “By curtailing the input of some of the most respected minds in science, Pruitt’s decision robs the agency, and by extension Americans, of a critically important resource.” The senators’ letter on Thursday follows a previous request to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, to investigate the EPA’s policies and procedures related to advisory panels.

    "date": "2017-10-26T21:41:05-04:00",
    "content": "A group of nurses who volunteered in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria gave harrowing accounts of what they saw in hospitals, homes and isolated towns there at a meeting with members of Congress on Thursday. “Children, hungry and sick, clinging to their crying mothers, who were begging for food to feed their families. Frail elders exposed to excessive heat and rain, desperate for drinking water and forced to make terrible choices to either suffer from severe dehydration or drink from contaminated rivers and streams that could also lead to death,” Cathy Kennedy, a registered nurse and Vice-President of National Nurses United, said recounting what she and others saw on the island. The ongoing crisis in Puerto Rico is surfacing many of the health risks associated with climate change—risks that are becoming more common as global temperatures rise and that are raising concerns across the nursing profession. This week, an international nursing society published a special-edition journal focused on those risks. It includes 11 studies detailing how climate change is exacerbating human health threats, including infectious and chronic disease, mental health, food security, disaster planning and social disparities, and how the nursing profession can address these emerging challenges. “Recent natural disasters have had considerable health consequences, including deaths in nursing homes and an extreme lack of access to medical services,” Eileen Sullivan-Marx, dean of New York University’s Rory Meyers College of Nursing and an editor of the special issue, said in a statement. “Now more than ever, it is critical that the nursing community work with other health professionals to plan for changing conditions.” The studies, published in the Journal of Nursing Scholarship by The Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau International, addressed a multitude of challenges that health providers face worldwide. One study focused on the health impacts of climate change–related water disasters: cyclones, hurricanes, and flooding events that have increased in frequency and severity due to rising global temperatures. The study, a comprehensive review of prior research, looked at a wide array of health effects, including mental health, and compared the psychological impacts in flooded and non-flooded homes following disasters. The people whose homes were flooded reported higher psychological distress and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms up to six months after the incident and were eight times more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression than those whose homes didn’t flood. “Climate change–related water disasters endanger our health by effectively destroying or contaminating our food and water sources, the weather we experience, and our interactions with the built and natural environments,” the authors wrote. “The increasing frequency and intensity of climate change–related water disasters pose new challenges to the control of environmental toxic exposures and emerging infectious diseases, and gradually increase the pressure on the natural, economic, social and health systems that sustain health.” Lead author Tener Goodwin Veenema, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, said the public health challenges that Puerto Rico faces following Hurricane Maria and the ongoing struggle to restore potable water, electricity and communication systems to the island represent a “worst case” scenario. “It is over a month out now,” she said. “We are still in our response phase but really want to be moving more toward recovery and really responding to the health and behavioral and mental health needs of all of the people on the island who are continuing to suffer.” Another study focused on social justice issues associated with climate change and human health. Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between",

    "content": "Climate change is dramatically increasing the risk of severe flooding from hurricanes in New York City, to the extent that what was a once-in-500-years flood when the city was founded could be expected every five years within a couple of decades. Throughout the century, of course, the risk of flooding increases as sea levels are expected to continue to rise. These are the findings of a study published today that modeled how climate change may affect flooding from tropical cyclones in the city. The increased risk, the authors found, was largely due to sea level rise. While storms are expected to grow stronger as the planet warms, models project that they’ll turn farther out to sea, with fewer making direct hits on New York. However, when sea level rise is added into the picture, “it becomes clear that flood heights will become much worse in the future,” said Andra J. Garner, a postdoctoral researcher at Rutgers University and the lead author of the study. The paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, combines the high-emissions scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with newer research that assumes more dramatic melting of Antarctic ice sheets to come up with a worst-case scenario for sea level rise. The projection shows waters surrounding New York rising anywhere from about 3 to 8 feet by",

The approach is a “sharp departure” from past practice, said Dan Fiorino, who worked for the agency for more than 30 years and is now director of the Center for Environmental Policy at American University. “It’s trying to manipulate journalists and favor those who say the right things,” Fiorino said. “Now, what we’re seeing from EPA is pretty much what we’re seeing from the administration. The press people are there to sell a very particular point of view. They’ll limit access.” Regardless of whether the president was a Republican or a Democrat, or whether his regulatory agenda was friendly to environmentalists or to business interests, the agency’s press office generally tried to appear neutral. When the EPA was still relatively young, its administrator—William Ruckelshaus, who was on a mission to rescue the agency from its own missteps—issued what’s become known as the “fishbowl memo.” The",

    "content": "The auditing arm of Congress says the costs of climate change are likely to soar in the decades ahead, and it is urging the federal government to get a better grip on the risks to the economy and to the federal budget. The Government Accountability Office, in a report issued on Tuesday, cited a range of research concluding that the costs of worsening droughts, floods, wildfires, heat waves and storms will run into hundreds of billions of dollars and threaten many parts of the economy, while hitting some regions particularly hard. But so far, it said, too little is being done to understand and defend against the dangers. “Even with the magnitude of these disaster recovery costs, the federal government does not have government-wide strategic planning efforts in place to help set clear priorities for managing significant climate risks before they become federal fiscal exposures,” the report says. Already, the report noted, direct costs to the federal government for expenses like firefighting, flood insurance and payments for lost crops have come to about $350 billion in the past decade. (The figures don’t include tens of billions yet to be paid for the latest season of storms and fires; and the costs inflicted across the whole economy are much bigger than those reflected in the federal budget.)

Putting her in charge of the Council on Environmental Quality, which has been rudderless since Trump took office, would place an extreme denier of mainstream climate science, a hero of those who oppose urgent action on global warming, at the fulcrum of federal interagency policy discussions on energy and environmental matters. White has argued against the federal government’s “endangerment finding” that carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas feeding worldwide climate change, is a danger to human health and the environment. If confirmed to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, she would be coordinating environmental efforts across the federal agencies. As a fellow of the conservative Austin-based think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, White leaves a long paper trail that will surely be fodder for her confirmation hearing. The group has been funded by fossil fuel interests, including Exxon and the Koch brothers. She has decried regulation of carbon dioxide, which she calls “the gas of life,” and co-authored last year’s paean to the fracking boom, “Fueling Freedom: Exposing the Mad War on Energy.” Her co-author, economist Stephen Moore, founded the Club for Growth, the political action group that weaponized the primary process to successfully move the Republican party to the right over the past two decades. “An invisible, harmless trace gas in the Earth’s atmosphere, CO2 is a plant food,” White said last year in a Q&A with the Orlando Sentinel.

    "content": "This story was updated on Oct. 11 with federal regulators’ response to requests to extend the comment period. In two important policy moves, Scott Pruitt and Rick Perry are both seeking to defend the same fiefdom: coal’s dwindling domain as the ruling fuel for electric utility companies. They’re on the same crusade, but with rather different strategies. Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, chose a war of attrition, while Perry, the energy secretary, mounted a blitzkreig. Pruitt’s order on Monday to revoke the Clean Power Plan and its controls on carbon dioxide emissions from the nation’s coal-fired power plants displayed no rush to replace the rule. That would have to wait—it’s not clear how long—for a review of whether any such regulation was even needed, let alone how it would work. In contrast, Perry’s order last month telling federal regulators to help rescue coal-fired power plants from the crippling competition of natural gas and renewables was framed as such an emergency that an arcane set of new rules ought to be rushed into effect, with only the briefest review and public comment. Hurry up and wait, as soldiers call this dichotomy. But either way, critics say coal’s last stand is a lost cause. “The problem of climate change isn’t going away, and all they are buying now is some delay,” said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He says the Clean Air Act is here to stay, as is the Supreme Court’s repeated conclusion that the law requires EPA to regulate emissions of dangerous greenhouse gases from power plants and other big sources. Like others, his group plans to sue. New York’s energy czar, Richard Kauffman, suggested the state would oppose both Perry and Pruitt and press forward with its clean energy goals. Kauffman, who is in the midst of restructuring New York’s grid, said the state should be “building the new grid and not rebuilding the old grid.” “I don’t think it changes any other market factors that are pushing coal out of the system,” said John Larsen, a director of the Rhodium Group, which studies the power markets. A new analysis of what lies ahead for coal, issued by the Union of Concerned Scientists, said it will “almost certainly continue” to fade away. “Utilities are already planning to retire another 13 percent of the nation’s coal generating capacity. An additional 5 percent will either retire or convert to natural gas,” the report said. “Beyond those already slated for retirement or conversion, a further 20 percent of",

    "date": "2017-09-22T18:52:04-04:00",
    "content": "The stage is nearly set for the Trump administration to slap tariffs on imported solar panels, after the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled on Friday that two bankrupt solar manufacturers had been harmed by the flood of competition from overseas. But the surge of low-cost panels from China and elsewhere, which the ITC said harmed manufacturers Suniva and SolarWorld, has been a boon to American consumers, making power from the Sun much more affordable. Installers and financiers of solar power systems have warned that a Trump administration effort to protect the moribund U.S. manufacturers would undercut the market, forcing sharp price increases after years of price declines for photovoltaic energy. And that, they warned, would also put tens of thousands of U.S. jobs and billions of dollars of investment at risk. Aside from shaking up an intensely competitive industry, what does this tangled trade case mean for the homeowner who has been hoping—some day, when the price is right—to go solar? The short answer: It’s complicated. But the decision that the manufacturers have been injured does not necessarily mean that you can’t go right ahead and add those panels to your roof. A host of other factors—your state’s electricity prices and policies, the appeal of federal tax breaks and local subsidies, and your ability to connect with an installer who can explain the ins and outs of a purchase or a lease—might be as important as trade policy decisions in Washington. The ITC ruling is one step in a process that will last for at least another month. The ITC has to take up the question of what penalties to recommend—a hearing is set for October 3—and issue recommendations, expected in November. The Trump administration then has the final decision. In the meantime, here are a few of the issues for consumers to ponder: Expect sticker shock if the Trump administration imposes the kind of temporary tariff and price floor that Suniva has proposed.

    "title": "Exxon Promises to Cut Methane Leaks from U.S. Shale Oil and Gas Operations",
    "date": "2017-09-25T12:24:01-04:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil said on Monday that it would take a series of steps to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from its U.S. onshore oil and gas production. The measures will include upgrading equipment and finding and repairing leaks. The announcement comes as the Trump administration is working to postpone and review federal rules that would require similar steps across the industry. Oil and gas trade groups sued to block those rules, saying they were too costly. Now, some environmentalists say Exxon’s move undermines that argument. “At a time when there are some companies making the argument that the sky is going to fall if they’re required to take sensible action to reduce methane emissions, you have the nation’s largest oil and gas producer simply moving ahead,” said Mark Brownstein, vice president for climate and energy at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It begins to send a signal to both others in industry and frankly the policymakers that these sorts of things are doable,” he said. Exxon didn’t disclose how many tons of methane emissions its voluntary measures might prevent. But Brownstein said that based on Exxon’s announcement, the steps could go even farther than the federal rules require, because they would apply to both new and existing facilities on private lands as well as public lands. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a potent short-lived climate pollutant that is 28 to 34 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2 over the course of a century. It accounts for about 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the oil and gas sector is the largest source in this country. The Obama administration had tried to address this in part by passing two rules to limit emissions—one through the EPA that applies nationwide but only to new operations, and another, through the Bureau of Land Management, that applies to new and existing operations on federal lands. The Trump administration has said it’s reviewing the rules, and it is widely expected to weaken them. The BLM has postponed its rule for two years, while the EPA has proposed doing the same. Environmentalists and some states have sued to overturn the delays. In May, the Senate rejected an attempt to repeal the BLM rule. In its announcement, Exxon said that over three years it would phase out the use of “high-bleed” valves, which regulate pressure in equipment by venting gas to the atmosphere, at its subsidiary XTO Energy, which operates its shale and other unconventional drilling. It also said it would develop new technology to better detect leaks and expand training and the sharing of best practices. Exxon made no mention of climate change in the announcement and did not give a reason for the moves beyond characterizing them as an expansion of its existing program to reduce emissions “as a matter of safety and environmental responsibility.” XTO Energy President Sara Ortwein wrote that the decision to reduce methane emissions followed years of research and testing. Brownstein, whose group has worked with Exxon to study methane emissions, said it’s in the company’s long-term interest to limit emissions. “Any company with an investment time horizon greater than a year has to know that ultimately, managing methane emissions is going to be part of the business agenda,” he said. Last month, Politico reported that some executives and lobbyists in the oil and gas industry are concerned that the Trump administration’s regulatory rollback may be too aggressive and could risk sparking a backlash, particularly if there is a major accident or spill.

    "date": "2017-09-17T14:15:00-04:00",
    "content": "More than two weeks after a plea from the mayor of Port Arthur, Texas—“Our whole city is under water”—went viral, thousands of flooded-out residents remained homeless, and community leaders, angry with the speed of the federal government’s response, were considering a former youth correctional facility for housing. The government began installing large, temporary tents for groups of residents to stay in while more permanent arrangements could be made. In the weeks after the storm, residents had struggled to find housing. “They are living wherever they can lay their heads at this particular point—garages, with relatives, with friends, in cars, you name it,” Hilton Kelley, director of Community in Power and Development Association, said. “Infants, the handicapped are also homeless. We have a lot of elderly folks; all of them are homeless.” Flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Harvey forced residents of the largely African American community to evacuate their homes, as well as the city’s emergency shelter, after 26 inches of rain fell on August 29. Port Arthur’s residents have long struggled with environmental issues. Toxic air emissions from refineries that surround the city, including the largest oil refinery in the country, routinely release pungent emissions that cause residents eyes and noses to sting. Now, an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 residents in the town of 55,000 are displaced. Many of them were evicted from low-income rental units that are now being gutted to prevent mold growth following the flood. Amid the intense frustration and deprivation after the storm, community leaders are at odds with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over the speed of federal aid to their city, saying FEMA is to blame for the failure to provide adequate housing. “We were delayed because we were not put on the housing list, it was just Tuesday that the order came down that they were going to release the funds for emergency housing for the city of Port Arthur,” Kelley said. “We were somehow left off the damn list.” FEMA spokesman Robert Howard said Jefferson County, which includes Port Arthur, was approved for FEMA assistance starting on Aug. 30, and that all disaster housing assistance was available to Jefferson County residents at that time. The agency had provided $12 million in assistance to 20,092 residents in Jefferson County as of Sept. 11, he said. Port Arthur officials say additional housing assistance wasn’t made available to them until Sept. 12. “Typically under lesser circumstances they are able to place survivors in hotels and apartments and other rental facilities, but because the damage was so widespread, they had to enact these other housing options,” City of Port Arthur spokesperson LaRisa Carpenter said. Port Arthur is also disadvantaged by its size when it comes to securing federal assistance. While a large city like Houston has teams of employees trained in the bureaucratic technicalities of dealing with FEMA, Port Arthur has a small staff scrambling to deal with extraordinary demands amid the flooding. “It’s local governments’ responsibility to plug in and tell the state what they want but not all local governments are as resourced as major metropolitan areas like Houston and Galveston,” said Lillie Coney, legislative director for U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). FEMA has to “have some resource in place to help them with the administrative burden of being able to plug in and do the things they need to do, especially a place like Port Arthur that was completely under water,” she said. Finding temporary housing for the residents of Port Arthur has not been easy. City officials working with FEMA arranged for two barges, with berths for approximately 600 individuals, to provide temporary housing earlier this week. Inspection of the World War II-era barges by the U.S. Coast Guard, however, found safety issues, including missing guardrails, and permits for the barges were denied, causing further outrage from the community. “They are playing games with the lives of thousands of African Americans here in the city of Port Arthur,” Kelley said. “I do believe that if this was a more affluent community that we would be seeing immediate action. We would see tents up, we would see trailers rolling in, and yet, now we are playing games with two raggedy barges that the Coast Guard would not even let be towed to the city of Port Arthur.” Michael Sinegal, a county commissioner for Jefferson County said he is working with FEMA on other potential housing options, including tents, some of which are now going up, vacant stores and a former juvenile correction facility in the nearby town of Nederland, that could provide temporary housing. Others have objected to the later option because it looks like a prison, but the county is running out of options, Sinegal said. “With the housing needs we have, if we have to put some daisies around it and dress it up a little bit, if it’s the only option we have, we need to use it.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-09-07T19:43:13-04:00",
    "content": "[UPDATE: On Sept. 15, FERC overrode New York’s decision on the Valley Lateral Project, stating that New York officials had missed a deadline to act. Bloomberg BNA discusses that move and the likelihood that the state will appeal, here.] It might be getting harder to win approval for new fossil fuel projects without first examining their impacts on climate change. Last week, regulators in New York rejected key permits for a natural gas pipeline, saying a previous federal approval had failed to consider the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. The pipeline in question, the 7.8 mile-long Valley Lateral Project, would supply a 680 megawatt power plant that’s currently under construction. The pipeline had already received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), but because it crosses several streams and wetlands, it needed state regulators to sign off, too. In a letter to FERC on Aug. 30, Thomas Berkman, deputy commissioner and general counsel at the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, wrote that federal regulators had “failed to consider or quantify the indirect effects” of the emissions produced when the fuel shipped through the pipeline is eventually burned. The state cited a federal court ruling issued just one week earlier as its justification for denying the permits. In that case, a federal circuit court in Washington, D.C., rejected an approval by FERC of a separate pipeline in the Southeast, saying “FERC must either quantify and consider the project’s downstream carbon emissions or explain in more detail why it cannot do so.” Berkman wrote that that court decision constitutes “a material change in applicable law” and that the commission should therefore reexamine the Valley Lateral application. Courts or regulators have blocked fossil fuel projects several times in the past month, at least in part because federal agencies failed to account for downstream climate emissions. On Aug. 14, a federal district judge in Montana rejected a proposed expansion of a coal mine in that state, saying the U.S. Department of Interior hadn’t adequately considered climate and other impacts. New York’s denial of the permit is the latest in a series of decisions by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration to block natural gas projects since he banned hydraulic fracturing in the state in",

    "title": "Perry’s Grid Study Calls for Easing Pollution Rules on Power Plants",
    "date": "2017-08-24T12:39:35-04:00",
    "content": "A rush study on the reliability of the nation’s electric grid ordered by Secretary of Energy Rick Perry concedes that the rapid increase of clean, cheap solar and wind power hasn’t thrown the power network out of kilter. Even so, the report puts the Trump administration’s thumb on the policy scales, recommending easing pollution regulations and changing rules for pricing of electricity, along with other steps intended to protect the beleaguered coal industry’s historical role as the foundation of the entire grid. Nowhere in the report is there any discussion of the main justification for propelling more carbon-free electricity into the market: the risk of catastrophic climate change if a business-as-usual grid, powered predominantly by fossil fuels, is allowed to function without regard to the costs of global warming it would create. Instead, in a brief paragraph wedged without elaboration into its recommendations, it adopts the administration’s bumper-sticker slogan of “energy dominance” as a key consideration in maintaining electric reliability. Calling this “an approach to promote the clean and safe development of energy resources while at the same time minimizing regulatory barriers to energy production,” it said the Energy Department should move “broadly and quickly” toward rescinding energy and climate policies of the past and reviewing key environmental regulations. Notably, the report calls for easing up on the requirement that coal plants upgrade their pollution controls when they modernize—as required by the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists immediately declared that they would fight any such move in court. The report also calls for changes in pricing regulations that could reward coal plants with payments for providing standby power and for buffering the grid against brief power fluctuations. It said that negative pricing should be discouraged, tamping down a quirk in the system that can reduce wholesale prices to less than zero, which penalizes operators of costly fossil fuel plants when the sun is shining brightly and the wind is blowing briskly. Without flatly calling for rolling back state renewable energy targets, as Perry has hinted, the study blames them, as well as competition from cheap gas and the rising costs of pollution protections, for much of the shift away from coal. David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, which has been following the grid study process, said the “fingerprints of political appointees with ties to the fossil fuel industry” were all over the report, compared with a leaked earlier version that had been drafted by Department of Energy staff. “The topline recommendations don’t reflect the evidence that they’ve presented, and instead they reflect what’s consistently been a pro-coal agenda of President Trump,” he said. Ever since Perry commissioned the study, assigning oversight of the task to a pro-fossil-fuel stalwart, it has been seen by renewable energy advocates as a thinly veiled attempt to bolster coal. But its immediate effect is likely to be as slight as the transitory moment earlier in the week when the eclipse cast the moon’s shadow onto millions of solar rooftops without even flickering the nation’s lightbulbs. Mostly, the study released on Aug. 23 recommends modest steps—studies, research and careful attention by grid operators to the trend away from coal, which it does not claim can be reversed. “Ultimately, the continued closure of traditional baseload power plants calls for a comprehensive strategy for long-term reliability and resilience,” the study said. Once the dominant fuel, coal’s share of electricity has been severely pressured by cheap natural gas, declining demand for power, pollution controls, nascent prices on carbon emissions, state renewable mandates, consumer preferences and booming wind and solar power. The latter, as their costs plummet, have been given an extra edge by tax subsidies. As the outlook for coal continues to darken, its advocates increasingly have argued that too widespread a reliance on variable power from wind and solar would begin to undercut the reliability of supply. The industries that produce the clean energy at issue said this concern has been exaggerated. “The increasing use of renewable energy has made the nation’s electrical grid more robust and secure,” said Gregory Wetstone of the American Council on Renewable Energy. ”Certainly, we would be concerned by any effort to use resiliency as an excuse for propping up uneconomic sources of electrical power.” Policy analyst Mike O’Boyle of Energy Innovation noted that the report “focuses a great deal on a need to study and value resilience attributes provided by baseload coal and nuclear units, but it speaks far less about valuing flexibility, which helps compensate for missing baseload generation.” Flexibility includes demand response and energy storage, which has been growing alongside renewable energy. In a cover letter with the study, Perry wrote that “the core objective of electricity regulation has always been, and should continue to be, to ensure a reliable and resilient electric supply system that serves customers in an equitable manner.” He claimed “it is apparent that in today’s competitive markets certain regulations and subsidies are having a large impact on the functioning of markets, and thereby challenging our power generation mix.” His perspective ignores that the power industry is a leading source of many kinds of pollution, including soot and smog, acid rain, toxics, hazardous wastes and carbon dioxide—and that regulations of the grid are not just aimed at enhancing its benefits, but also at protecting people from dangers. The new study calls for reviving futile attempts by the Bush-Cheney administration 15 years ago to roll back an important protection of the Clean Air Act, a permitting rule called “new source review,” that requires companies to install state of the art pollution controls when they modernize plants. It said the Environmental Protection Agency should “allow coal-fired plants to improve efficiency and reliability without triggering new regulatory approvals and associated costs.” If the rules “would allow for improvement of the existing fleet,” it said, the Energy Department would target research on technologies that would increase the efficiency of outmoded existing coal plants, which are those that have been retired by the hundreds in recent years. In a detailed response on Twitter, John Walke of the NRDC said that what Perry was proposing was plainly illegal. The group has been among those suing the Trump administration for various attempts to roll back pollution regulations in favor of the fossil fuel industries. “A dirty coal plant is not ‘more efficient’ when it emits MORE NOx, SO2, PM2.5, Hg, lead, arsenic, benzene, acid gases, heavy metals & CO2,” Walke tweeted, abbreviating the names of the main pollutants that endanger public health—and the global climate.

    "date": "2017-08-28T23:05:54-04:00",
    "content": "The EPA’s Office of  is launching an audit of Administrator Scott Pruitt’s frequent travel to his home state of Oklahoma this year to assess whether he has violated agency policies. The announcement followed a request by members of Congress and an independent investigation that showed Pruitt had spent nearly half his time this spring traveling home, largely at the taxpayers’ expense. In July, the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group founded by former EPA employees, released a report detailing Pruitt’s frequent trips to Oklahoma. It found he had spent 48 days traveling during a 92-day period in March, April and May, with 43 of those days either in or on the way to and from Oklahoma. His calendar, which the group obtained with a Freedom of Information Act request, said Pruitt met with several industry and conservative groups, including the Oklahoma Well Strippers Association and the Heritage Foundation. Eric Schaeffer, the watchdog group’s executive director and a former director of civil enforcement at the EPA, said at the time that the report showed Pruitt is “more focused on cultivating his relationships with industry and conservative political organizations in his home state of Oklahoma than he is on protecting the environment and the public health for the rest of America.” The audit, announced Monday, comes in response to requests by several Democrats in the House and Senate, including Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. of New Jersey, ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. A letter announcing the audit says it will examine how frequently Pruitt has traveled and at what cost, as well as whether he and his staff and security detail followed EPA travel procedures. It also will examine whether those procedures “are sufficiently designed to prevent fraud, waste and abuse with the administrator’s travel that included trips to Oklahoma.” Pruitt’s calendar noted several interviews and meetings with unspecified people in the state. It also showed that Pruitt often listed just one or two events for trips that lasted three days. The report said airfare for Pruitt alone—not his security detail—totaled more than $12,000 in taxpayer funding. Pruitt paid for some of the travel, including a flight to Tulsa from Houston, where he met with an economic consulting group. In an email, Amy Graham, an EPA spokesperson, rejected speculation that the travel was political. “Administrator Pruitt is traveling the country to hear directly from the people impacted by EPA’s regulations outside of the Washington bubble,” she said. “This is nothing more than a distraction from the administrator’s significant environmental accomplishments.” The Environmental Integrity Project welcomed today’s announcement. “We are glad that the EPA Office of  is looking into this issue, to determine whether taxpayer funds were spent appropriately,” Sylvia Lam, an attorney with the group, said in a statement. The audit is being conducted by the ’s forensic audits office, which, according to its annual plan, “is responsible for conducting financial audits of EPA assistance agreements and contracts to identify potentially fraudulent actions,” as well as determining “acceptability of costs claimed under specific financial instruments.” The letter announcing the audit says work will begin this week.

    "date": "2017-08-14T16:45:41-04:00",
    "content": "Would an intervention by Washington to save this industry end up destroying it? That’s the question confronting the solar industry as the U.S. International Trade Commission meets this week on a petition to protect domestic manufacturers with tariffs on solar panel imports and price supports. The commission will hear competing views at a meeting on August 15 and has said it will make a preliminary ruling in late September on whether the petitioners, a pair of domestic manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy, have been so badly injured by imports that they need relief. The case is unusually complex, and it’s hard to know what relief the ITC and, ultimately, the Trump administration may impose. (As Bloomberg News noted in June, Trump’s instincts are to protect domestic manufacturers, and he is more fond of the coal industry than of solar.) The trade petition was filed after Suniva, which had been taken over by a foreign firm, filed this year for bankruptcy; it was joined by SolarWorld, another foreign-controlled and bankrupt company. Most of the rest of the domestic solar industry—including some other manufacturers but mainly those who install and finance solar gear and can thrive on cheap systems from abroad—is lined up against the petition. Their business has been booming as costs have steadily declined, making it easier for consumers, businesses and power companies to shift from fossil-fuel electricity. Hundreds of workers from the industry are expected to attend the hearing, pressing the case that the economic harm from protectionism would far outweigh the benefits. On Friday, a bipartisan group of senators sent an open letter to the ITC urging the commission to reject the petition. “Increasing costs will stop solar growth dead in its tracks, threatening tens of thousands of American workers in the solar industry and jeopardizing billions of dollars in investment in communities across the country,” the senators wrote. Opponents cite a recent study by Greentech Media that found that the protective relief sought by the petition “would strike a devastating blow to the U.S. solar market, erasing two-thirds of installations expected to come online over the next five years.” In rebuttal, the petitioners turned to analysts who issued a report claiming much the opposite: that relief would result in a “net gain in employment of at least between 114,796 and 144,298 jobs for the U.S. solar industry” over the next five years. Forecasts for the growth of solar electricity have never been very reliable. They are especially difficult now. Congress passed a law that over the next few years will phase out most of the tax subsidies that make it cheaper to install solar power. That would be happening just as the temporary tariffs and price supports kick in if Suniva and SolarWorld win their case. Among the unpredictable factors: the rapid pace of innovation and the intense competition in the global marketplace, the economies of scale that develop as solar power becomes ever cheaper, and policies around the world supporting solar. It all makes a big difference in a world trying to head off climate change caused by fossil fuel emissions of greenhouse gases. Although the U.S. hardly dominates the global solar marketplace—China is a much bigger supplier of equipment, and its installed solar capacity is growing much faster than America’s—any big change in solar incentives or penalties in the U.S. will be felt.

    "title": "Suniva, Seeking Tariffs on Foreign Solar Panels, Faces Tough Questions from ITC",
    "date": "2017-08-16T12:22:06-04:00",
    "content": "At a federal hearing Tuesday to decide whether domestic makers of solar panels need tariff protection from imports, members of the U.S. International Trade Commission focused much of their questioning on why these companies had failed as the overall solar market was booming. Was the reason, as solar panel manufacturers Suniva and SolarWorld complained, that they were overwhelmed by a tide of inexpensive imports—and that this could be remedied by a period of stiff tariffs and sharply increased prices? Or was it, as the petition’s critics asserted, that the domestic producers had crippled themselves through a series of strategic errors and bad decisions—and that rewarding them with protection would only damage the rest of the industry? The hearing was so crowded that the audience spilled into two overflow rooms, including many solar installers in bright yellow and orange T-shirts that stood out among the business attire of the lobbyists, lawyers and entrepreneurs who typically attend this kind of technical proceeding. Even as solar factory workers have lost their jobs, the industry’s rooftop workforce has boomed in recent years, along with those who build and maintain solar installations for utilities, big commercial customers and the like. That big workforce thrives on cheap supplies, and it has drawn the attention of politicians, who were also there to weigh in. In what the commission chair said was unusual for an ITC hearing, a number of state officials and lawmakers testified against the imposition of tariffs. A Republican from North Carolina, a Democrat from Maryland and a bipartisan team of legislators from Minnesota argued that their state’s thriving solar industries would be harmed by a trade move that increased the costs of panels. The lone local official testifying in favor of solar tariffs was the Mayor of Norcross, Georgia, Bucky Johnson, who urged the commission to help his city’s one-time success story, Suniva. “Some might say it’s protection, but I say bunk,” he said. But Sen. David Purdue, a Georgia Republican, was one of a bipartisan group of 16 U.S. senators who submitted a letter in opposition to tariffs. A coalition called the Energy Trade Action Coalition, including conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council and utilities like Southern Company, also opposed the tariffs. With so many competing interests on hand, the hearing extended into the evening. The ITC is supposed to decide by Sept. 22 whether the domestic industry was in fact brought to its knees by imported goods, and then to take up the question of whether a temporary tariff would be the right response. Ultimately, the question will be decided by President Donald Trump, making this also a key test case of his anti-import, pro-manufacturing agenda, as well as his energy and climate change policies. Environmental advocates have warned that the blossoming solar industry, which is supported by tax credits that make panels more affordable, would be snuffed out by tariffs, which might double the costs of some installations. It was hard to gauge the commissioners’ sentiments—the panel is independent and bipartisan—but their questioning delved into the objections posed by most of the solar industry to the petition presented by Suniva and SolarWorld, two bankrupt companies, both owned by foreign firms. Commission Chair Rhonda Schnare Schmidtlein, a Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, and the other Democrat on the commission, Irving A. Williamson, appointed by President George W. Bush, seemed intent on exploring what other factors might have impaired the domestic panel makers. “I want to understand how prices are set in this market,” Schmidtlein said. Aside from cheap imports, she suggested, other factors might be raw material prices and subsidies for solar installations. “Are you saying those factors never impact the price of modules here in the United States?” “Certainly these factors play some limited role,” said Thomas Brightbill, a lawyer for SolarWorld. “Our main point is that if you track the trend, there’s no correlation with what’s happened with solar prices with natural gas prices, or with raw material and polysilicon prices, or what’s happened with government incentives.” Schmidtlein also noted the ITC had looked at the issue how foreign competition was affecting U.S. solar manufacturers before. And although the U.S. Department of Commerce ordered countervailing duties on imports from China and Taiwan in",

    "date": "2017-08-09T12:44:20-04:00",
    "content": "The final draft of the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s Climate Science Special Report, prepared and meticulously peer reviewed by dozens of federal climate scientists and academic consultants, is as weighty as it is stark. And after an eleventh-hour leak to The New York Times, it may become as definitive as the thoroughly footnoted body of science it encompasses. Overwhelming evidence, the report says, shows that manmade climate change is being felt every day, and is worsening fast. The U.S. Global Change Research Program, an interagency umbrella group that the Trump administration has moved to deprive of significant financing, made no bones on crucial elements of the modern scientific consensus on climate change: None of this should come as any surprise—the report is basically a synthesis of the current climate science consensus. Indeed, its gist had been known for months. An early draft was released for public comment a month before President Obama left office. It was reviewed in detail by an expert panel at the National Academy of Sciences, the gold standard for peer review, which gave its imprimatur in April. But now, the final draft—the fifth revision, approaching 700 pages—is ready for final approval by the Trump Administration, which includes environmental, energy and other regulatory agencies run by people deeply opposed to the mainstream scientific views that run through this report, chapter and verse. Would the Trump Administration deep-six the report? Some scientists involved in the process reportedly were worried about that. So someone arranged to get it published on the website of The New York Times—a leak that broke protocol but ensured that no last-minute blue pencils could be surreptitiously applied by anyone politically inspired to meddle with the opus, a part of a long formal process that by law produces a National Climate Assessment every four years. There have, after all, been cases where that happened in past Republican administrations—and the one in power now is so outright opposed to much of the science presented here that the watchdogs were wide awake. Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that “federal scientists’ concerns that the administration will try to change or suppress this report are well-founded. The Trump administration has consistently demonstrated its lack of regard for science and evidence, including on climate change.” The White House said it would not comment on the draft until it was approved for release, and it criticized how the Times had put it out. Starting on Monday night, the newspaper published a story apparently based at first on an earlier, third draft that had been released last year for public comment and expert review; then, on Tuesday, it published the full text of the fifth and final draft, which was just completed in late June. The two differed in the wording of significant sections, but not in their overall thrust. Publication of the third draft, since it had long been available, didn’t constitute a leak. But publication of the fifth and final draft did, and effectively foreclosed any unnoticed, last-minute changes by political appointees who the Times reported were supposed to complete their review by August 18. Any editing that has occurred so far is of the kind that is normal for peer-reviewed science. That it occurred transparently—partly by design, partly by the artifice of a leak—only serves to underscore the insistence by established climate scientists that understanding of the causes of climate change and the urgent need for action to address it are well founded. That’s why most scientists dismiss suggestions by some in the administration, such as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, that some kind of “red team” exercise to challenge the existing consensus would be useful. Some may consider the Times-published version to be definitive, although depending on what happens next, others may dispute its authority. Those who oppose strong action on climate, for example, might seek to underscore that this report carries no direct regulatory authority. Even so, the publication of this fifth edition lays down a marker. It would be hard, for example, for any revisionist to try to undo the EPA’s landmark “endangerment finding” that underpins regulations of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act without taking into account the findings that are so completely laid out here.

    "date": "2017-08-02T10:01:00-04:00",
    "content": "An internal review by the Environmental Protection Agency has found that its administrator did not violate its scientific integrity policy when he contradicted a fundamental tenet of climate science by denying that carbon dioxide pollution is the principal agent of global warming. The policy “explicitly protects differing opinions” held by any agency employee, including Administrator Scott Pruitt, on any matter of science informing agency policy decisions, said a review panel convened by the EPA’s Scientific Integrity Committee. The panel addressed its finding to the Sierra Club, which had filed a complaint after Pruitt, whose views of climate science often skirt around the mainstream consensus on the causes and the urgency of the climate crisis, said in a television interview that he “would not agree” that carbon dioxide “is a primary contributor to the warming that we’re seeing.” “The freedom to express one’s opinion about science is fundamental to EPA’s Scientific Integrity Policy even (and especially) when that point of view might be controversial,” wrote Thomas Sinks, an agency science official, in a letter to the Sierra Club. In a caustic thread dissecting the letter on Twitter, John Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council called it a “gambit” designed to give Pruitt and other agency officials “the right to have wackadoodle beliefs tolerated as ‘opinion’.” The intense argument is over a momentary, if brazen, moment of public climate denial, a seemingly offhand answer to a simplistic question on the business cable channel CNBC. But it goes to the heart of one of the crucial matters on Pruitt’s extensive deregulatory agenda: whether the agency ought to stand by its scientific determination under President Obama that carbon dioxide is a harmful pollutant that must by law be regulated under the Clean Air Act. (Energy Secretary Rick Perry has said much the same thing, and the two are hardly alone in an administration replete with climate deniers of various shades.) The ruling comes at a time of mounting dissent among government scientists and President Donald Trump’s political appointees at the EPA and also at the Interior Department, the Energy Department, the Agriculture Department and elsewhere. One manifestation came this week when a 30-year EPA veteran, Elizabeth Southerland—a career scientist—left the agency with a stinging, personal blast at Pruitt and his policies, which she called “a temporary triumph of myth over truth.” In a resignation letter posted by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, she declared: “The truth is there is NO war on coal, there is NO economic crisis caused by environmental protection, and climate change IS caused by man’s activities.” The irony is that the plainest of truths are under assault while the protections afforded those who insist on speaking them to the powerful are co-opted by those whose views are most readily demonstrated to be false. In this setting, mainstream scientists are frustrated that it’s hard for them to get a hearing, and anxious that Pruitt is contemplating a “red-team, blue-team” scientific tug-of-war as a way of amplifying the kind of dubious claims he’s being challenged over. In a letter about this notion sent to Pruitt on Monday, leaders of 16 scientific societies cautioned that “the integrity of the scientific process cannot thrive when policymakers—regardless of party affiliation—use policy disagreements as a pretext to challenge scientific conclusions.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-07-27T21:59:09-04:00",
    "content": "This story has been updated with the final House vote. The U.S. House of Representatives brushed aside Democrats’ efforts to preserve federal funding for clean energy and energy efficiency as it voted to approve a large spending bill Thursday that would slash those programs by 45 percent while maintaining federal support for fossil energy research and development. The GOP-led House tucked its $9 billion federal energy spending plan into its so-called “minibus” budget bill, a catch-all package to fund one-quarter of the federal government when the new fiscal year begins in October. The bill, dubbed the “Making America Secure Again Act,” is a long way from final approval. The Senate still must vote on its own bills to fund the Pentagon, the Department of Energy, and Veterans Affairs, and then Congress must reach an overall budget deal. But the House made clear its priorities for shifting the nation’s energy investments away from clean energy as it voted on more than 70 amendments. Although it didn’t go as far as President Donald Trump’s White House budget plan, which would have cut the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by 68 percent, the House was in sync with the administration’s plan for a dramatic retreat from spending on carbon-free technology for power and fuel. In its biggest departure from the Trump administration’s energy budget proposal, the House voted to preserve funding for fossil energy research and development at current levels. The White House had sought a 55 percent cut in the Office of Fossil Energy Research and Development. “Coal, natural gas and oil—fossil fuels—make up 81 percent of this nation’s energy consumption,” said Rep.

    "date": "2017-07-31T07:00:11-04:00",
    "content": "President Donald Trump marvels at his own velocity when he boasts about dismantling the Obama climate legacy. “I have been moving at record pace to cancel these regulations and to eliminate the barriers to domestic energy production, like never before,” he said at a recent White House event. But while Trump focuses on speed, his allies in Congress appear increasingly concerned about the durability of the president’s fossil fuel directives. In recent weeks, they have advanced a handful of legislative measures that echo and extend various presidential orders meant to boost coal, oil and gas production and set aside consideration of climate change. These moves may seem redundant, but they could provide bulletproof armor during future challenges to Trump’s agenda. “They are … covering their bases by trying to legislate the rolling back of these safeguards because the process to repeal, undo or rewrite a regulation is as lengthy as the public process that helped establish the standard in the first place,” explained Melinda Pierce, chief lobbyist for the Sierra Club. “And, of course, any attempt to roll back environmental or public health standards can and will be challenged in court.” “The Trump administration is attacking every environmental and health protection we have,” said Sara Jordan, legislative representative for the League of Conservation Voters. “If these legislative proposals get passed, it will make it that much harder for the next administration to restore environmental protections.” That’s why Congressional Republicans are racing to write his instructions into law. “We need to put the legislative stamp of approval on what the Trump administration is doing,” said Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) during a recent debate on the House floor. The House already has voted to fast-track Trump’s withdrawal of a clean water rule and to streamline future environmental reviews over cross-border pipelines like Keystone XL. Now, GOP members are pushing forward legislation to bolster Trump’s revival of federal coal leasing, and to bar government regulatory agencies from considering the future damages caused by greenhouse gas pollution. The courts have already started chipping away at the Trump administration’s edicts. A federal appeals court ruled July 3 that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cannot simply suspend an Obama-era rule on methane emissions from oil and gas facilities. And a federal judge ruled last month that the Army Corps of Engineers had moved too hastily to permit the Dakota Access pipeline project, without considering environmental justice impacts on the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Environmental groups, states, and tribes have planned or filed lawsuits over virtually every aspect of the Trump energy agenda. “We’re going to meet them in court, we’re going to sue them, and we’re going to prevail,” Mitchell Bernard, chief counsel for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said in a video the environmental group produced. But Congress could short-circuit that litigation strategy with measures like the provision passed by the House last week allowing withdrawal of Obama’s “Waters of the U.S.” rule without public notice, comment or any of the other requirements that apply to federal departments and agencies. The Trump administration already has begun rescinding the rule, which was written to protect wetlands from dredge and fill material and created new permitting and reporting requirements that the oil, gas and coal industry abhor. The rider that the GOP tucked into an $800 billion budget bill would hurry the repeal and reduce possibilities for legal challenge. “That doesn’t sound like America to me,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), calling it “a very slippery slope to government by fiat.” But after a mere 10-minute debate, the majority by voice vote flicked away a Democratic effort to remove the provision, which now could be folded into must-pass budget legislation for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. House members also aim to ease energy development long after the Trump presidency ends, even if voters elect a successor who wants to reinstate pro-climate policies. For example, the “Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act,” passed by the House on July 19, would ensure no future president acts to block an oil or gas pipeline or electric power project that crosses a U.S. border, as President Barack Obama did with Keystone XL. The bill would take away presidential permitting authority and put decisions in the hands of a small independent agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has the mission of ensuring reliable energy for consumers at reasonable rates. If enacted, the law “tips the scales in favor of massive controversial oil and gas pipeline and electric transmission projects,” said Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), voicing futile opposition on the House floor. All Republicans and 17 Democrats voted for the bill. Another bill would make it impossible for a future administration to declare a moratorium on federal coal leasing, as the Obama administration did in its final year. The pause provided time to conduct the first review in decades of coal royalty rates, especially in light of coal’s role in climate change. Under an order signed by Trump, his secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, lifted the moratorium soon after taking office. That move is being challenged in court by four states, environmental groups and a Native American tribe in Montana. But Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) introduced legislation that would require future administrations to seek Congressional permission before imposing any such moratorium—circumscribing the authority that the Interior Department has had under federal mining law since",

    "date": "2017-07-19T10:00:50-04:00",
    "content": "Global warming may be unleashing new sources of heat-trapping methane from layers of oil and gas that have been buried deep beneath Arctic permafrost for millennia. As the Earth’s frozen crust thaws, some of that gas appears to be finding new paths to the surface through permafrost that’s starting to resemble Swiss cheese in some areas, scientists said. In a study released today, the scientists used aerial sampling of the atmosphere to locate methane sources from permafrost along a 10,000 square-kilometer swath of the Mackenzie River Delta in northwestern Canada, an area known to have oil and gas desposits. Deeply thawed pockets of permafrost, the research suggests, are releasing 17 percent of all the methane measured in the region, even though the emissions hotspots only make up 1 percent of the surface area, the scientists found. In those areas, the peak concentrations of methane emissions were found to be 13 times higher than levels usually caused by bacterial decomposition—a well-known source of methane emissions from permafrost—which suggests the methane is likely also coming from geological sources, seeping up along faults and cracks in the permafrost, and from beneath lakes. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. The findings suggest that global warming will “increase emissions of geologic methane that is currently still trapped under thick, continuous permafrost, as new emission pathways open due to thawing permafrost,” the authors wrote in the journal Scientific Reports. Along with triggering bacterial decomposition in permafrost soils, global warming can also trigger stronger emissions of methane from fossil gas, contributing to the carbon-climate feedback loop, they concluded. “This is another methane source that has not been included so much in the models,” said the study’s lead author, Katrin Kohnert, a climate scientist at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany. “If, in other regions, the permafrost becomes discontinuous, more areas will contribute geologic methane,” she said. The findings are based on two years of detailed aerial atmospheric sampling above the Mackenzie River Delta. It was one of the first studies to look for sources of deep methane across such a large region. Previous site-specific studies in Alaska have looked at single sources of deep methane, including beneath lakes. A",

    "content": "Eight U.S. senators called for an investigation today after a federal climate scientist filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that he had been arbitrarily reassigned by the Trump administration in what he believed was retaliation for speaking out publicly about the dangers climate change poses to Alaska Native communities. The scientist, Joel Clement, had been working on climate adaptation in Alaska for the Department of Interior when he was moved to an obscure accounting position that deals with fossil fuel royalty payments. The senators, all members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked the deputy  in the Department of Interior to look into allegations that as many as 50 Senior Executive Service employees at the department have been arbitrarily reassigned. “We believe that any reassignment of highly trained, highly competent senior executives within the department from the positions in which they may best use their training and competence to accomplish the department’s mission and best serve the public interest to sinecures where their talents are wasted would constitute a serious act of mismanagement, a gross waste of public funds, and an abuse of authority,” the senators wrote. The Senior Executive Service was created to provide continuity in the management of public programs, with career experts in their subject areas serving under the political appointees. Under the law, agency heads can reassign senior executives, provided the changes are made “to best accomplish the agency’s mission.” “Any suggestion that the department is reassigning SES employees to force them to resign, to silence their voices, or to punish them for the conscientious performance of their public duties is extremely troubling and calls for the closest examination,” the senators wrote. No Republicans signed the letter. The letter came just days after Clement, formerly the director of the Office of Policy Analysis in the Interior Department, filed a formal complaint about his reassignment and published an op-ed in the Washington Post describing his experience. In an interview with InsideClimate News, Clement said he thought it was “fishy” when he was reassigned, and that those suspicions were quickly confirmed. “When [Interior Secretary Ryan] Zinke testified the next week that they were going to use reassignments to trim the workforce, then you could really smell a rat,” Clement said. The day after Clement spoke out, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) raised concerns about the reassignments at a Congressional hearing. “It’s a lot of confusion and, in my sense, a lot of undermining science,” she said. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also told E&E News that she planned to speak with Zinke about Clement’s case. Cantwell was joined in the request for an investigation by seven colleagues on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee: Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). They asked Interior Department Deputy  Mary Kendall to report back to them, as well as to Secretary Zinke and the appropriate committees in Congress.

    "date": "2017-07-18T04:36:01-04:00",
    "content": "This story was updated July 18 after the commission’s vote. South Miami just became Florida’s first city to require new homes to include rooftop solar installations, thanks to a teenage girl who helped write the ordinance. Now, despite facing opposition from a Washington, D.C.-based organization, she’s set on spreading the measure across the state. The ordinance received initial approval from South Miami’s city commission last week, and was approved on Tuesday by a vote of 4-1. But its origins date back more than a year, to when Delaney Reynolds, then a 16-year-old high school student from Miami-Dade County, read about a similar measure passed in San Francisco, the first major U.S. city to require rooftop solar for new construction. Reynolds wrote to the mayors of half a dozen cities in her area, urging them to draft similar ordinances. Philip Stoddard of South Miami was the first to respond. “Climate change is the biggest issue that my generation will ever face in our lifetime,” Reynolds said. “We’re going to be the ones who inherit this mess, and we’re going to be the ones to solve it as well.” Reynolds had already devoted years to raising awareness about climate change and sea level rise before starting her campaign for solar ordinances. She founded a nonprofit called The Sink or Swim Project, which highlights the climate challenges facing South Florida. Stoddard invited her to help write the ordinance for South Miami. Since they began, he said, he and colleagues have heard from officials in other cities, including St. Petersburg and Orlando, who are interested in replicating the work. The ordinance describes several climate threats the Miami area is facing, including its vulnerability to sea level rise and extreme temperatures. Tidal flooding has already forced the city to modify its sewer system, it says. It also notes the city’s",

    "date": "2017-07-14T23:28:57-04:00",
    "content": "During a blistering heat wave in the Southwest last month, American Airlines cancelled dozens of flights in Phoenix because certain planes in its fleet weren’t designed to operate at temperatures above 118 degrees. The cancellations made headlines. But as global warming stokes more heat waves, that scenario is likely to replay more frequently, creating hassles for air travelers and cutting into airline profits. A study published Thursday in the journal Climatic Change looked at 19 airports around the world and found that rising temperatures will make it harder for airplanes to take off. During especially hot periods, airplanes will likely have to reduce the amount of weight they can carry in order to get airborne. “Heat waves are going to become much more frequent and intense in the future,” said Radley Horton, a climatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and co-author of the report. “We’re already seeing planes unable to take off at full weight.” The situation will get especially troublesome at certain airports, including New York’s LaGuardia and Washington, D.C.’s Reagan National, which have shorter runways, and the Dubai International Airport, where temperatures regularly hover above 110 degrees. “As temperatures go up, air density goes down. There’s effectively less mass passing over the wing,” Horton explained. “With less mass, you need more speed to get the necessary lift, so if you have shorter runways, you can’t get the necessary speed.” At Reagan National and LaGuardia, there’s simply no room to extend runways, so planes traveling to and from those airports will have to shed weight instead. Ethan Coffel, a Columbia University doctoral student and co-author of the report, said the costs to the airlines will be “non-trivial.” Coffel and Horton estimate that, if greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, some airplanes will have to offload up to 4 percent of the weight they are carrying on the hottest days. On a typical flight, that might mean removing a dozen or so passengers. The study, the authors believe, is the first to look at the impact of climate change on takeoffs. Much of the aviation-focused research done so far has explored how aviation affects global warming, rather than the other way around. (About 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from aviation, and this is increasing.) One study published in May found that global warming may make turbulence worse. The new study notes that global temperatures have already risen 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, with most of the rise occurring since",

The real problem here is this administration’s obsession with selling out more of our public lands to the oil and gas industry at the expense of the American people,” Culver said.

So far, only a few states have laws demanding that utilities meet targets for energy storage—including California, Oregon, Massachusetts and Nevada—and their targets vary. Massachusetts drew criticism today when it announced its first targets, which energy experts considered well below what will be needed. New York’s legislature has now passed a bill that would join those states by asking its Public Service Commission to set targets for energy storage in New York by as early as January of next year. “Anyone in the business knows storage is critical to making intermittent energy a reality. Because of this, New York has got to take a leadership role,” said Westchester Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, who co-sponsored the bill. She said she was confident that Gov. Andrew Cuomo would sign it.

    "title": "BMW Tests Electric Cars as Power Grid Stabilizers",
    "date": "2017-06-28T09:34:56-04:00",
    "content": "In an important real-world test of whether electric vehicles could play a bigger role in backing up the green power grid of the future, a group of San Francisco-area drivers showed that they were willing and even eager to adjust their charging times for the right financial incentives. The small but sophisticated pilot test that took place over 18 months. During that time, BMW asked owners of its electric cars if they would be willing to delay recharging them by an hour on the company’s cue. An app notified the owners when a delay was coming, and they could opt out if they needed to charge at that time. “Eighteen months later, I can unequivocally state that participation was transparent, hassle-free and mind-numbingly dull to the point that I mostly forgot about it,” one participant, John Higham, wrote in a first person account of his experience for Inside EVs. The trial led BMW and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the utility for Northern California, to suggest that if electric vehicles become as popular as expected, electric vehicle demand management could become a powerful tool for supporting grid flexibility. “The overall lesson is we can use resources likes electric vehicles to help support the grid during times of peak use,” said Ari Vanrenen, a spokesman for PG&E. Renewable energy experts have long held the theory that electric vehicles will play a momentous role in helping the electric grid be more flexible. EVs could be deployed to buffer uneven power generation of wind and solar. Owners might, for example, wait to charge their cars until the height of the day, when solar is most plentiful and cheapest. Or, they might delay their charging during peak hours in the early evening, when the grid is under the most stress. As of now, customer sensitivity to prices is still an unknown quantity. While the BMW-PG&E partnership tested only whether customers would agree to delay their demand by an hour if given a financial incentive, it offered some concrete evidence that influencing customer behavior is possible. For the test, PG&E asked BMW to build a system that could remove 100 kilowatts of demand from the grid on short notice. PG&E could make the call at a random time. Of particular interest to the utility was whether demand could eventually be decreased during peak load hours of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., when solar power is waning for the day and demand on the grid ramps up. BMW’s app would signal to customers that a one-hour delay was coming. If the car was connected to a charging station at that time, BMW could trigger the charging delay through software in the vehicle. Participants were paid $1,000 up front to participate in the study and $540 more depending on how many times their vehicle participated in the request for a one-hour delay. If BMW could not meet the power reduction goal through delaying customer charging, it was encouraged to supply the necessary charging through its own battery storage center. Throughout the 18-month test period, which ended in December",

    "date": "2017-06-28T22:41:11-04:00",
    "content": "The Republican-led House Armed Services Committee took a quietly momentous step Wednesday by passing an amendment requesting a Defense Department report on the security risks posed by climate change. The importance lies less in the details of the measure—an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act—than in the political statement from a body that only one year ago tried to block the military from spending money to prepare for climate change. “The truth is that the department can study this on their own, as they have a wide berth when it comes to assessing threats to national security,” said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the amendment’s sponsor. “But this amendment shows that Congress has the department’s back. It signals that we are not naive to the dangers of climate change to our defense strategy.” The amendment asks the Defense Department to issue a report within a year identifying the 10 military sites most vulnerable to the many manifestations of climate change, and what steps are needed to protect them. It also asks for a discussion of how climate change will affect top commanders of fielded forces who may have to deal with instability brought on by a climate crisis. The military has conducted extensive studies on the risks and impacts of climate change to its operations for more than a decade and has issued several significant reports. Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general and former head of U.S. Central Command, has repeatedly spoken about how climate change can drive instability and threaten national security, most recently in written testimony he provided to a Senate panel. For years, Republicans in the House passed amendments to try to block this work, but the Senate never approved the measures. Langevin and other supporters weren’t expecting to gain Republican votes, but after a series of Democrats spoke in favor of the amendment, Rep. Rob Bishop, a Republican from Utah, chimed in. “Whether the first four pages are accurate or not,” he said, referring to a series of quotes by Mattis and others and a list of projected climate impacts, “there’s nothing dangerous about talking about it. This asks for a report. I’ll support the idea of having a report.” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) spoke against the measure, but several of her Republican colleagues joined Bishop, and the measure passed on a voice vote. The committee had already included other language in the bill supporting the department’s work on climate change and requiring a separate, narrower report on the flooding from rising seas at military installations. The apparent change of sentiment is a surprising break from how House Republicans voted on the issue in the past, said Andrew Holland, senior fellow for energy and climate at the American Security Project, a nonpartisan research organization. “I think that’s a pretty remarkable turnaround in one year, and I think it speaks to the fact that now that Republicans are fully in power they have to responsibly plan and prepare for reality.” Francesco Femia, president of the Center for Climate and Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said the committee is sending a message to the White House. “It’s the House, including Republicans in the House, saying to the administration: This is an issue we think is serious. You should take it seriously too.” The committee was still marking up the bill Wednesday evening. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-06-16T21:42:09-04:00",
    "content": "A judge on Friday approved a request by the New York Attorney General’s office to grill several ExxonMobil employees as part of its widening probe into whether the oil giant misled investors about its risks from climate change. Justice Barry R. Ostrager refused a request by Exxon to block two of the depositions at a hearing in which he ordered the two sides to meet outside of court to hash out their differences over New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s demand for more documents. The contentious hearing did little to resolve the ongoing dispute between Exxon and the attorney general’s office, which is investigating whether the company committed financial fraud involving what it told investors about climate change risk. Ostrager declined to rule on whether Exxon would have to produce additional documents that were subpoenaed Schneiderman in May. Exxon had asked the judge to throw out the requests. Instead, Ostrager told Exxon and the attorney general’s office they should work together outside of court to agree on specific questions for the company to answer about the details of its climate accounting. Those questions, together with the depositions, would provide a quicker resolution to the case, he said. “If you had done that on day one,” he told state lawyers, “you’d be 1,000 yards ahead of where you are today.” The judge did hand Schneiderman one victory. Ostrager ordered Exxon to provide testimony of an employee of its Canadian affiliate, Imperial Oil. The employee had been involved in evaluating the future costs of potential climate regulations for a project in the tar sands, and Exxon apparently told him not to apply the estimates contained in the company’s corporate directives, but instead to use the much lower levels of Alberta’s provincial carbon tax, according to documents filed by the attorney general. That decision was a key piece of evidence Schneiderman filed with the court earlier this month to argue that Exxon’s climate accounting “may be a sham.” Exxon had resisted making the employee available, arguing it doesn’t control its Canadian affiliate. It also tried to block the deposition of one of the company’s in-house lawyers, though it had agreed to offer several other employees as witnesses, including the executive who oversees the company’s long-term assessment of global energy demand. At the heart of the current dispute is whether Exxon has supplied all the documents required under a subpoena Schneiderman issued in",

    "title": "Congress to Pruitt: We’re Not Cutting EPA Budget to Trump’s Levels",
    "date": "2017-06-15T20:41:44-04:00",
    "content": "Members of the congressional committee responsible for the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget—Republican and Democrat alike—made clear Thursday they have no intention of approving the White House’s proposal to slash the agency’s spending. In a hearing, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt defended the Trump administration’s budget plan for the first time on Capitol Hill, insisting that the agency he leads could fulfill its mission under a plan that cuts its budget more than any other federal agency’s. On climate change, the committee members divided along party lines on whether they supported the Trump administration’s decision to exit the Paris accord. Pruitt, who was a chief proponent of the move, claimed that President Donald Trump would “continue engagement” on the subject. But most of the hearing focused on other issues, with members of both parties driving home the point that Congress will not pass a budget that cuts the EPA’s funding by 31 percent and eliminates nearly 50 of the agency’s programs. “You are going to be the first EPA administrator who has come before this committee in many years who actually gets more than he asks for,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). That theme was echoed by several of his colleagues on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Like other committee members, Cole noted the need for the EPA’s role in addressing the environmental issues that his own constituents face. For Cole, the issue was large proposed cuts in state and tribal assistance and in water pollution control. Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio) balked at the idea of cutting the Great Lakes Initiative. To avoid forcing either Pruitt or Trump to bear the brunt of his criticism, he began to refer to the budget by the name of Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, a former congressman. “Simply put, the Mulvaney budget appears to largely remove the federal government as a partner in all of our efforts to manage and to Great Lakes,” Joyce said. The subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), criticized the White House plan to reduce by 83 percent Diesel Emission Reduction grants, which he said are essential to improving his state’s air quality. “You have a tough job here today,” Calvert said to Pruitt. He noted that the EPA, in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s plan to shift $54 billion from domestic to military spending, would see its budget cut $2.4 billion under the proposal. Calvert said that although he supported additional funding for the military, taking the entire amount out of non-defense spending in one fiscal year was “an untenable proposition.” “The budget proposes to significantly reduce, or terminate, programs that are vitally important to each member on this subcommittee,” Calvert said. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) criticized the decision to exit the Paris accord, but true to the theme of the day, brought it back to her own constituents. “Climate change to us is very real. It’s not an environmental platitude,” she said. Maine lobstermen, she said, “look at me with fear in their eyes because we are watching the migration of lobsters, as we’ve seen the disappearance of shrimping. This is important to their identity; it’s important economically. I can’t go home to people and say this isn’t happening. I can’t go home and say ocean acidification isn’t happening.” Referring to Pruitt’s home state and his well-document close relationship with its biggest industry, Pingree said, “I know it’s different in Oklahoma, where you have the fossil fuel industry in your backyard,” she said. “But I represent a state in the tailpipe of the fossil fuel industry.” Pruitt noted that Trump, in his speech announcing the U.S. exit from the Paris climate agreement, said he hoped to renegotiate it—a notion that other world leaders have rejected. “He said he wanted to continue engagement on this issue,” Pruitt said. Pruitt said he had begun that process at last week’s meeting of G7 environmental ministers (which ended with Pruitt leaving after only a few hours and the U.S. not signing on to the group’s statements on climate change). “I began the process of bilateral discussions with respect to continued U.S. leadership on CO2,” Pruitt said. In defense of the agency’s plan to repeal the Obama administration’s most important climate change regulation, the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt said that Congress had not given the EPA a mandate to regulate carbon dioxide from stationary sources—power plants. (That assertion ignores court rulings that have upheld the Obama-era EPA’s interpretation that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act.) The rules, stayed by the Supreme Court, are under litigation; the agency has already started to rework them. Pruitt spent most of the hearing promising to work with members of Congress on the concerns they raised—about endocrine disrupting chemicals, Puget Sound pollution, the Great Lakes, Superfund sites, and more—and on how the EPA could continue to meet the objectives of the programs that the White House was proposing to cut. “I believe we can fulfill the mission of our agency with a trim budget,” Pruitt said. Sierra Club spokesman Adam Beitman summed up the hearing in a sardonic Tweet: “Congress to Pruitt: How will you protect X while cutting funding for it? @EPAScottPruitt: It’s so important to protect X, thank you.” But Cole, Pruitt’s fellow Oklahoman, who agrees with him that Trump was right to leave the Paris agreement, said he should not expect Congress to accept the dramatic cuts to the EPA that the White House envisions. “The final decision rests here,” Cole said. “The Constitution’s pretty clear on that. It’s important that we have the president’s priorities, but at the end of the day, Congress will make the decision.” As the two-hour hearing closed, Calvert interrupted Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) when he began pressing Pruitt on specific programs tagged for elimination, like the Energy Star efficiency program, Natural Gas Star voluntary program for methane reduction, and others Kilmer said would help address “the generational burden of climate change.” “We’re going to work with you on those,” Calvert told Kilmer. Then, looking at Pruitt but speaking to his Democratic colleague, the chairman said, “He has to defend his budget. But we’re going to work with you.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

    "date": "2017-05-31T17:17:40-04:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil shareholders voted Wednesday to require the world’s largest oil and gas company to report on the impacts of climate change to its business—defying management, and marking a milestone in a 28-year effort by activist investors. Sixty-two percent of shareholders voted for Exxon to begin producing an annual report that explains how the company will be affected by global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement. The analysis should address the financial risks the company faces as nations slash fossil fuel use in an effort to prevent worldwide temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. Last year, 38 percent of Exxon shareholders supported essentially the same measure, which at the time was a record. The vote at Exxon shows the rapid erosion of support for the company’s defiant stance on climate disclosure, and it caps a shareholder meeting season that saw unprecedented support for greater corporate disclosure on climate change. In recent weeks, shareholders voted in favor of climate risk analysis at two other major energy companies, Occidental Petroleum and PPL, Pennsylvania’s largest utility. Climate-related shareholder resolutions also garnered record support at other big U.S. utilities that rely on fossil fuels: Dominion Resources (47.8%), Duke Energy (46.4%) and DTE Energy (45%). In a week when President Donald Trump is expected to either back out of the Paris accord or scale down the U.S. commitment to cut carbon emissions, the vote at Exxon shows that momentum for action on climate is growing without White House leadership. Mainstream investment firms are asking harder questions of companies as scientific evidence of the need for deep decarbonization of the global economy mounts. Investigations, first by InsideClimate News and then by the Columbia University School of Journalism and the Los Angeles Times, also showed that Exxon long knew of the risks posed by climate change, yet its leaders avoided disclosing those risks to the public and instead sowed doubt about the science. Attorneys general for New York and Massachusetts are now leading an investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders in violation of securities laws. The oil industry and its allies are mounting a defense, with prominent industry analyst Daniel Yergin, the powerhouse lobby of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others opposing calls for climate change scenarios to be integrated into corporate financial disclosure. They say that securities law on disclosure is meant to inform investors of potential returns, not to implement social policy. But institutional investors argue that climate risk is a long-term financial risk that should be integrated into financial reporting. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm, with $5.1 trillion in assets under management, and several major global investors—including State Street, Aviva, and Legal & General—have signaled that they want more transparency on climate change risk. BlackRock’s first vote against corporate management on climate came this year against Occidental, where it was the largest institutional investor. “I think we are witnessing a truly historic shift in shareholder support for these resolutions,” said Andrew Logan, director of the oil and gas program at Ceres, a nonprofit that works with institutional investors on sustainability issues. “It’s a sign that the world is getting ahead of the oil industry. When you have very conservative institutions like BlackRock and Vanguard taking these positions, you know the issue has changed in some fundamental way.” “Carbon risk is now understood to be a financial fundamental,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a corporate social responsibility and shareholder advocacy organization that supported the Exxon resolution.

    "date": "2017-05-26T20:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Sign up to receive our latest reporting on climate change, energy and environmental justice, sent directly to your inbox. Subscribe here. Cutting-edge labs have been making steady progress for at least a decade on a little-known technology that promises to generate much cleaner and cheaper electricity, with gains for solar, nuclear and fossil fuels alike. The technology, rarely mentioned outside the world of advanced energy R&D, is called “supercritical carbon dioxide,” or SCO2. It may be the world’s most obscure silver bullet, but it promises the kind of quantum leap so desperately sought for steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as countries try to deal with climate change. According to two articles published this week by Science magazine, its commercial development could be fast approaching. One, by scientists involved in this research, describes dramatic efficiency gains expected in a range of power-plant designs that would be considerably smaller and cheaper to build than today’s. The second, a news article by a staff reporter, details how entrepreneurs are aiming to bring the technology to the grid through a novel low-emissions natural gas plant in Texas. Scientists involved in the work describe it as profoundly exciting—if not yet a sure thing. But despite the enthusiasm, President Donald Trump’s budget proposal released this week threatens to choke it off. A key program called STEP, for Supercritical Transformational Electric Power, is among those facing the ax in the Energy Department’s proposed budget. Just last year, the Obama administration said STEP “has the potential to revolutionize electric power generation.” Supercritical CO2 could go from a poster child for the benefits of federally supported energy research to a case study in opportunity lost. The past decade’s work, scattered among national labs, schools and private companies, has been financed without much fanfare, a few million dollars at a time, by the Department of Energy. What fired up this interest was partly supercritical CO2’s “all-of-the-above” factor—its broad utility for nuclear, fossil, solar, biomass and geothermal operations turning heat into electricity. It offers to do all this much more efficiently, and at much lower cost, than is now possible. Put simply, supercritical CO2 works by using carbon dioxide to spin turbines in power plants. The first step is to compress and heat the gas far beyond normal, turning it into a sort of bottled genie with powers that transcend those of conventional steam. It’s called “supercritical” because the pressures and temperatures are raised so high that the carbon dioxide behaves like a fluid in some ways, and like a gas in others. That produces an ideal state that works with unusual force and bleeds off far less energy, but it can be a bit finicky. A specialized turbine using supercritical CO2 can be a lot smaller but much more powerful than an ordinary steam plant. It demands, however, high performance metals, and finely calibrated instruments that have to be devised and tested. The Energy Department’s labs and contractors have been assiduously working on these nuts and bolts for years. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Gary Rochau, a manager for advanced nuclear concepts at Sandia National Laboratories, where much of the work is centered, said in an interview that the government recently signed cooperative research deals aimed at solving more of the key obstacles. In a year and a half, he expects to see a 1 megawatt microgrid generator ready for qualifying trials that would be small enough to mount on a flatbed truck—an efficient replacement for a big diesel generator. After another year, it might be scaled up to 6 megawatts. By",

The new figures bolstered a theme that has been sounded repeatedly by the OECD, the research and policy organization that represents developed nations. “There is no economic excuse for not acting on climate change, and the urgency to act is high,” Gurría said.

    "date": "2017-05-17T05:00:11-04:00",
    "content": "Lawmakers are calling on Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to hand over information about a key agency appointee, citing her record as an energy industry lobbyist as recently as the first quarter of this year. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) sent a letter to Pruitt on Tuesday, challenging his appointment of Elizabeth “Tate” Bennett as deputy associate administrator of EPA’s Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations. In that role, Bennett is the agency’s primary point person and liaison with Congress and state governments. The senators cited President Donald Trump’s executive order on ethics, writing: “Because of her activities as a registered federal lobbyist she cannot work on legislation, communicate with Congress, or coordinate and monitor regional, state and local responses to a wide-range of major issues faced by EPA.” Bennett worked for two years as a lobbyist for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which represents more than 900 customer-owned rural utilities. The association, whose members have been historically reliant on coal, has pushed heavily against emissions-cutting regulations, including the Clean Power Plan. The senators say that Bennett’s appointment violates Trump’s executive order on ethics, which says appointees can’t “participate in the specific issue area” for which they lobbied in the two years prior to their appointment. Trump issued the order during his second week in office, following up on his oft-repeated campaign pledge to “drain the swamp.” Previous presidents had similar ethics orders. The EPA and Bennett’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter points out that the association spent $5.3 million on lobbying during Bennett’s tenure, and that she “specifically lobbied on a broad set of EPA matters, including EPA’s Clean Power Plan and New Source Performance Standard, Clean Water Rule, ozone standard, EPA enforcement, pesticides bills, budget resolutions, and appropriations bills.” Prior to her position at the rural utilities association, Bennett was an energy and agriculture aid to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The appointment is the latest in a series of lobbying-related ethics problems facing Trump appointees. Critics of Pruitt have questioned his deep ties to fossil fuel companies, including his leadership in the Koch brothers-funded Rule of Law Defense Fund, which lobbied heavily against environmental regulations. Late last month, the director of the Office of Government Ethics challenged the Trump administration’s granting of waivers that exempt appointees from the president’s ethics pledge.

    "content": "The renewable energy industry is asking Energy Secretary Rick Perry to open up a major agency review to public scrutiny, saying the review is based on the faulty idea that renewable energy undermines the reliability of the electrical grid. In a letter Tuesday, four renewable energy trade groups said they were disappointed that the Department of Energy had closed its review to input from “the industry, grid operators, state regulators, and other key stakeholders.” The groups—Advanced Energy Economy, American Council on Renewable Energy, American Wind Energy Association and Solar Energy Industries Association—also submitted their own arguments that renewable energy is making the American power supply more reliable, not less. In April, Perry ordered the DOE to conduct a 60-day review of grid reliability, suggesting in his memo that renewable energy was to blame for an “erosion of critical baseload resources.” “This has resulted in part from regulatory burdens introduced by previous administrations that were designed to decrease coal-fired power generation,” Perry wrote in the April 14 memo. “Such policies have destroyed jobs and economic growth, and they threaten to undercut the performance of the grid well into the future.” The industry groups wrote to Perry on Tuesday that they are “concerned that the scope of the report appears to be based on a faulty premise—a premise contrary to the experience in your home state of Texas—that renewable generation is responsible for the retirement of coal and nuclear generation resources, and that the loss of those resources will lead to declining reliability of the grid.” They said that, because the agency was not soliciting public comment on the review, they were submitting their own report for the agency to consider. In that report, they write, “While there is a place for all resources, including baseload, in our current energy mix, these concerns stem from a misunderstanding of how the grid works today.” The report argues that renewables, along with a more flexible and diverse energy system, are making the electric power system more reliable, not less.

    "date": "2017-05-17T05:40:41-04:00",
    "content": "Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday announced an ambitious plan to cut carbon pollution from the state’s power plants, taking a stand against the Trump administration’s continued efforts to dismantle carbon-cutting regulations. McAuliffe issued an executive order directing state environmental regulators to begin creating a market-based carbon-trading program. The mandatory cap-and-trade program would become the third in the country, after California’s statewide carbon compliance market and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program consisting of nine states in the northeast. The Virginia program would likely be linked to either of these trading programs. “The threat of climate change is real, and we have a shared responsibility to confront it,” McAuliffe said. “Once approved, this regulation will reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the Commonwealth’s power plants and give rise to the next generation of energy jobs,” he said. “As the federal government abdicates its role on this important issue, it is critical for states to fill the void.” The order calls for state regulators to create a legal framework for emissions trading. A proposed rule with details of the plan is expected this December, shortly before McAuliffe’s term ends, and a rulemaking process will follow. “As with administrative rulemaking, he has the authority to regulate carbon, but he can’t pre-dictate what the final results are going to be,” explained Walton Shepherd, a staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The standard he’d like to shoot for is to trade in existing markets, so presumably the stringency would have to be at or above those states in order to participate.” Last week, the state’s attorney general issued an official opinion confirming that the State Air Pollution Control Board has the authority to regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants. At a press conference Tuesday morning in Alexandria, McAuliffe, a Democrat, said he supported a national program to cut carbon emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, President Barack Obama’s signature effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet the targets of the Paris climate pledge. The plan, which was challenged by the power industry and 24 states, is currently under a stay from the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration is continuing its attempts to reverse it. “Unfortunately, the news out of this White House is alarming,” McAuliffe said, according to the Associated Press. “The citizens of our commonwealth want and expect us to confront this issue.” Virginia Republicans, who control both houses of the legislature, are already hinting at possible legal action. “The governor is ignoring the legislative process by putting forward broadly expansive environmental regulations—a policy he never proposed to the General Assembly,” Speaker of the House William J. Howell said in an emailed statement. “We are carefully reviewing today’s announcement and will take every action necessary to ensure that the voices of Virginia’s citizens are heard, and that major policy changes are adopted through the legislative process.” Environmental groups, meanwhile, applauded the announcement. “This is a perfect example of how states and local governments can ensure our nation takes climate action even as Donald Trump buries his head in the sand while the seas are rising,” Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said in a statement. Some urged more aggressive action. “The governor can further cement a positive legacy on climate change by finally dropping his support for offshore oil drilling in Virginia and—most importantly—drop his support for two massive proposed pipelines to transport fracked gas from West Virginia to Virginia,” said the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. Tuesday’s executive order follows on another that called for a series of meetings where regulators and the industry weighed in on possible strategies the state could adopt to cut its emissions. Dominion Resources, the state’s biggest utility and a rare supporter of the Clean Power Plan, was among them. “Dominion Energy has been preparing for carbon regulation for some time now and appreciates being a part of the stakeholder engagement process,” spokesman David Botkins said in an emailed statement, adding, “It still looks like the regulatory uncertainty around carbon continues.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Could FOIA Force Trump Administration to Restore Missing Climate Data?",
    "date": "2017-05-09T18:06:05-04:00",
    "content": "As Donald Trump‘s administration continues to strip climate change information from federal websites, two advocacy groups and a conservation biologist are using a novel technique to try to force the government to republish the pages. A new provision in open records law, added by Congress last year, requires agencies to publish electronically any information that is requested at least three times through the federal Freedom of Information Act, so long as that information is not otherwise exempt from disclosure. Last week, the advocacy groups and the biologist submitted identical requests for climate change information, hoping to trigger that provision, and they just might succeed. “The law is pretty explicit,” said Aaron Mackey, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes transparency. “The law just says, if you get three, then you have to affirmatively disclose it. This should work.” The effort by the Center for Biological Diversity, the Center for Media and Democracy, and Stuart Pimm, a professor at Duke University, is the latest in a broad campaign by scientists and advocates to cache federal data about climate change and other topics that they fear may be deleted by the Trump administration. Volunteers have gathered for massive “data rescue” events to download information. Advocates have sued. Now, the groups are trying to use the Freedom of Information Act and the new provision to get the government, starting with the Interior Department, to re-post its old climate change webpages. Last month, the Department of Interior quietly edited its climate change page, removing an extensive discussion of the effects of global warming and the department’s work on the issue and replacing it with two short paragraphs that do not discuss any details of the impacts of climate change. Instead, it provided links to its bureau’s climate change pages, including the page of the Bureau of Land Management, which no longer exists, and others that have been edited. “The changes basically remove any information about the causes of climate change, most notably mankind’s contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,” said Amy Atwood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s just absurd.” Paul Ross, a spokesman for the Interior Department, said in a statement emailed to InsideClimate News that “the Department’s website has been updated periodically over the past few months to include additional priorities of the Department under new leadership.” He declined to address the public records requests. The department has 20 business days to reply to the requests. Atwood said her group would appeal if the requests are denied. The new requirement in the open records law was an attempt to codify what has long been considered best practice, Mackey said. The overarching goal of the Freedom of Information Act, or , is to make government more transparent, so it encourages agencies to publish information that is frequently requested or may be of broad interest, such as administrative decisions. Many agencies, including the Interior Department, have online “reading rooms” where they make such documents available. Mackey said that while the spirit of the law implies that agencies should publish information that’s requested three times in an easily accessible area, like an online reading room, it contains no explicit direction beyond requiring them to make it “available for public inspection in an electronic format.” After the EPA removed its climate change page, it published an archived version following a series of  requests. But it also removed links that would have made that archived page easy to find from the EPA’s homepage. Atwood said the groups would use the same  tactics to retrieve the information if the EPA deletes the archived page, or if the EPA or any other agency removes similar information. This isn’t the first time the groups have attempted to use the  provision. In March, they submitted requests to eight federal agencies seeking hundreds of environmental data sets out of concern that the Trump administration would remove them from public view. Atwood said they’ve gotten a range of responses so far. The Department of Agriculture has been working with them to try to identify and publish the data, she said, while others have simply rejected their requests or claimed—sometimes erroneously, according to Atwood—that the data was already published. The group is currently preparing to appeal those denied requests, and ultimately will go to court if the appeals fail. The Center for Biological Diversity has also used more conventional  requests to try to pry loose documents from the Trump administration, including records regarding whether leaders at several agencies directed their staffs to stop using the term “climate change.” Last week, the group sued the EPA in attempt to compel it to release emails and a schedule for its administrator, Scott Pruitt, after the agency denied a request seeking those records. Atwood said she expects to file an average of one lawsuit each week as the group’s  requests are denied. “We’re really in a position to be able to pursue information from the Trump administration,” Atwood said, “and we’re doing it at every turn.

    "date": "2017-05-10T14:08:48-04:00",
    "content": "The Senate on Wednesday rejected a bid to overturn an Obama-era rule that limits climate-warming methane leaks from oil and gas operations on public lands, but the industry, along with its allies in Congress, says it will continue challenging the rule. The surprise 49-51 vote handed a defeat to the industry, which has pushed Congress to undo the rule under the Congressional Review Act, a little-used law that allows lawmakers to kill rules with a simple majority vote. The rule, issued by the Department of the Interior at the end of the Obama administration, limits venting and flaring of methane from natural gas and oil drilling operations, a restriction that officials estimated would prevent 180,000 tons of methane from leaking into the atmosphere every year. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a short-lived climate pollutant with over 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Cutting methane emissions was a key element of Obama’s plan for meeting the U.S. commitment under the Paris climate agreement, and many experts view methane cuts as an especially efficient way to reduce emissions in the short term. Proponents of the rule also point out that the methane that escapes during the flaring and venting process could power more than 6 million homes. “The rule is so basic. All it’s asking for is for oil and gas companies to capture their methane waste, which is now going up into the atmosphere as carbon pollution, and really potent carbon pollution at that, and put it back into their pipes and, potentially, back into the market,” said Lena Moffitt, who directs the Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuel campaign. “It’s just asking them to plug their leaks.” The oil and gas industries, emboldened by the Donald Trump administration and backed by conservative groups, said the rule duplicated existing state rules and would lead to higher energy costs, job losses and less energy production on public lands. On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute made a final appeal to lawmakers to vote for the resolution, sending a letter that called the rule “flawed.” The House of Representatives passed a resolution to overturn the rule in February. Going into the vote Wednesday morning, Republican proponents believed they had the required 51 votes to overturn the rule. But a trio of Republican senators—Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona—voted against the measure. “This vote demonstrates that the oil and gas industries, and its allies in the Trump administration, simply misread the mood of the public,” said Mark Brownstein, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. “The difference was John McCain. … He didn’t say how he was going to vote, so people assumed he was going to go along with the herd.” Environmental groups said it was possible that the resolution to kill the methane rule could come up for a vote again, but it was unlikely, given McCain’s opposition. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress has to act on any resolution to repeal a rule within 60 Congressional working days. The final deadline would be Friday, by most estimates. In a statement issued Wednesday, McCain said: “While I am concerned that the BLM [Bureau of Land Management] rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is ‘similar,’ according to the plain reading of the Congressional Review Act. I believe that the public interest is best served if the Interior Department issues a new rule to revise and improve the BLM methane rule.” The industry said it plans to pursue lawsuits challenging the Interior Department’s authority to regulate air quality. “We’ll also be working closely with the Department of the Interior on reviewing and rescinding this rule,” said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance. “BLM has the authority to regulate waste, but that’s not what it did in this rule. It imposed air quality controls that read almost verbatim from EPA rules.” Any potential rulemaking, though, would have to undergo a rigorous public process. “It’s really encouraging to see that when communities and constituents band together, they can defeat even the most well-funded foes,” Moffitt said, referring to the lobbying push by the oil and gas industry. “They’ve been emboldened. They have a friend in the White House. But even with all that, this victory shows they can’t get their way all the time.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-05-01T19:58:54-04:00",
    "content": "President Donald Trump has a notorious for appetite for cable news, and this week, a bipartisan group hopes to catch his attention when it airs the first in a series of advertisements calling for action on climate change. The ads are part of a nascent effort to sway conservative and moderate voters at a time when the Trump administration is moving to loosen environmental protections. Earlier this year, a group of prominent Republicans made a splash by proposing a carbon tax, which would tax carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and send the revenues back to individuals and families, in exchange for the repeal of regulations on industry. This time, it is the bipartisan Partnership for Responsible Growth—also an advocate of a carbon tax—led by George Frampton, a longtime conservationist and lawyer who was a key environmental aide in the Clinton administration. The ads don’t explicitly talk about a carbon tax, opting instead for the vague phrase: “free market solution to climate change.” “We wanted to run these ads to combat the deluge of fossil fuel advertising in [Washington] D.C.,” Frampton said in a statement. “It matters what people see every day, and policymakers are surrounded with the message that we can continue with business as usual. That’s simply false, and it’s dangerous.” The first ad, which will air for a week on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, begins with a shot of a man in a dentist’s chair, and a narrator saying, “if 97 percent of all dentists told you a tooth couldn’t be saved, you’d pull that tooth.” It then runs through a series of comparisons to drive home the scientific consensus on climate change and invites viewers to go to the website pricecarbon.org, where the group describes its carbon tax message. So far, Republicans in Congress have been reticent to even talk about a carbon tax, even though many economists and business leaders support the idea. There has been no sign that Trump or his economic advisers are considering it as part of their broad proposals to rewrite the tax code. Instead, the Trump administration’s energy and environment policies promote unrestricted development of fossil fuels and work to dismantle Barack Obama’s entire Climate Action Plan. Many of Trump’s appointees have publicly questioned the mainstream consensus that climate change is an urgent problem, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has denied that carbon dioxide is the primary cause of warming. But there are signs that some Republicans are worried the party line is out of touch with many voters. “A lot of the Republican activists get it,” said Peter Bryn, who is in charge of working with conservatives for the Citizens Climate Lobby, a grassroots advocacy group that favors a carbon tax. “Climate change may not be at the top of their priority list, but they understand the issue,” he said during a conference call publicizing the ads. In March, a group of 17 House Republicans introduced a resolution acknowledging the science on climate change and calling for some kind of action. But the resolution offered no specific approach beyond “working constructively” on an “economically viable, and broadly supported” solution. In an interview with the Intercept last week, conservative activist Jerry Taylor said there are between 40 and 50 Republicans in the House and 10 and 12 in the Senate who do not agree with the GOP’s position on climate change. “They’re all looking for a way out of the denialist penitentiary they’ve been put into by the Tea Party,” he told the Intercept. Taylor, who used to reject the science behind climate change as a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, now works to promote conservative action on warming. On the call publicizing the ads, Taylor said he hopes they will help lay a foundation for a conversation based on the science rather than spin. The Partnership for Responsible Growth has prepared four more ads and hopes to run them year round in the Washington, D.C., area, with the second appearing next week.

For decades, the U.S. Forest Service has battled fires by extinguishing them or by reducing dry wood that acts as fuel. But the report published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concludes that because climate change is stoking bigger fires and development is placing more people in fire-prone areas, that approach has become inadequate. “We’re entering a new era of wildfires and our old tools are not going to carry us through,” said Tania Schoennagel, a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, who co-authored the report. “We’re not suggesting we stop suppressing fires, but we can’t continue to suppress fires and still remain safe.

    "date": "2017-04-12T16:00:20-04:00",
    "content": "The federal program overseeing climate change research has won an important endorsement from the authoritative National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine just as it faces the threat of budget cuts under the Donald Trump administration. An expert National Academies review panel issued a ringing endorsement of the work of the United States Global Change Research Program, calling the interagency program’s recent draft overview of the science “impressive, timely and generally well-written.” That draft was issued in the closing days of the Obama Administration, and was intended both as an up-to-date benchmark for the scientific consensus and to help set future research priorities. The reviewers said they were “impressed with the breadth, accuracy and rigor of the draft.” If anything, the National Academies panel urged the USGCRP to emphasize the urgency of bringing carbon dioxide emissions rapidly to zero. Instead, the Trump administration is signaling that it would rather bring climate research itself to zero, at least at the Environmental Protection Agency, a key participant in the USGCRP. Trump’s draft budget for the EPA called for eliminating its work for the interagency research program. The National Academies’ conclusions, like those in the draft it reviewed, describe the broadly accepted scientific reasoning to support urgent climate action. It called some of the evidence “new and significant,” including record temperatures, accelerated Arctic melting, better attribution of extreme weather events to human causes and a worsening outlook for rising seas. The 119-page National Academies review was written by 11 experts, mostly working in academia. They offered scores of nitty-gritty recommendations for making the report more comprehensive—and more comprehensible. “As with any report written by a committee, an editing pass will improve consistency and readability,” said the reviewers. But their key insight was the need to put the big picture in a nutshell in Chapter 14. That is where the USGCRP describes the implications of the Paris climate agreement and the path toward limiting the damages of global warming. “The chapter’s key findings largely miss the opportunity to make what could be the chapter’s central point,” the reviewers said. “A consequence of the essentially permanent nature of warming from CO2 is that stabilization of CO2 at any given concentration can only be achieved if CO2 emissions fall to zero.” “Stabilizing warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2 degrees C requires emissions to fall to zero within a few decades, and even stabilizing warming at 3 degrees C or 4 degrees C requires zero emissions a few decades later,” they noted. That point doesn’t come across clearly enough in the chapter, the review concluded. “Specifically, it is important to emphasize the point that, for any mitigation goal, slower action in the near term requires more aggressive reductions or larger negative emissions later in the century.” Coming from one of the world’s most august scientific organizations that is specifically charged with giving apolitical advice to the U.S. government, the message may resonate at a time when science itself is under political challenge.

Though harder to spot, the impacts on people’s mental health can be pervasive and enduring. That is the thrust of a report released Wednesday by the American Psychological Association, Climate for Health, and ecoAmerica, called “Mental Health and Our Changing Climate: Impacts, Implications, and Guidance.” The report builds on previous work and examines the harm caused by the various manifestations of climate change, from extreme weather and wildfires to heat waves and the general “eco-anxiety” that comes from coping with the enormity of the climate crisis. “We have this strange situation with climate change in our country that people don’t talk about it much, and that means we don’t have the opportunity to get prepared for it,” said Susan Clayton, one of the report’s authors. “That makes it scarier. It seems so amorphous.” The news about climate change can be so frightening, so overwhelming, that instead of shaking people into awareness, it can drive them toward denial. One study cited by the report found that people who received complex information about the threat of climate change felt more helpless and more likely to want to avoid hearing about it in the future. “Talking about it makes it more manageable and concrete. It can also increase the political will to do something about it,” said Clayton. Climate change’s potential impact on mental health isn’t universal. Some groups, particularly children and the poor, can be particularly vulnerable. The report pointed to the response to heat as an example. By the end of the century, the average American will see between four and eight times as many days above 95 degrees as today, according to estimates cited in the report.

    "date": "2017-03-29T16:44:52-04:00",
    "content": "Within hours of moving by executive order to dismantle U.S. actions on the climate change crisis, the Trump Administration asked a federal court to stand down on pending litigation over the Clean Power Plan. The legal salvo could keep regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants in limbo for the foreseeable future. The Justice Department on Tuesday asked the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which heard oral arguments months ago in a case challenging the landmark Obama-era regulations, “to hold cases in abeyance.” Last February the Supreme Court issued a stay of the rules, and the appeals court has not yet ruled. “The Clean Power Plan is under close scrutiny by the EPA, and the prior positions taken by the agency with respect to the Rule do not necessarily reflect its ultimate conclusions,” the department said in a motion to the appeals court. “Deferral of further judicial proceedings is thus warranted,” it said. Instead of facing an imminent but unpredictable ruling on the merits by the federal court best versed in the complexity of this case, the Justice Department and its client, the Environmental Protection Agency, asked for a standstill “until 30 days after the conclusion of review and any resulting forthcoming rulemaking.” Whether or not the appeals court defers its decision, the central pillar of the Obama administration’s climate action plans seems likely to be on ice for at least a few years. Even if the appeals court disregarded this request and issued a ruling wholly upholding the Obama rules, the case would then face review by the Supreme Court. According to the Justice Department’s filing, the green groups and their allies “intend to file motions in opposition,” which means that at the very least there will be a detour in the lengthy litigation. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said that he will file in opposition to the Trump administration’s motion on behalf of a coalition of 23 states, cities and counties who are seeking to uphold the Clean Power Plan. “The case was fully briefed and argued before the full D.C. Circuit six months ago, and the fate of the rule is now in the court’s hands,” Schneiderman’s spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, said in an email. Some environmentalists have argued that the slow-motion course makes little difference as a practical matter, since power plants have been cleaning up their emissions and appear likely to meet the near-term goals of the Clean Power Plan. Meanwhile, Trump’s EPA cannot replace the Obama rules with anything softer without going through a time-consuming review process, which green groups and their allies would fight. But it’s clear that the Trump team and its allies in the fossil fuel industry and coal-friendly states have no problem with letting matters drag on. The Justice Department argued that its green opponents “face no immediate harm from the postponement of judicial review,” and noted that “no carbon dioxide emission reductions are required from sources under the Rule until",

    "content": "A group of Harvard University students urging university officials to pull the school’s investments from fossil fuel companies blocked the entrance to one of the university’s main administrative buildings. They promised to stay until the end of the business day. The group of approximately 20 undergraduate students gathered at the entrances to Harvard’s University Hall at 6:00 a.m. on Wednesday, demanding that the university commit to a permanent divestment from coal companies and hold an open, community-wide meeting on fossil fuel divestment. Harvard currently does not have any investments in coal companies in its $35.7 billion endowment though school officials have said they do not rule out re-investing in coal in the future. The protest, organized by the group Divest Harvard, comes after Harvard President Drew Faust declined the group’s request earlier this year for a permanent divestment from coal. Divest Harvard wrote a letter to Faust on Feb. 17 asking her to reconsider because of President Trump’s promise to repeal efforts by the Obama administration to control emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. Faust responded with a letter on March 20 reiterating the university’s refusal to divest. “The shift in the political landscape does not alter the University’s fundamental aversion to instrumentalizing the endowment as a means of seeking to influence the political process,” Faust wrote. “Deploying the endowment as a tool to intervene in the political process or as a lever to advance broader social objectives, even eminently worthy ones, poses risks to the independence of the academic enterprise. Those risks are no less real now than before.” Nearly 700 institutions and 58,400 individuals representing at least $5 trillion in assets have divested from fossil fuel companies, one group promoting and tracking the divestment movement reported in December.

    "date": "2017-03-27T20:00:12-04:00",
    "content": "Scott Pruitt, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has for weeks been developing his arguments for the Trump Administration’s climate-policy rollback. There will be more to come with the release on Tuesday of a long-promised executive order from the White House aimed at undermining Obama-era action on climate change. Pruitt’s recent denial of mainstream climate science was not his only false note. In an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, he made several pronouncements that don’t stand up well to scrutiny. Here are five of them: “Over the last several years, we have accepted a narrative that if you’re pro-growth, pro-jobs, you’re anti-environment; if you’re pro-environment, you’re anti-jobs or anti-growth.” It’s not clear where Pruitt has been hearing this narrative. Not from former President Barack Obama. Nor from John Kerry or Ernest Moniz or Gina McCarthy. The four, like Democrats and Republicans alike in recent decades, have gone on endlessly about how this is a false choice. “We need to be more independent, less reliant, upon foreign energy sources.” There has been a steady increase in U.S. energy independence over several years, as repeatedly described in official government data. In the next breath, Pruitt cited the importance of the newly approved Keystone XL pipeline. That project would mainly carry foreign oil, from Canada’s tar sands. And the Obama administration, along with Democrats and Republicans in Congress, cut a deal more than a year ago to open up crude oil exports, given the supply glut that has held prices low. The U.S., meanwhile, became a net exporter of natural gas last year, and has always had plenty of coal. “What was wrong with Paris was not just that it was, you know, failed to be treated as a treaty, but China and India got away, the largest producers of CO2 internationally, got away scot-free. They didn’t have to take steps until",

    "date": "2017-04-06T15:30:58-04:00",
    "content": "Peru’s worst floods in nearly a century have killed more than 70 people, left 70,000 homeless in nearly every province and damaged 130,000 structures, including ancient archaeological sites. The downpours inundated the country in the first half of March, then moved north over Colombia, causing a mudslide that killed hundreds. The intense rain and flooding in Peru took emergency workers and scientists by surprise, because such extreme downpours typically are associated with a large-scale El Niño phenomenon. But the latest El Niño ended nearly a year ago. The flooding instead has been linked to an exceptional and sudden emergence of extra-warm ocean waters just off Peru’s coast, what scientists call a coastal El Niño. Since mid-March, NOAA satellites have showed this patch of the eastern Pacific as the most anomalously warm ocean region in the world. It won’t be clear whether human-caused global warming was a direct factor in the flooding unless scientists do an attribution study. That would determine how much the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases increased the odds of it happening. But the unusual flooding is consistent with the extreme weather expected as climate change warms the oceans, according to scientists. “There’s been a big increase in really heavy rainfalls around the world. Storms are moving more slowly, carrying more moisture. That’s the new normal,” Jim White, said director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “At 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, pretty much everything should be carrying a signature of climate change, it would be odd if it didn’t. The question is not so much is this event caused by climate change. The question is, which event is not?” Since the",

    "title": "House Republicans’ Group Launches Effort to Tackle Climate Change",
    "date": "2017-03-15T19:27:28-04:00",
    "content": "A group of 17 House Republicans introduced a resolution on Wednesday that calls for the House to commit to working on climate change solutions that keep in mind the health of the economy. The resolution makes the argument that it is a conservative principle to “protect, conserve and be good stewards of the environment, responsibility plan for all market factors, and base our policy decisions in science and quantifiable fact.” Though it stops short of recognizing the connection between emissions from fossil fuels and climate change, it is a departure from the outright climate denial promoted by many Republican congressmen and Trump administration appointees. Former Rep. Bob Inglis, a Republican from South Carolina, who has embraced the science of climate change and who advocated for a carbon tax while in office, called the resolution “really exciting.” In particular, he found the involvement of Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) to be a promising sign. “Mark is a true fiscal conservative who understands markets and is unassailably conservative,” Inglis said. Having Sanford as a part of the effort—which is led by Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Fla.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) and Ryan Costello (Penn.)—is an important stamp of approval, Inglis said. Inglis said the resolution does a good job of framing the threat of climate change as an opportunity for “American ingenuity, innovation, and exceptionalism”—something that could allow those who previously denied climate change to come into the fold. “If you tell me the apocalypse is upon me I will shrink in science denial because it’s a pretty good coping mechanism,” Inglis said. “But if you start the conversation with, ‘There are ways to be ingenious here and ways that Americans can lead,’ now I’m feeling efficacious. Engagement is now my coping mechanism.” That the resolution doesn’t acknowledge fossil fuel emissions as the driver of climate change did not come as a surprise to Inglis. “These leaders are trying to shape public opinion and lead public opinion, and that is best done gently,” Inglis said. “We don’t think many people are going to have the ability to do a 180 on this.” The move garnered applause from various environmental groups. “It is good to see more Republican Members of Congress acknowledging the science of climate change,” Alex Taurel, the deputy legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters said in a press release. “I’m heartened to see Republican House members introduce a resolution committing Congress to address climate change and base its policy decisions on science and quantifiable facts,” Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a press release. “If Congress followed the science it would, of course, see that fossil fuel emissions are driving climate change,” Kimmel said in his statement. “While the resolution doesn’t explicitly make this link, it shows that these Republican lawmakers are not in a state of denial about this key issue.” Curbelo has led the effort to bring Republicans into the climate conversation. He co-founded the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in",

    "date": "2017-03-17T19:27:15-04:00",
    "content": "As the environmental world copes with the budget outline unveiled by President Trump on Thursday, two former EPA administrators and a longtime environmental justice official have more sobering news: It’s actually worse than you think. The budget blueprint handed down from the White House sent the unmistakable message that it plans to take a hacksaw to climate action. And no agency fell more directly in its path than the Environmental Protection Agency. “Literally and figuratively this budget is a scorched earth budget,” said Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator under President Obama. “It represents really an all-out assault on clean air and clean water and our ability to have safe homes, schools and places to work.” The budget outline proposes a 31 percent cut to the total EPA budget, including a 45 percent reduction in state funds and the elimination of 3,200 positions under new administrator Scott Pruitt, a longtime antagonist of the agency. Those cuts, McCarthy pointed out, represent one in five agency employees. Forty two percent of the scientists in the Office in Research and Development—the agency’s scientific research arm—will lose their jobs, she said. “This budget is even more challenging than it looks at first glance,” McCarthy said, because the total proposed budget includes $2.3 billion in State Revolving Funds, which are given directly to states to dole out to communities for infrastructure improvements. “When you take that out of the picture, the rest of the budget is going to be cut from $6 billion to $3.4 billion. That’s actually a 43 percent cut in the ability to implement all of the clean water and clear air and clean land programs,” she said. “Not to mention our ability to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time which is climate change.” McCarthy was joined on a conference call Friday by Carol Browner, a fellow former EPA administrator, Mustafa Ali, who recently resigned as EPA advisor for environmental justice, and Nicole Hernandez Hammer, a climate advocate for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

    "title": "Scientists Call Out Pruitt’s False View of Climate Change",
    "date": "2017-03-13T18:00:20-04:00",
    "content": "Thirty prominent climate scientists sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt on Monday, refuting his recent false statement that carbon dioxide is not a primary driver of climate change. “Just as there is no escaping gravity when one steps off a cliff, there is no escaping the warming that follows when we add extra carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,” the scientists wrote. The group included Nobel laureate chemist Mario Molina of the University of California, San Diego, and eight members of the National Academies of Science. The EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. It joined the avalanche of response to Pruitt’s statement last week in an interview on CNBC that he did not agree carbon dioxide was the primary contributor to global warming, a statement contrary to the overwhelming scientific consensus. Phone calls to Pruitt’s main line reached such a high volume the following day that officials created an impromptu call center, the Washington Post reported. By Saturday morning, calls were going straight to voice mail, which said it was full and would not accept messages. In addition to the letter by the climate scientists, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) forwarded a letter to Pruitt that contained its official statement on climate change and carbon dioxide’s role in the rapid change of the past half-century. That conclusion is “based on multiple independent lines of evidence that have been affirmed by thousands of independent scientists and numerous scientific institutions around the world,” wrote AMS executive director Keith Seitter. “We are not familiar with any scientific institution with relevant subject matter expertise that has reached a different conclusion.” The American Geophysical Society last week posted on its website a response to Pruitt’s statement, noting that its own statement on global warming “leaves no doubt that increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide resulting from human activity is the dominant source of climate change during the last several decades.” Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University who was one of the signers of the scientists’ letter, said that he and his colleagues began contemplating an official response to Pruitt soon after his statement. “I have no idea how he made this error, whether it’s intentional spinning of the facts, or, as I prefer to think, he really doesn’t know,” Oppenheimer said. ” We and any number of climate scientists would be perfectly happy to brief him about what’s known and what isn’t known and what the uncertainties really are.” Pruitt made clear in his CNBC interview, as he did in his confirmation hearing, that he thought the uncertainties were great enough to forestall policy. “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,” Pruitt said. The doubts he expressed went further than in his testimony before Congress, however, as he said of carbon dioxide, “No, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” The scientists said Pruitt was misrepresenting how much scientists do know. “Focusing on disagreements over details, or among a few individuals on the margins of consensus, or on the uncertainties that are part of any accurate statement of scientific knowledge, misses the big picture: Human beings are changing the Earth’s climate,” they wrote.

    "date": "2017-03-09T19:00:25-05:00",
    "content": "Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday it will sell nearly all of its tar sands assets, the latest sign that operations in the Canadian resource continue to struggle as oil prices remain historically low and energy companies come under increasing pressure to reduce their impacts on climate change. The sale, to Canadian Natural Resources Limited, is one of the biggest in a series of steps by multinational companies to turn away from the tar sands, among the most expensive and carbon-intensive sources of oil. “You’re seeing this real accelerating pull out by the industry from what was once the crown jewel of oil projects, so it’s a big deal,” said Andrew Logan, director of the oil and gas program at Ceres, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable investing. “I think it’s a tipping point for the oil sands as an investible resource.” For Shell, it’s part of a shift toward operations with lower costs and a lower carbon footprint. The company also disclosed details of a new policy to tie 10 percent of annual bonuses to management of greenhouse gas emissions from its operations. The $7.25 billion deal covers all of Shell’s 2 billion barrels of tar sands reserves, and will be used to help pay off debt acquired after the company bought a major player in liquefied natural gas last year. “This announcement is a significant step in reshaping Shell’s portfolio in line with our long-term strategy,” Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement. He said the company will focus on projects with higher returns and areas where Shell has a competitive advantage, including natural gas and deep-water drilling. While the sale will move Shell out of the business of operating oil sands projects, the company will continue to hold a substantial stake in the resource. Part of the deal includes a transfer to Shell of $3.1 billion worth of shares in Canadian Natural Resources. Shell will also continue to operate a facility that upgrades tar sands into crude oil and a project that captures carbon emissions from some of its tar sands operations. The announcement comes just weeks after Exxon disclosed that had reduced its oil sands reserves estimate by 3.5 billion barrels, an acknowledgement that its newest Kearl project is not currently economical. Unlike Shell, however, Exxon said it will continue to operate Kearl and all of its oil sands projects. ConocoPhillips also recently reduced its reserves, by more than 1 billion barrels. “It continues a trend of consolidation of oil sands interests into the hands of the largest Canadian companies,” said Michael Dunn, an analyst with GMP FirstEnergy. Logan said the exit of multinationals—with Exxon as a notable exception—will mean oil sands operations will have less access to capital from investors. While the Shell deal represents a major hit for the oil sands, it hardly comes as a surprise, said Simon Dyer, Alberta director at the Pembina Institute, a Canadian research and advocacy group. “I think it does send a signal that you’ve been seeing in the oil sands for the past couple of years,” he said. The combination of high costs, low oil prices and a growing sense that governments will begin regulating carbon emissions has made many investors turn away from oil sands, Dyer said. “Those things together send a pretty strong signal.” Kevin Birn, an analyst with IHS Energy, said the Shell deal is another sign that oil sands growth will continue to be sluggish. Multinationals are putting their money elsewhere, he said, leaving fewer companies willing to invest. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "EPA Head Pruitt Denies the Basic Science of Climate Change",
    "date": "2017-03-09T18:20:33-05:00",
    "content": "Wrapping himself unabashedly in the mantle of climate science denial, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt declared on Thursday that he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming. The statement contradicts a firmly established tenet of climate change science. By questioning it, Pruitt appeared to signal a coming challenge by the Trump administration to the agency’s key science finding that obligates it to regulate carbon dioxide pollution from the burning of fossil fuels. It sparked a chorus of unambiguous contradiction from leading scientists, including those working at the foremost government institutions. “Mr. Pruitt is wrong,” said one of them, Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “Embracing ignorance is not an option.” John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Obama, called Pruitt’s claim “the purest ignorance.” “There is simply no scientific question,” Holdren said. “The evidence for climate change caused by humans and principally by CO2 comes from many different lines of observation, monitoring, research, analysis. It’s all consistent.” In an interview on CNBC‘s Squawk Box program, Pruitt was asked by host Joe Kernen if he believes that carbon dioxide is the “primary control knob for climate.” “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact,” Pruitt answered. “So no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.” Pruitt added, “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” Kernen also denied that the consensus science was “settled.” The most recent authoritative statement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which represents the global scientific consensus, declared that “it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” That human influence comes mainly from increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture and the like. Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy denounced her successor’s remarks. “The world of science is about empirical evidence, not beliefs,” she wrote in a statement. “I cannot imagine what additional information the administrator might want from scientists for him to understand that.” McCarthy went on to condemn the Trump administration’s larger campaign to remove government scientists who believe human activity contributes to global warming. “Giving pink slips to scientists across the federal government, including 43 percent of EPA scientists, and proposing to eliminate the U.S. Climate Global Research Program in its entirety, makes one question who this administration will rely on for scientific research and facts.” She was referring to a plan that, if approved, would cut funding for the EPA’s Office of Research and Development by 43 percent. Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. said Pruitt is denying what has been indisputably verified. “There is no doubt whatsoever that the planet is warming and it is primarily due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels,” he said. “Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and we can demonstrate clearly that the observed warming of the planet would not have occurred without that change in atmospheric composition. These are scientific facts, not opinion, and it is incumbent on politicians to take account of the scientific evidence.” Pruitt’s statement on CNBC went beyond his more guarded words at his Senate confirmation hearings, when his record of climate denial was under intense scrutiny by Democrats. “The climate is changing and human activity contributes to that in some manner,” he said in response to a question from Sen. Bernie Sanders. “I believe the ability to measure with precision the degree of human activity’s impact on the climate is subject to more debate.” This time, there was no way to construe his remarks as being consistent with mainstream science. In a written response to questions from senators that he submitted during his confirmation process, Pruitt said he would fulfill the duties of the administrator in regulating greenhouse gases. “As Pruitt testified before Congress, it is the legal duty of the EPA to tackle the carbon pollution that fuels the climate crisis,” Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, said in a statement. “Pruitt is endangering our families, and any sensible senator should demand he be removed from his position immediately for misleading Congress and being unfit and unwilling to do the job he has been entrusted to do.” David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he considered the situation bizarre. “Having an EPA administrator who claims carbon pollution is not the primary cause of climate change is like having a U.S. surgeon general who says smoking is not the primary cause of lung cancer.” Sabrina Shankman contributed reporting to this story.

    "date": "2017-03-13T15:33:37-04:00",
    "content": "As a meeting of senior Arctic officials drew to a close Friday, U.S. Ambassador David Balton delivered the message that the United States’ policy on Arctic issues hasn’t changed under President Trump—yet. Senior officials from the eight Arctic states gathered in Juneau, Alaska, last week to prepare for the end of the United States’ two-year chairmanship of the Arctic Council and for the handing of that torch to Finland. The Arctic Council is the intergovernmental body charged with coordinating the eight Arctic states: Canada; Denmark, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands; Finland; Iceland; Norway; Russia; Sweden and the United States—along with a number of observer nations, indigenous groups and organizations. The United States’ time as chair, which will end in May, began with a strong emphasis on climate change and on raising the profile of Arctic issues within the United States, with President Obama creating a new position to work with the council, U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic. Obama’s secretary of state John Kerry named retired Coast Guard Adm. Robert J. Papp Jr. to the post. Now, the Trump administration has signaled steep budget cuts are ahead for agencies dealing with environment and climate issues—as well as to the State Department, which represents the United States on the council. Papp stepped down late last year, and Trump has not indicated whether he will fill the post. So far, though, it appears the agenda for the U.S. chairmanship that was set two years ago—which included improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities; Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship and the impacts of climate change—remains intact. “I think it’s fair to say that there has been no fundamental change in the way the United States participates in the Arctic Council—yet,” Balton said at a press conference. “This administration … may wish to put its own stamp on Arctic policy,” but so far, it has not happened. “We of course are in touch with the new administration,” he said. “And for the most part now our guidance now is to keep doing what we’re doing.” Balton dismissed rumors that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin might attend the council’s ministerial meeting in May and said there is no word yet whether secretary of state Rex Tillerson, technically the chair of the council, will be there. The past three Arctic Council ministerial meetings have been attended by the sitting secretary of state. The May meeting will include the unveiling of Finland’s priorities for its chairmanship. A draft list of priorities includes education, meteorology, improved information technology and connectivity, as well as implementation of the Paris climate agreement. Traditionally, the Arctic Council has been a space where work has been accomplished regardless of political tensions in other spheres. Russia, for instance, has continued to work productively with the council through U.S.-led sanctions against it. Balton and others have said they expect that that will be the case with the Trump administration. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "As Budget Cuts Loom, Former EPA Officials Make Plea to Trump to Continue Agency’s Work",
    "date": "2017-03-02T20:50:45-05:00",
    "content": "Three former high-ranking U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials urged the Trump administration not to sacrifice environmental quality and the health of the American people for special interest stakeholders. The plea came in an opinion piece published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which was published on Wednesday just as reports surfaced that the administration plans deep cuts to the agency. Those surround an Office of Management and Budget proposal for reducing EPA staff by 20 percent and eliminating dozens of programs, including those involving environmental justice and climate change. “Unfortunately, sowing doubt about scientific evidence has become a widely used strategy for delaying or blocking actions that are purported to potentially affect the bottom lines for particular industries,” the former officials wrote. “We need to maintain the capacity to conduct cutting-edge research and to grapple with the application of the results in formulating evidence-based policies.” The article was authored by Jonathan Samet, former chair of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, Thomas Burke, until January the agency’s top science adviser, and Bernard Goldstein, who was assistant administrator for research and development during the Reagan administration. The authors listed a prescription for the administration, seeking continued reliance on science for decision-making, increased funding for science, continued environmental surveillance and preparation for disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and continued efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change. Before the article was published, the Trump administration had already signaled it was moving largely in the opposition direction. Programs designated for elimination or major cuts under draft instructions leaked to the Washington Post include environmental justice programs, climate change initiatives including funds for implementing the Clean Power Plan, funding for Alaskan native villages, and the EPA’s Global Change Research Program, which develops scientific information that informs policymakers on climate change and its impacts on human health, ecosystems, and society. (The EPA’s Global Change Research Program is just one part of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a program involving 13 federal agencies, including the EPA. The USGCRP produces a comprehensive National Climate Assessment every several years and would not necessarily be impacted by EPA budget cuts.) Cuts to the EPA’s budget would have to be approved by Congress. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-03-03T15:44:16-05:00",
    "content": "In a strong signal of its retreat from climate change action, the Trump administration on Thursday halted an effort to gather data from the oil and gas industry that is needed to rein in leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. More than 15,000 owners and operators of oil and gas production or processing facilities had been required to submit information on their equipment and operations to the Environmental Protection Agency under an order finalized by the Obama administration in November. With the first deadline of early January already passed and another submission due in May, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced he was withdrawing that request, effective immediately. The Obama administration had called the survey “a critical step” in its effort to control methane, the main component of natural gas. Emissions of the odorless, colorless gas have proven nearly impossible to measure at 700,000 well sites and thousands of pipelines and facilities across the country. Although technology for controlling those emissions is readily available for oil and gas operations, industry has resisted. Getting the exact numbers is particularly crucial to understanding whether the nation’s fracking boom will accelerate or could help stall global warming. Although gas-fired power plants release half as much carbon dioxide as coal plants, the extraction, production and transport of natural gas releases unknown amounts of methane. Last May, the EPA finalized rules for methane at new oil and gas operations and at the same time issued a first draft of a request to collect information from the industry on existing facilities, a massive task. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has such authority; penalties of nearly $100,000 a day are possible for those who fail to comply. Then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy noted that there were hundreds of thousands of small sources of leaks, including pumps, storage tanks and processes that the agency didn’t know existed. “EPA is learning this industry right now,” she said. Now, Pruitt says he will assess whether the information is needed. Pruitt acted one day after receiving a letter from nine state attorneys general and the governors of Mississippi and Kentucky, expressing concern about the burden posed by the data gathering. “By taking this step, EPA is signaling that we take these concerns seriously and are committed to strengthening our partnership with the states,” Pruitt said in a statement. As Oklahoma attorney general and a leader in the Republican Attorneys General Association, Pruitt was critical of the EPA’s actions on methane, submitting a letter in",

    "content": "Stay informed about the latest climate, energy and environmental justice news by email. Sign up for the ICN newsletter. Huge slabs of Arctic permafrost in northwest Canada are slumping and disintegrating, sending large amounts of carbon-rich mud and silt into streams and rivers. A new study that analyzed nearly a half-million square miles in northwest Canada found that this permafrost decay is affecting 52,000 square miles of that vast stretch of earth—an expanse the size of Alabama. According to researchers with the Northwest Territories Geological Survey, the permafrost collapse is intensifying and causing landslides into rivers and lakes that can choke off life downstream, all the way to where the rivers discharge into the Arctic Ocean. Similar large-scale landscape changes are evident across the Arctic including in Alaska, Siberia and Scandinavia, the researchers wrote in a paper published in the journal Geology in early February. The study didn’t address the issue of greenhouse gas releases from thawing permafrost. But its findings could help quantify the immense global scale of the thawing, which will contribute to more accurate estimates of carbon emissions. Permafrost is land that has been frozen stretching back to the last ice age, 10,000 years ago. As the Arctic warms at twice the global rate, the long-frozen soils thaw and decompose, releasing the trapped greenhouse gases into the air. Scientists estimate that the world’s permafrost holds twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. The new study was aimed at measuring the geographical scope of thawing permafrost in northwest Canada. Using satellite images and other data, the team studied the edge of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet, a vast expanse of ice that covered two-thirds of North America during the last ice age. The disintegration of the permafrost was visible in 40- to 60-mile wide swaths of terrain, showing that, “extensive landscapes remain poised for major climate-driven change.” “Things have really taken off. Climate warming is now making that happen. It’s exactly what we should expect with climate change,” said Steven V. Kokelj, lead scientist on the Canadian mapping project. “And the maps that we produced clearly indicated it’s not just a random pattern. We’re sort of connecting dots here for the scientific community.” Other global evidence of similar large-scale permafrost changes have recently been documented in Siberia, where scientists with the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Sussex (UK) are monitoring another rapidly growing scar in the earth. More than a half-mile of once-frozen ground has collapsed 280-feet deep, according to their study published in in the journal Quaternary Research in February. The researchers said they expect to see the rolling tundra landscape transform, including the formation of large new valleys and lakes. Similar signs are evident in coastal Arctic areas, where thawing permafrost and bigger waves are taking 60- to 70-foot bites of land each year, according to researchers with the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. Writing in the journal Nature Climate Change in January, AWI scientists warned about collapsing coastlines and urged more research, with input from policymakers and native communities. University of Alberta scientists Suzanne Tank, who was not involved in the new study, said that the release of sediments from the new slumps in the Canadian permafrost has significant ecological implications. The pulses of silt, mud and gravel make streams murkier and limit growth of aquatic plants at the base of the food chain. Exactly how that affects other species, including fish, is the subject of ongoing research. Scientists know thawing permafrost unlocks carbon. But according to Tank, most of the carbon in the Canadian melting is being released quickly as coarse particles that aren’t converted to CO2 immediately. But separate research by Swedish scientists suggests that the soil particles are quickly converted to heat-trapping CO2 when they are swept into the sea. A series of studies on the National Institute of Health’s Arctic Health website documents how the widespread thaw of permafrost is already having direct impacts on people. Warmer water and increased sediment loads are harming lake trout, an important source of food for native communities. Changes to the land surface are also disrupting caribou breeding and migration, and in some places, the disappearing permafrost has destroyed traditional food storage cellars, researchers have found. At lower latitudes, permafrost is the glue that holds the world’s highest mountains together by keeping rocks and soil frozen in place. Scientists are documenting how those bonds are dissolving, said Stefan Reisenhofer, a climate scientist with the Austrian Bureau of Meteorology and Geodynamics. “We’ve seen a significant reduction in the number of ice days (those with 24 hours of sub-freezing temperatures), especially in the summer months,” said Reisenhofer, who works at a climate observatory at an elevation of 8,500 feet. “From",

    "date": "2017-03-01T17:46:06-05:00",
    "content": "A coalition of 15 Democratic state attorneys general has urged Congressman Lamar Smith to withdraw subpoenas sent to the AGs of Massachusetts and New York seeking records related to their investigations of ExxonMobil. In a letter to Smith sent Tuesday, the attorneys general argue the demand for documents interferes with the investigative authority of the states. The attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York have ongoing investigations of Exxon under each state’s securities and consumer protection laws related to whether Exxon properly disclosed risks posed by climate change to the company’s business. “Under the Constitution and the principle of comity that has been honored by Congress and federal courts since the Nation’s founding, the states’ attorneys general must be free to fulfill the responsibilites they owe to the people they serve, unimpeded by interference from a committee of Congress,” the AGs said in the letter. Smith, a 15-term Texas Republican who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, first subpoenaed the Massachusetts and New York state AGs last July. He followed last month with a second subpoena seeking records that delve into the investigative strategy of the AGs, a tactic critics say is an attempt to shield Exxon from scrutiny. Smith has said the attorneys general investigations amount to a crusade to silence alternative views of climate change, and that his probe is designed to protect the First Amendment rights of academic institutions, scientists and companies engaged in climate research. He has used his chairmanship to launch prior investigations questioning the work of climate scientists. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in July that they would not comply with the subpoenas. In September, Smith extended his subpoena to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had reportedly launched a related investigation into Exxon. At the same time, Smith also hit eight non-governmental environmental advocacy organizations with subpoenas, which demanded documents related to any discussions with the AGs regarding the Exxon investigations. The group of attorneys general called on Smith to withdraw his subpoenas. The letter states that the New York and Massachusetts investigations are lawful and that the House Committee’s subpoena threatens to interfere with pending court proceedings involving Exxon. “The AGs’ letter makes clear that chairman Smith has no authority to interfere with our investigation,” Chloe Gotsis, spokeswoman for Attorney General Maura Healey said. “He should read it and stop this harassment.” “Lamar Smith has repeatedly put Big Oil’s interests above the people Congress is supposed to serve—doing whatever he can to help Exxon distract from and delay multiple state and federal fraud investigations,” Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for the New York attorney general’s office said. “As we’ve made clear, Attorney General Schneiderman’s investigation will not be deterred.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Fearing Attack on the Endangered Species Act, Groups Make Plea to Governors",
    "date": "2017-02-24T19:49:08-05:00",
    "content": "Nearly 300 environmental and social justice groups are calling on the nation’s governors to oppose attempts to amend the Endangered Species Act, trying to head off what appears to be shaping up as a series of attacks against the landmark law. In a letter sent to the National Governors Association on Thursday, the organizations warned the group against endorsing any rewrite of the act during the governors’ annual meeting this weekend. “In the current political environment,” the organizations wrote, “any effort to open up the law would likely weaken, if not cripple, its ability to conserve and recover our nation’s most imperiled plants and animals.” The advocacy organizations said they expect an attempt this weekend by the Western Governors Association (WGA) to have the national group join its campaign for reforming the law. The National Governors Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, the WGA adopted a resolution calling on Congress to amend the Endangered Species Act by setting clear criteria for removing recovered species, increasing regulatory flexibility and expanding the role of state governments. The resolution also said using climate change as a factor for listing species as endangered makes it difficult to create a timeline for recovery or a management plan. It said the act “may not be equipped to address this potential global threat to species and habitat.” Republicans in Congress, led by members from Western states, have said they intend to amend or repeal the law because it does not help species recover fast enough. The WGA’s executive director, Jim Ogsbury, testified last week at a Senate hearing on “modernizing” the act, telling lawmakers that it is “premised on a strong state-federal partnership. Western Governors submit that such cooperation should involve full and authentic partnership between the states and Services with respect to species listing, critical habitat designations, establishment of recovery goals and delisting decisions.” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which held the hearing, said the act should be amended to improve recovery rates and de-listings. But the organizations behind Thursday’s letter to governors, including the Center for Biological Diversity and the Humane Society, said those arguments are specious attempts to gut the act. Their letter issues a forceful defense of the law, saying it has prevented the extinction of 99 percent of the species listed. They argue that recoveries take decades, while the law was adopted only 44 years ago. More than 700 species, or nearly half those listed, have been protected for fewer than 20 years, according to the letter. “It is simply not biologically possible for most species to have recovered yet, but many species are recovering at the pace expected by scientists and conservationists at the state and federal wildlife agencies.” It said 11 species recovered last year enough to be de-listed or upgraded from endangered to threatened. The letter also noted a lawsuit filed by landowners in Utah (who named their group People for the Ethical Treatment of Property Owners) arguing that the act should not apply to creatures that live within only one state. A federal judge agreed with the plaintiffs in",

    "content": "Every federal agency will set up a task force dedicated to quickly finding regulations to eliminate, as mandated by an executive order signed Friday by President Donald Trump. It is one of a series of moves the White House believes will free U.S. businesses from the bonds of health, safety, consumer and environmental protections. Surrounded by executives from some of the nation’s largest corporations, Trump made clear his anti-regulatory drive is a large part of his jobs-creation plan. Although Trump did not mention climate change in the order, this step to rein in the regulators is intended, among other things, to constrain their actions to control emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants from fossil fuels. “Every regulation should pass a simple test,” Trump said as he signed the order. “Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers? If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it and getting rid of it quickly.” The regulatory reform task forces will be required to report on their progress within 90 days. The White House issued a statement saying that the Obama administration had finalized more than 3,000 regulations, at a total cost to the American taxpayer of $873 billion.

Its analysis of the United States Global Change Research Program, which coordinates research by 13 federal agencies and departments, reads as a vigorous defense of the program’s work. It comes just as those agencies’ research faces intense scrutiny by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. As the effects of climate change become even more apparent in coming years, the NAS recommended that the program “build on its accomplishments by sustaining, expanding, and coordinating observations of the Earth system and maintaining a balanced program of discovery-driven and use-inspired research to support the needs of the nation at local, regional, national, and global scales.” The academy’s charter is to advise the government on sound science policies and its report comes one month into a new administration that has expressed skepticism about some of the program’s core findings. Republicans in Congress have also targeted funding for some of the research it oversees. President Donald Trump’s nominees issued a range of carefully constructed comments about climate change during their confirmation hearings, often hedging when asked about humanity’s role in driving global warming or what ought to be done in response.

    "date": "2017-02-23T08:00:29-05:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil announced Wednesday that it had wiped off its books all 3.5 billion barrels of tar sands oil reserves at one of its projects in Canada. Because of recent low oil prices, the company said none of those reserves can be considered economical according to the accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accounting change at its Kearl project, a momentous if expected development, represented a turnaround for the company, which has long resisted calls to revise its reserves estimates. Over the past decade, Exxon had steadily increased its holdings in Canada’s tar sands to become a leading producer there. Exxon also removed from its books 800 million barrels of oil-equivalent reserves in North America, though the reductions were offset by the addition of 1 billion barrels of oil and gas elsewhere. Exxon said in October that low prices would likely force it to “de-book” up to 4.6 billion barrels of reserves in its end-of-year accounting. Securities and Exchange Commission rules allow oil companies to count reserves only if they are profitable based on average prices over the previous year. But while the accounting change removes billions of dollars worth of tar sands investments from the company’s annual report, and is watched closely by investors, it will not directly affect operations. Exxon plans to continue operating its Kearl project, and said it will add back the reserves if oil prices rise or costs drop. After the reduction, the company now reports holding 1.3 billion barrels of tar sands reserves. Exxon will hold an analyst meeting on March 1. Earlier this week, ConocoPhillips said it had reduced its oil sands reserves by more than 1 billion barrels, bringing its total to 1.2 billion for",

    "content": "UPDATE (February 24): The Oklahoma attorney general’s office released more than 7,500 pages of Scott Pruitt’s emails and other records on Feb. 22 in response to the district judge’s Feb. 16 order. The documents further reveal a coziness between Pruitt and the fossil fuel industry he is charged with regulating as administrator of the EPA. On Feb. 24, the attorney general’s office filed a motion for an emergency appeal with the state Supreme Court to block a second release of documents, scheduled for next week. The state Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing on the request for Feb. 28. An Oklahoma judge on Thursday ordered the state’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to quickly release thousands of pages of documents after years of delay. The records could reveal details of his relationship with the fossil fuel industry, which he will be in charge of regulating nationwide once confirmed as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The ruling, in response to a public records request from an advocacy group, came a day before a planned Senate vote to confirm Pruitt as Donald Trump‘s chief of the Environmental Protection Agency. The state judge gave Pruitt’s office until Tuesday to produce the records. Senate Democrats who have been seeking some of the same records tried to delay the confirmation vote, arguing that the documents requested could shed light on Pruitt’s ties to industries he would be charged with regulating as EPA administrator. Oklahoma district judge Aletia Haynes Timmons issued the order after agreeing to expedite a lawsuit brought by The Center for Media and Democracy ahead of the confirmation vote. Timmons ruled that “there was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable access to documents request by plaintiff.” CMD sued Pruitt earlier this month in Oklahoma state court, saying he had failed to produce public records in response to nine requests the group had submitted dating back to",

    "date": "2017-02-17T19:00:41-05:00",
    "content": "Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a close ally of the fossil fuel industry who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits challenging Environmental Protection Agency rules and authority, was confirmed on Friday to lead that agency. Senators voted nearly along party lines, 52-46, brushing off attempts by Democrats to delay confirmation until thousands of his emails are released. Pruitt’s confirmation followed a bitter fight in which Democrats raised concerns over Pruitt’s ties to an industry he would be regulating and his dismissal of mainstream climate change science. The Democrats held the Senate floor all night Thursday, hammering a message that if confirmed, Pruitt could gut the agency’s staff and set back progress on environmental protection. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who managed the debate for the Democrats, moved repeatedly for a delay in the vote until next week, when more than 2,000 of Pruitt’s email correspondence with the fossil fuel industry are to be released by the order of an Oklahoma judge. Each time, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) objected. “Government agencies like the EPA need their leadership in place, and they need it in place now,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, decrying the Democrats’ use of what he called “one delay tactic after another.” Sen. Thomas Carper (D-Del.), ranking member of the environment committee, said the judge’s ruling “has given us the opportunity to gain wisdom” on Pruitt. “Hit the pause button, let’s get the information next week, and make our decision then,” he said. Ultimately, a final vote to extend debate on Pruitt failed, and the round-the-clock vigil on the Senate floor—the third all-nighter against one of President Donald Trump‘s cabinet nominees—petered out. Two Democrats from fossil fuel-rich states, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, broke party ranks to support Pruitt. Only one Republican Senator, Susan Collins of Maine, opposed him. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who had expressed support for Pruitt, missed the vote to speak at a long-scheduled national security conference in Munich. Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) was also absent. Pruitt was expected to report right away to EPA headquarters, where many of the staff have spent months concerned about deep budget cuts, regulatory rollbacks and science suppression. On the campaign trail, Trump blasted EPA as a “disgrace” whose regulations under the Obama administration were to blame for job losses. “We’re going to get rid of it, EPA, in almost every form. We’re going to have little tidbits left, but we’re going to take a tremendous amount out,” Trump said in one speech. The EPA, with a budget of $8 billion, makes up two-tenths of 1 percent of the $3.2 trillion federal budget, but its mission to curb water and air pollution, including carbon dioxide emissions, has put the agency in conflict with some of the nation’s biggest and most politically powerful industries. Opponents fear that Pruitt, who sued the EPA at least 14 times in his six years as attorney general, is just as determined as Trump to carry out a radical retrenchment of the agency. “This is the wolf into the lamb’s fold,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a news conference of Democrats who led the all-nighter. At 4:30 a.m. on Friday, noting Pruitt’s downplaying of the urgency of climate change, Whitehouse used an aquarium bubbler and litmus paper to perform a rudimentary demonstration of the science of ocean acidification on the floor of the Senate. Pruitt’s supporters say that he will work to protect the environment by giving a larger role back to the states. “Over the past eight years, the political leaders of the EPA…have pushed broad and sweeping regulations that have hurt our economy and have failed to protect our environment,” Barrasso said during the debate. He singled out the Obama administration’s signature climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan, which regulates the emissions of electric utilities, as an example of what Pruitt would seek to undo. “Change is badly needed at the Environmental Protection Agency, and Scott Pruitt will be that change,” Barrasso said. While maintaining that the EPA has an “important role” in protecting water, air and land, Pruitt has made clear he believes the agency has overstepped the authority Congress gave it, especially in its efforts to control greenhouse gases. “We need to reject this paradigm that if you’re pro-energy you’re anti-environment, if you’re pro-environment, you’re anti-energy,” he said at his confirmation hearing. “We can grow an economy and also protect and be a good steward of our environment. And we need to restore that proper balance and commitment to both.” But Pruitt has never supported any program to achieve what mainstream scientists say is needed to head off the worst risks of global warming: steep, rapid reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from energy (eventually to zero). During his confirmation process, he said he did not think climate change was a hoax, as Trump has claimed. But he downplayed the established consensus that it is man-made and demands urgent action. “The climate is changing and human activity impacts our changing climate in some manner,” he said. “The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue.” Pruitt’s opponents say he has repeatedly given more weight to the industry’s agenda than to public health and welfare. He has gone to court to challenge the EPA’s rules to curb mercury pollution, cross-border air emissions and water pollution. He sued to overturn the Clean Power Plan, as well as the EPA’s endangerment finding, which underpins all of the agency’s rulemaking on greenhouse gases. He led a nonprofit group, the Rule of Law Defense Fund, funded in part by Charles and David Koch, the petrochemical billionaire brothers who have fought environmental regulations and clean energy.

Pruitt didn’t talk about policy specifics. Instead, he laid out a vision for an EPA that could avoid litigation in the future by limiting the agency’s ambitions under the mandates that Congress gave it and sticking to “process.” But environmental advocates already were preparing a vigorous legal defense of regulations they fear could be undone. They maintain the rules were subject to a rigorous public comment and debate, as well as court review.

    "date": "2017-02-14T17:48:06-05:00",
    "content": "Climate change may be harming far more of the world’s threatened species than previously thought. A new study suggests that nearly half of the mammals and a quarter of the birds on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s “red list” have already become victims of a shifting climate. The research, published this week in the journal Nature Climate Change, concludes that scientists and wildlife conservationists have failed to account for the damage inflicted by global warming. “Our results clearly show that the impact of climate change on mammals and birds to date is currently greatly under-estimated and reported upon,” co-author James Watson, of the Wildlife Conservation Society and the University of Queensland in Australia, said in a statement. “We need to greatly improve assessments of the impacts of climate change on species right now, we need to communicate this to the wider public and we need to ensure key decision-makers know that something significant needs to happen now to stop species going extinct. “Climate change is not a future threat anymore.” The authors, part of an international team of academics and conservationists, reviewed 130 previous studies on nearly 700 bird and mammal species and chronicled whether climate change had harmed, benefited or had no discernible effect on the creatures. They then identified characteristics that appeared to make species more vulnerable to climate change and extrapolated their findings to all the birds and mammals listed as threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. According to their analysis, climate change has likely already harmed 47 percent of terrestrial mammals and 23 percent of birds listed. The IUCN lists climate change as a threat to only 7 percent of those mammals and 4 percent of the birds. The review found that mammals that burrow into the earth, for example, can protect themselves from extreme heat and tend to be more resilient. Rodents and insectivores on the list seem to have benefited more than they’ve been harmed. But members of nine other orders of mammals have not fared so well. Primates, marsupials and elephants have likely been hit hard by climate change, the authors wrote. They live primarily in tropical or sub-tropical zones, meaning they’ve evolved within a narrow range of temperatures. Primates’ and elephants’ slow reproductive rates also make it harder for them to adapt to rapid environmental changes. Among birds, species living at high altitudes are particularly at risk. Aquatic birds and those inhabiting tropical forests are also more likely to be harmed, with their habitats particularly threatened by fragmentation. The authors noted several uncertainties and limitations to their work. Animals in Europe and North America were studied far more than those on other continents, so the findings “might be less generalizable” to creatures in Africa, Asia and South America. “Despite these uncertainties, our results suggest that the impact of climate change on mammals and birds in the recent past is currently greatly underappreciated,” the paper said. “We recommend that research and conservation efforts give greater attention to the ‘here and now’ of climate change impacts on life on Earth.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "Retired and former employees of the Environmental Protection Agency are banding together in rare activism to defend colleagues still working for the agency, as fears of deep layoffs, regulatory rollbacks and science suppression spread through the federal ranks. Though organizing is still in its early stages, they’re holding protest rallies, looking to nurture agency whistleblowers and pushing senators to vote against President Donald Trump‘s EPA administrator nominee, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Having vehement opponents of regulation and deniers of mainstream climate change science as president and administrator of the EPA propelled them into a type of activism most had never embraced, former EPA employees said. “I’ve never experienced this kind of outcry in the past,” John J. O’Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238 in Chicago, said of the retirees’ involvement. The EPA has about 4,800 staff in its Washington D.C. headquarters and 11,000 nationally, including in 10 regional offices. Networks of former employees from EPA Region 1 in New England, Region 6 in the Southwest, Region 9 in California and Region 10 in the Northwest have contacted the watchdog group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) to confer about the best ways to advocate for current EPA workers, said PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch. Staff and former employees from Region 5 in Chicago recently staged a public protest in Federal Plaza during their lunch hour against threats of enormous staff cuts floated by an early leader of the Trump transition team, Myron Ebell. And more than 400 former employees signed an open letter to the Senate urging the rejection of Pruitt. Region 8, headquartered in Denver, has arguably the most active group of retirees. Six weeks ago, 20 of them met in a city bar during a snowstorm, discussing effective tactics against Pruitt’s nomination. About 80 of them rallied in front of the EPA in downtown Denver in mid-January before going to the offices of Colorado Sens. Michael Bennet, a Democrat, and Cory Gardner, a Republican, to meet with staff and submit letters protesting the choice of Pruitt. Now with 90 members and growing, the Region 8 group, called Save EPA!, is building its public advocacy efforts, reaching out to current employees and finding ways to be a safe conduit for whistleblowers to expose wrongdoing. “We want to show people they don’t have to give up and that we have their back,” said Suzanne Wuerthele, a toxicologist who worked for 23 years in Region 8. “They can leak information to us. We can find ways to blunt the damage from what the new administration does. This is an opportunity to reinforce EPA’s values.” Trump’s nomination of Pruitt ignited fears that the president would deliver on his campaign pledge to gut the EPA. The Oklahoma attorney general has a record of routinely suing the regulator and backing the fossil fuel industry, which has helped finance his political career. In late January, Ebell, a leader in climate denial campaigns who briefly helmed the EPA transition team, told the media that he expected Trump to slash EPA staff by one-half to two-thirds. That would take the agency to the staffing levels of the early",

    "content": "Many of President Donald Trump’s words and actions have federal scientists worried their work will be politicized or suppressed. Now, one advocacy group is responding with a step-by-step guide for scientists to securely share information about any foul play. The Union of Concerned Scientists, whose mission is to protect scientific integrity, has created a webpage for federal scientists to report abuses, with instructions on how to avoid detection or hacking. Trump has called climate change a hoax, and one of his administration’s first moves was to remove pages from the White House and State Department websites that referred to the issue. The Trump administration has sent memos and directives to agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Park Service, that some employees reportedly interpreted as gag orders, though some of the directives were later reversed or disavowed. “There have been a number of actions either proposed or taken by the transition team and the administration that make science more vulnerable to political interference,” said Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He said many of Trump’s nominees are opposed to the missions of the agencies they would oversee. “When you have hostile agency appointees, science becomes more vulnerable to political influence. So I think all these conditions taken together make it more important for federal employees to report what they see.” Some scientists have considered Trump’s actions as an assault on the profession and have begun reexamining their traditionally quiet political role. Hundreds of academics signed an open letter to Trump calling for action on climate change, and others are planning a march on Washington in April. Fearing regulatory rollbacks and science suppression, retired and former employees of the EPA are banding together in rare activism to defend colleagues still working for the agency and nurture whistleblowers, InsideClimate News reported. On Tuesday, Republicans on the House Science Committee asked the EPA’s  to look at reports that agency employees were using the encrypted messaging app Signal to communicate with each other. The app is among the methods that the Union of Concerned Scientists recommends using to communicate securely. Even before Trump took office, scientists began copying federal datasets they feared might be removed from public access. UCS’s new webpage encourages federal employees to “share any evidence of actions that impede the ability of science or scientists to protect public health and the environment,” including memos, emails or “datasets or other information that has been altered or removed from public view.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2017-02-13T18:17:11-05:00",
    "content": "Heat waves are hitting the globe from north to south, with the Arctic, parts of Australia and the central United States sweating record warmth in recent days. The Arctic is in the midst of another hot spell, with temperatures soaring far above average for the third time this winter. The heat comes after yet another record-breaking month for low levels of sea ice at the North Pole, part of a dramatic and troubling warming trend that scientists have reported over the past few months. In Oklahoma and Texas, temperatures reached into the 90s over the weekend. Mangum, Okla. broke a daily record when the thermometer hit 99 degrees on Saturday.Last week, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin issued an emergency burn ban in response to the extreme weather, but a grass fire broke out anyway in Oklahoma City, prompting authorities to ask some residents to leave their homes. Parts of southeastern Australia are also in the midst of an extreme heat wave, with temperatures topping 115 degrees on Saturday west of Sydney. The heat has helped fuel dozens of bush fires that are forcing evacuations. Authorities have said the fire conditions are as bad as they have seen. For climate scientists, the relative warmth in the Arctic is arguably the most troubling. Temperatures in the far north of the planet have risen more than 20 degrees above normal on average in the past week, according to data from the Danish Meteorological Institute. Last week, the National Snow and Ice Data Center announced that the polar ice cap in January stood at a record low for the 38 years it has collected satellite data. Compared to a year earlier, which set the previous record for the smallest January ice cap, the North Pole had lost a Wyoming-sized area of ice. “I’ve been looking at Arctic weather and climate for 35 years and I’ve never seen anything like the warming conditions we’ve been seeing this winter,” said Mark Serreze, the center’s director. Some scientists believe that climate change is exacerbating weather patterns that allow storms to bring warm air north. The melting ice cap may be playing an important role, scientists say. Patches of open ocean act like reservoirs of heat, pushing the warmth farther north. Water also absorbs far more heat than ice, creating a warming feedback loop. In December, NOAA released its annual Arctic Report Card, which warned that if the extreme warming of recent years continues, the region could experience a climatic shift. The Arctic is warming at twice the global average, and mean temperatures over land have risen 3.5 degrees Celsius since the beginning of the 20th century. The dramatic warming has prompted seemingly outlandish proposals from some scientists. Last month, researchers published an article that envisioned an array of wind-powered pumps that would bring seawater from below up onto the ice surface, where it would freeze and thicken the ice cap. An extra several feet of ice, the scientists say, would help the polar cap withstand the warmer temperatures that have been shrinking it to record levels. The authors also put a price tag on their proposal: $500 billion per year. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Republican Carbon Tax Proposal: Novel Climate Solution or Regulatory Giveaway?",
    "date": "2017-02-09T09:00:20-05:00",
    "content": "A group of eminent establishment Republicans have proposed a grand compromise on climate change policy: a carbon tax, offset by a payout to individuals and families, in exchange for repeal of other regulations on industry. The tax, collecting $40 for every ton of carbon dioxide pollution from fossil fuels, and escalating over time, would include a charge on imports and would generate enough revenue to pay substantial, regular dividend checks to individuals and households. In exchange, Congress would strip the Environmental Protection Agency of most powers to issue new regulations to control emissions, including a full repeal of the Clean Power Plan that the Obama administration wrote to govern power plants. The proponents say their approach is designed to create deeper emissions cuts than regulations would accomplish, more than enough to meet the United States’ pledges under the Paris Agreement on global warming. Among others, its sponsors include five prominent cabinet members and economic advisers to past Republican presidents—George Shultz, James Baker, Henry Paulsen, Martin Feldstein and Gregory Mankiw. It’s a longshot to become law, but it won guarded praise from some environmentalists. If this version of the idea does draw more serious attention than past trial balloons, here are the kinds of vexingly complicated questions that will surely arise. For starters, prices would go up, for everything from gasoline and electricity, to stuff made of metal and cement, to food and other staples. That’s deliberate: a carbon tax, like a cattle prod, is meant to deliver a shock that changes behavior. It’s fairly simple to calculate the impact on gas at the pump—about 36 cents a gallon, at first. It gets much harder to estimate the ripple effects. How your electric company or the conglomerate that sells you breakfast cereal responds to rising fuel prices is up to them, but the costs will come back to you. Under this plan, all the tax revenues are intended to go back to consumers in quarterly checks from the Social Security system—an estimated $2,000 yearly for a family of four. This could help people who are already having a hard time making ends meet, but they’d still notice the extra cost of every fill-up. Theoretically, people will react to these price signals by conserving energy, whether that means carpooling and lowering the thermostat, squeezing into a thrifty hatchback or splurging on an elegant Tesla. Realistically, adjusting your carbon footprint is not always as simple as it sounds. What if you live in a rental apartment, or face a sudden increase in your bus fare to work? You can’t install double-paned windows or switch buses, so you might just cut spending on premium cable channels or do something else with no carbon benefit. And if the merits of this plan are its simplicity, as its sponsors boast, even they are tempted to gild the lily. “Congress might even consider allowing individuals to borrow against their future dividend income for certain clearly defined purposes, such as higher education or the purchase of an electric vehicle,” the proposal suggests. The idea of trading off a carbon tax against traditional regulations is the main thing that distinguishes this proposal from a half dozen carbon tax bills presented by Democrats—such as Bernie Sanders, who combined a smaller carbon tax with a larger package of regulations and incentives. The rollback is done mainly to defang corporate opposition. The carbon tax will punish the sickly coal industry especially hard, as it’s the dirtiest fuel. That’s why the first rule to go, under this proposal, would be the Clean Power Plan, anathema to Big Coal. But fossil fuel industries already believe that the CPP is dead in the water, ripe to be overturned in court or gutted by President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Scott Pruitt, who sued to block the plan and is now nominated to head the EPA. And environmentalists, even those who would normally welcome a tax on carbon and who recognize that utility emissions had been dropping fast even without the CPP, won’t easily accept this tradeoff. It’s not just the CPP, but the entire authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to limit CO2 under the Clean Air Act, that could be sold down the river. Perhaps existing energy-efficiency standards for autos might survive, but not much else. To some green campaigners, this sounds like: “Here’s a silver bullet. Now surrender your firearms.” The approach suggested by this group starts with a tax of $40 per ton of and increases it gradually. But how far? The authors of this proposal suggested: “At the completion of a five year period, a Blue Ribbon Panel could recommend whether the tax rate should increase further, based on the best climate science available at the time.” But blue ribbons are no match for political buzzsaws, and in this case the science is already under assault from forces of denial. Even these moderate Republicans, who never cracked down on carbon when they were in power, are a little dodgy on the science, declaring that “while the extent to which climate change is due to man-made causes can be questioned, the risks associated with future warming are too big and should be hedged.” Scientists say that to head off the worst risks of global warming, carbon pollution from energy has to be brought to zero in a few decades. That implies a pretty stiff tax, escalating at a pretty rapid clip. Some economists say that a carbon tax should be roughly in line with the costs that society will have to pay for damages from the warming caused by today’s emissions. This is known as the “social cost of carbon” and has been estimated by the Obama administration to be in the ballpark of $40. But fossil fuel allies in Congress are hostile to using the measure for any regulatory purpose whatsoever, let alone to fix a price directly on carbon dioxide emissions. It’s not clear what a carbon tax would mean for the growing practice in some states and around the world of putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade policies. The Senate gave up on this approach early in the Obama administration, after the House had passed a cap and trade bill. Cap and trade has proven to be popular and effective in the Northeast, where states banded together to create the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. It caps utility emissions and shares the revenues with the states, who use the money for energy efficiency and other programs. But when Congressional opponents killed the idea nationally, it was by dubbing it “cap-and-tax.” That doesn’t bode well for this alternative, even if the tax is sweetened by a dividend. The possibilities are endless. If the goal is to level the playing field between competing forms of energy, why not strip away tax subsidies that favor oil, natural gas and coal on the one hand, or wind and solar on the other? A $40 tax on carbon is a lot, but it’s not nearly enough to make carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), favored by many in the fossil fuel industry, competitive in the marketplace. What would Congress be likelier to do: raise the tax to make CCS feasible, or write a loophole for this special case? If a quarterly dividend check from the Social Security office would draw support from consumers, why not use some of the money to lower corporate taxes instead? If Congress is going to be effectively increasing the gas tax, why not invest some of this tax increase in the way gas taxes have always been spent—on highways and mass transit infrastructure? Roads and bridges are crumbling as the trust fund withered away, partly because drivers of fuel-efficient cars paid less taxes. Infrastructure advocates will surely want a piece of the carbon tax action. If it’s carbon that counts, how to calculate the carbon footprint of ethanol derived from corn and other plants? How about the carbon footprint of wood pellets burned to make electricity? Just applying the carbon tax to biofuels is a whole battleground of its own.

    "date": "2017-02-04T11:00:35-05:00",
    "content": "Researchers have developed a new method for determining the source of black carbon—a particularly nasty type of pollution that can blanket the Arctic—giving some hope that this known accelerator of climate change could be slowed. Black carbon, the soot that darkens the sea ice, causing it to absorb heat from the sun instead of reflecting it, speeds up the rate at which the ice disappears. It’s yet another severe aspect of climate change—except that its lifespan is just days or weeks, as opposed to carbon dioxide’s, which can last a century or more. That means that finding its source and mitigating its effects can have an almost immediate impact, and might hold a key for helping slow the rapid melting of the Arctic. A new study, released earlier this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides “a very powerful tool” in combating black carbon, said Scripps Institution of Oceanography atmospheric scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan, who was not a part of the study. “It’s a new tool for understanding who is emitting what and when,” he said. Black carbon can travel thousands of miles from where it is initially emitted, so finding the source of the pollution can make it more feasible for policymakers to attempt to stop it. The authors of the study gathered two years of black carbon data from eastern Siberia—a remote, sparsely populated region—and developed the method for determining the source. By analyzing the isotopes of the black carbon samples, the authors determined that black carbon in the region was coming primarily from transportation and home heating with coal or biomass. The isotope analysis was then compared with data from observation-based models and inventories of known emissions of black carbon. When they began the study, the authors had expected the biggest sources of black carbon would be gas flaring and power plants. “The results related to gas flaring were probably the biggest surprise,” said author Patrik Winiger, an applied environmental scientist at Stockholm University. Instead, they saw that vehicles and residential sources were the main offenders, often coming all of the way from China, elsewhere in Russia and Europe. Winiger worked on the project from Sweden, while local technicians in Tiksi, Russia sent data at regular intervals. This coordination was a key element in the study, as bringing samples across borders can pose problems for traveling scientists, Winiger said. Winiger and his colleagues analyzed the isotopes that made up each sample, each of which look different depending on the source. “Given that we have precise isotopic fingerprints, we can tell you exactly how much carbon is coming from where,” Winiger said. One of the most novel elements of the study is that the authors had data out of that region at all. Siberia makes up nearly half of the Arctic region, and yet it is rare to have observations and data from there. Climate experts from the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization have determined that black carbon, a short-lived climate pollutant, is 100 to 2,000 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. As the new study’s authors show, the soot can travel long distances, landing in the Arctic and exacerbating an already dire climate situation there. The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and the past year in particular has been marked by record-breaking high temperatures and low levels of sea ice. As the sea ice melts, it exposes the dark ocean below. Instead of radiating some of the sun’s rays back into the atmosphere, the way the white surface of sea ice can, the ocean absorbs the sun’s heat, warming the planet more. Black carbon adds a secondary element to that process. When the soot covers the ice, it darkens the surface, absorbing more heat from the sun. It also speeds up the melting of snow. Though scientists agree any global mitigation efforts have to center on immediately and drastically lowering carbon dioxide emissions, those changes have been politically difficult, opposed by powerful forces and may not happen in time to save the Arctic. But at least theoretically, slowing black carbon could offer some hope. Knowing the source can help policymakers target their efforts more quickly and efficiently, if there’s political will for it. The next step, the authors say, will be analyzing other parts of the world. Winiger is currently working on a similar project with samples from Alert, Canada, the northernmost station in the world.

    "date": "2017-02-01T18:50:51-05:00",
    "content": "For environmentalists worried about future Supreme Court decisions on climate change, the biggest difference between Donald Trump’s nominee to the court and Barack Obama’s boils down to one word, Chevron. Neil Gorsuch, chosen by Trump to fill the vacancy of Antonin Scalia, is seen as a steadfast foe of the Chevron standard. That principle says courts should defer to federal regulatory agencies when the regulators are carrying out laws that are ambiguous. In contrast to Gorsuch, Merrick Garland, nominated last year by Obama but stymied by Senate Republicans, adhered closely to the standard. Chevron is one of the pillars of modern regulatory law, and it matters greatly to climate change activists because it has provided the Environmental Protection Agency considerable leeway in using the Clean Air Act to control carbon dioxide pollution. Its significance will be stark when the Supreme Court considers the fate of the Clean Power Plan in the next year or so. The rule is a pillar of Obama’s climate policies, but Trump has vowed to discard it. Just before Scalia died, the Supreme Court put it on hold and a federal appeals court is reviewing it. It’s the next big test of the Chevron doctrine. Ever since a Democratic-controlled Congress failed to pass a climate bill early in Obama’s presidency, attempts to regulate emissions have hinged on the executive branch’s interpretations of existing law. That would be a lot easier to do with Chevron in place than without it. Chevron is the main reason that climate hawks reacted as they did to the Gorsuch nomination. “A review of Gorsuch’s writings and decisions indicate that he would seek to overturn well-established Supreme Court precedents and prevent the federal government from enforcing bedrock environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act,” said EarthJustice, the green litigation group. The Center for American Progress, which supported Obama’s policies, warned: “Gorsuch wants to give unelected judges more power to strike down federal regulations that protect consumers and the environment.” It’s a fair, if somewhat simplistic, interpretation of his record. In one widely noted opinion on an immigration case, Gorsuch wrote that the Chevron standard “certainly seems to have added prodigious new powers to an already titanic administrative state.” One remarkable thing about Gorsuch’s view is that it doesn’t just rebalance power away from the executive branch and back to the legislative branch. Congressional Republicans, already on an anti-regulatory spree, would cheer that. Rather, it shifts the ultimate power of interpretation to the judicial branch. Gorsuch calls Chevron an “abdication of judicial duty.” And that duty is to “interpret the law and declare invalid agency actions inconsistent with those interpretations.” That only heightens the panic of environmentalists who, having lost control of both chambers of Congress and of the White House in less than a decade, fear losing out in the Supreme Court. But while they are right to worry, the balancing act around Chevron and other principles of environmental law is tricky, and advocates defending climate action are not facing a lost cause. Here are just a few things to remember about Chevron. It doesn’t always favor environmentalists. In fact, the",

    "date": "2017-01-30T15:57:48-05:00",
    "content": "Among the fuzzy pledges President Trump has made in his energy plans, his idea to pay for a $1 trillion public infrastructure program with a bonanza of fossil fuel mining and drilling revenue stands out as particularly far-fetched. It’s a promise that is central to his economic agenda, intended to attract support for a fossil-fuel spree among those who favor investments in modernizing roads, bridges, bike paths and the electric grid. Drilling revenue is reaped primarily by the fossil fuel companies, and siphoning it into public works projects would require a series of implausible events. “I would be very careful making financial commitments based on a promise that increased energy supply would lead to increased government revenue,” said Mark Haggerty, an economist at Headwaters Economics, a nonpartisan research center in Bozeman, Mont. “These royalties are volatile, and that has little to do with regulation, and everything to do with the market.” Neither the Trump administration nor members of his energy transition team responded to requests for comment. Details are sparse in Trump’s “An America First Energy Plan,” a retread of campaign talking points published by the White House on inauguration day. (It says only, “We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure.”) The controversial idea was plucked from the energy industry’s wish list for rolling back regulations and opening up more public lands to drilling. The American Petroleum Institute (API), the industry’s top lobbying group that has vigorously fought the Obama administration’s climate agenda and pollution rules, released a study in",

    "date": "2017-01-19T18:00:47-05:00",
    "content": "While some research has linked the spread of Lyme disease to climate change, the details of that connection are complex. A new study suggests that a warming world may help tamp down the disease at the southern edge of the Northeastern coastal region where it is most prevalent. The research, published last week in the journal PLOS ONE, suggests that a warmer climate in the Southeastern United States has led to the evolution of deer ticks that are less likely to latch onto people, at least in some parts of the ticks’ range. Other research has shown that climate change appears to be expanding the ticks’ overall range, and that global warming may help spread many dangerous mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and Zika into new areas. Scientists have known for years that Lyme is less common in the South, despite widespread prevalence of the parasite that causes it. A couple of years ago, some of the same researchers involved in the new work confirmed that southern ticks tend to bed down below the leaf litter, while their northern counterparts prefer climbing up stalks of grass or brush, primed to hitch a ride on human legs. The findings were revealing but baffling, said Howard Ginsberg, a research ecologist with the United States Geological Survey and the lead author of the new study. “No one understood why.” To answer the question, Ginsberg and colleagues took larvae from two populations of ticks—one from Rhode Island and one a cross-breed of northern and southern groups—and exposed them to different climatic conditions in a lab. The researchers discovered that when humidity dropped below about 85 percent, ticks tended to die quickly under hotter, southern temperatures. If humidity remained higher, however, as it generally does deep under a blanket of leaves, ticks were able to survive the heat. With consistent exposure to high temperatures, the authors surmise, the southern populations have evolved with the instinct to lay low. Ginsberg says the findings suggest that as temperatures warm, ticks in some regions of the Mid-Atlantic, like the Chesapeake Bay, may evolve to exhibit similar behaviors, perhaps leading to lower incidence of Lyme there. Sam Telford, an epidemiologist at Tufts University, said the work was very good and serves to confirm what decades of observations suggested about differing behaviors between northern and southern deer ticks. But he suspects that other genetic differences between the populations, which scientists are just beginning to explore, may also contribute to the disparate rates of Lyme infections. The disease has become the most common illness spread by pests in Europe and North America. Each year, an estimated 300,000 Americans contract Lyme—which can cause rashes, swollen joints and neurological problems—and the number of cases reported has risen steadily over the past 25 years. That has invited lots of attention from scientists and the public, including extensive discussion in last year’s National Climate and Health Assessment. In a synthesis of existing research, the assessment stressed the enormous challenges to untangling the relationship between Lyme and climate change. Warmer weather can affect every aspect of the disease’s cycle, from the abundance of ticks and host animals to the behavior of the bacterium itself, Borrelia burgdorferi. It noted that studies have established an influence of climate on the distribution of ticks, but that a direct link between temperature and incidence of Lyme has proven more elusive. Ginsberg is quick to stress that their findings remain theoretical. There are other possible explanations for the lower incidence of Lyme in the South, including the different mix of vertebrate hosts. Skinks and other lizards, which are common in the South, are relatively poor vessels for the disease compared with mice. Ginsberg and his colleagues have been testing this hypothesis as well and expect to publish their results in coming years. Maria Diuk-Wasser, who studies the effects of environmental change on tick-borne illnesses at Columbia University, said in an email that the study provides “a significant contribution to the field,” because it links tick mortality to specific measurements. But she stressed that our understanding of the evolution of tick behavior “is still in its infancy, so it would be hard to predict how the ticks will evolve to changes in climate.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "Among Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees awaiting Senate confirmation, few are expected to face tougher scrutiny than Scott Pruitt, the president-elect’s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The Oklahoma attorney general is a relentless adversary of that agency and its regulations, and he has deep ties to the fossil fuel industry he would be charged with overseeing. In five years as chief law enforcer for his energy-rich state, Pruitt has transformed his office into a regiment in the war against federal regulation of industry. He has been a party to at least 14 lawsuits challenging the EPA’s authority to impose rules on oil and gas production, vehicles and coal-fired electricity, helping to lead the campaign against President Barack Obama‘s signature climate initiative, the Clean Power Plan. Pruitt will face tough questions, mostly from Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the panel weighing his nomination on Wednesday, on whether the fossil fuel industry’s generous support for his political career would compromise his leadership of the EPA. Among the evidence to that end: While opponents of Pruitt face an uphill battle, Democrats on the Senate environmental panel have made clear their plan to hit the nominee hard with questions on conflicts of interest. They sent letters last week to the Office of Government Ethics and the EPA’s chief ethics officer requesting opinions on Pruitt’s obligations to disclose hidden funders to the nonprofit he led. They also asked about ethics issues raised by his litigation in cases joined by industry groups from whom he has solicited money. The stakes over Pruitt’s nomination are high for environmental advocates and their Democratic allies. They fear the Trump administration will embark on an historic rollback of 40 years of federal protections for air, water and land, as well as dismantling the first federal limits on global warming emissions. Neither Pruitt’s counsel nor the Trump transition team responded to queries on the conflict of interest questions.

    "date": "2017-01-06T13:00:44-05:00",
    "content": "With abundant new technology, slowing demand for energy and an ample supply, the United States appears nearly ready to export as much energy as it imports. In its Annual Energy Outlook published Thursday, the Department of Energy’s statistical office declared that in most of the scenarios it examined, the nation will soon become a net exporter of energy. If that trade balance were the only measure of President Barack Obama’s energy legacy, then he might declare victory and go home. But the picture portrayed in the the Energy Information Administration’s 127-page report is more complex than that—and full of mixed messages, especially when it comes to climate change impacts. The outlook is made murkier by the political uncertainties as Donald Trump moves into the Oval Office. Republicans in Congress are set to conduct a broad assault on energy and climate laws and regulations, as well as the Paris climate agreement. The EIA’s reference case operates on the assumption that no policies will change. And that’s unlikely at this moment of upheaval. “One of the things that EIA administrators have learned over the years is that it is bad enough to have to forecast oil prices or natural gas prices or anything else, but when you go in and say, ‘We think Congress is going to do this,’ that’s guaranteed to get your resignation accepted,” said Adam Sieminski, who is himself about to retire from the job, as he presented a two-hour briefing on the new outlook. In general, it shows that whatever progress is being made in reducing climate impacts through carbon pollution—and there has been quite a bit—there is still a long way to go. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, in one of the cabinet “exit memos” released by the White House on Thursday, said that “progress in advanced clean energy technology, sharply dropping costs, and increased deployment” were all pointing toward meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. “Yet, our analysis indicates that these advancements will not be enough to avert the worst effects of climate change,” he said. This would require “deep decarbonization” across the economy, driven by doubling spending on green energy research and a price on carbon. Both are in jeopardy, judging by the agenda shaping up under Republican control. In her exit memo, Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, wrote of a similar yearning to not just carry out the Clean Power Plan but to expand on it. “As the world changes and evolves, we must be prepared to participate in future conversations about carbon markets and emissions trading programs,” she wrote. “Both represent a tremendous opportunity for economic growth.” Nothing of the kind is projected by the EIA’s model-driven outlook. It doesn’t contemplate what the energy landscape would look like in a scenario bounded by the demands of the Paris Agreement, which seeks a zero-carbon-emissions world later in this century. ExxonMobil Corporation, too, has just released its own energy outlook for the next few decades. As in the past, it predicts that fossil fuels will continue to provide a big majority of growing energy demand, with the result that emissions peak in",

Now the question is whether the downturn is just a blip or is the start of a trend away from the expensive and carbon-intensive fuel. If enacted, the policies would implement the most stringent limits on the industry to date and send a signal that energy companies must balance development of the oil sands with climate action. “This has been one of the most difficult years for us,” said Ben Brunnen, vice president of oil sands for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. “In addition to the investment climate, we are seeing some pretty substantial federal and provincial policies.” Since oil prices tanked in",

    "date": "2016-12-21T16:53:30-05:00",
    "content": "There are warning signs that some forests in the western U.S. may have a hard time recovering from the large and intense wildfires that have become more common as the climate warms. After studying 14 burned areas across 10 national forests in California, scientists from UC Davis and the U.S. Forest Service said recent fires have killed so many mature, seed-producing trees across such large areas that the forests can’t re-seed themselves. And because of increasingly warm temperatures, burned areas are quickly overgrown by shrubs, which can prevent trees from taking root. “With high-severity fires, the seed source drops off,” said study co-author Kevin Lynch, a forest researcher at UC Davis. “We aren’t seeing the conditions that are likely to promote natural regeneration.” Historically, severe fires were uncommon in the forests covered by the study, largely made up of yellow pines and mixed conifers, but extended drought and heatwaves have exacerbated fire conditions across the West. The changing climate is also seen as a factor in recent wildfires in the Southeast, which is also mired in drought. For the study, published Wednesday in the journal Ecosphere, the researchers surveyed 1,500 plots in burned areas at different elevations in the Sierra Nevadas, Klamath Mountains, and North Coast regions. There was no natural conifer regeneration at all in 43 percent of the plots, they reported. “[O]ur data support growing concern that the well-documented trend toward larger and more severe fires is a major threat to conifer forest sustainability in our study region,” the authors wrote. They said the study results could apply to mixed conifer forests across the West. Welch said the study was aimed at helping forest managers decide where to apply limited funding to replant forests that aren’t regrowing on their own. “There aren’t enough of the right kind of trees growing back, the sugar pines and the ponderosa pines,” he said, describing the native species that are ecologically and commercially valuable. Firs and cedars dominated in the study plots where there was regeneration, but those trees are much less resistant to future fires. Decades of logging of old fire-resistant trees and fire suppression shifted the composition of the forests, making them more dense. Add in the drying and warming climate, and it’s a recipe for intense fires. “Pretty much everyone agrees that’s the climate change signal,” he said. That meshes with findings in other recent studies, said Ellis Margolis and Collin Haffey, U.S. Geological Survey forest scientists in New Mexico who were not involved in the new study. “The story from recent fires is that, due to a warming and drying climate, combined with increased fuels from a century of fire exclusion, high-severity burn patches in dry conifer forests have been increasing in size,” they said in an email response. “Importantly, some of these large, severe burn patches have no surviving trees within them.” Some areas are being scorched repeatedly because wildfires are also becoming more frequent. Those re-burns have killed off even more of the mature seed trees. “The loss of seed sources and increasing moisture stress after fires, both related to climate change, does not bode well for the future of large areas of dry conifer forests,” they said.

    "content": "As the nation heads toward a Donald Trump presidency, environmental advocates and their political allies are grappling with a presence set to loom large in the nation’s policy-making. It’s a set of viewpoints that had been teetering on the edge of irrelevance under President Obama: the resurgent climate denial movement. Over the last month, that viewpoint not only rushed back into the mainstream, it threatens to dominate Trump’s cabinet. He has filled his transition team and top energy and environment posts (among others) with a litany of climate science denialists who oppose government action on global warming, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (Department of Energy), Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (Environmental Protection Agency), and Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke (Department of Interior). Trump’s team so far includes people with such extreme anti-climate views that by comparison, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, is being hailed by some as a beacon of hope for climate action. Tillerson, speaking for Exxon, has voiced acceptance of climate change, making him one of the only Trump cabinet nominees accepting the consensus of 97 percent of the world’s scientists. Still, his company is under investigation for misleading investors during its long history of opposing climate action. The remarkable reversal of fortune for the denialists comes only a year after what must have seemed like their nadir: the landmark Paris agreement, when nearly 200 nations including the United States committed to a zero-carbon future. “We are winning, and a couple of years ago, it didn’t seem possible,” said Brooke Rollins, a Trump adviser and chief of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. She spoke on the sidelines of the group’s energy and climate policy summit last week, a conference in Washington D.C. hosted by its sister think tank, the Heritage Foundation. About 250 attendees listened to the most prominent deniers in Congress and included coal barons and other fossil fuel industry backers and a who’s who of Trump’s energy and economic advisers. “For the first time, we have a partner in the White House who understands,” Rep. Lamar Smith, (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, told the group. The gathering had a decidedly celebratory feel. “Most people thought it was going to be a really sad and dark and unfortunate time for the country especially on this issue,” said Rollins, who was previously Perry’s policy director. “Here we are,” she said. “There is great hope.” Organized climate denial stretches back to the early",

    "content": "Hundreds of species around the world—plants, animals, marine life—are experiencing local extinctions due to climate change, according to a new study. Researchers say it’s likely to be just the beginning. As the climate warms, these species, which range from types of chipmunks to grasses to sea snails, are no longer showing up in the places they used to call home. The phenomenon isn’t isolated to one particular geographical region or temperature zone, the study found. Of the 976 species analyzed in the study, which was published Thursday in the journal PLoS Biology, nearly 50 percent have already become extinct along the “warm edge” of their range. It’s a reflection of a known process, by which species are moving poleward and to higher altitudes to escape changes to their habitats as the climate warms. The study’s author, John J. Wiens, said local extinctions are inherent in range shifts. The species being impacted can’t exactly say, “‘Oh, it’s too hot here, I’m heading north,’” said Wiens, who is an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. The species have three choices: Adapt to the changing temperature, emigrate or die. Wiens analyzed other research that assessed range shifts for other species, looking for patterns. What he found surprised him. “The overall striking pattern is how similar it is,” he said, pointing out that it’s not just 50 percent of tropical amphibians, or 50 percent of temperate marine species that are going locally extinct. “It’s about 50 percent all over the world and for all these different groups of organisms.” Read More: ICN’s series Species on the Move Since",

    "date": "2016-12-12T13:00:32-05:00",
    "content": "ROCKY HILL, Conn.—Bryan Garcia, president of the Connecticut Green Bank, said he knew five years ago when it was created that it would be an important model for funding clean energy projects. He didn’t know it might become critical for funding them. In the face of a Donald Trump presidency that dismisses climate change and threatens to ignore its solutions, the future of clean energy may rely heavily on new approaches like the ones pioneered by the Connecticut Green Bank, the first-ever statewide one. The bank’s mission is to leverage limited public money into even more private investment in clean energy so eventually there is no need for public money. That would create jobs, lower energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “The green bank model may be an attractive tool under a Trump presidency,” Garcia said. “Public-private partnerships like ours spur investment in local clean energy economies that create jobs and ultimately mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.” The Connecticut bank said it has surpassed $1 billion in money put in play—some for loans, other money for default security— with an average of $6 in private funding created from every $1 in public money. It has designed a dozen or more clean energy and efficiency financial products, programs and marketing efforts. Best known is its heralded Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, C-PACE, program that is transforming how commercial properties finance clean energy and energy efficiency improvements. The bank says it has created nearly 215 megawatts of clean power across more than 20,000 projects, the equivalent of nearly 13,000 jobs directly for clean energy companies and other businesses that benefit from clean energy, and saved more than 2.6 million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. Initially the private banking community saw the bank as competition, but has come around so much that two early popular programs are now run solely by private banks. Officials say several private companies have launched specifically because of opportunities created by the bank’s success. “Our goal is to be catalytic,” Garcia said. “These problems aren’t going to be solved by taxpayers and ratepayers. These problems are going to be solved by bringing more private investment into the clean energy economies.” “It’s exceeded all expectations,” said Reed Hundt, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Coalition for Green Capital. Hundt, a former commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission under President Bill Clinton, sits on the Connecticut Green Bank board of directors. The green bank idea was hatched by Hundt and Dan Esty, a Yale University professor specializing in business, law and the environment and a former EPA official, while both were working on President Obama’s transition team. Esty had long espoused the concept that clean energy and combating climate change could create new businesses and jobs. In",

    "content": "Scientists found that Greenland rocks now buried under 10,000 feet of ice were ice-free for long stretches during the past 1.4 million years, leading them to predict the Greenland Ice Sheet could melt more suddenly than previously believed. That could raise global sea level far beyond current projections over the next few centuries, including recent estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, according to a new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The research challenges the prevailing idea that the ice sheet remained relatively intact during the recent geological past, showing even the thickest ice had vanished during warm periods between ice ages. Columbia University paleoclimatologist Joerg Schaefer, who co-authored the study, said the findings show the Greenland Ice Sheet may be much less stable than scientists thought. “Over the last 15 years, it looked like we wouldn’t have to worry too much about the Greenland ice sheet melting too fast,” Schaefer said. “Most of the climate models treated it as a solid ice cube sitting on bedrock. With climate warming, it melts off the top, but it takes a long time. Compared to other ice sheets like West Antarctica, is looked pretty strong and resilient to warming.” New, direct samples of the bedrock pierced that belief. “These might be the most precious rocks since the moon rocks,” he said. “We got the huge privilege of working with these rocks, and cutting-edge isotopic tools, and the surface of Greenland gave us a very clear answer. Unfortunately, the answer is it was ice-free during an important period.” If the ice sheet had persisted across most of Greenland during those warm periods, there was hope that it could stay mostly intact despite the Earth’s thickening blanket of greenhouse gases. The new study suggests that, because it mostly melted, there’s little doubt the planet’s warming trajectory will melt the Greenland Ice Sheet in the centuries ahead. “We lost the Greenland Ice Sheet during periods of natural forcing, We lost it several times, so it’s not reasonable to believe we’ll keep that ice sheet in the future with human-caused global warming,” he said. The paper doesn’t project a specific timeline for melting, but the findings could have an effect in the coming century. The models currently used to project sea level rise indicate a stable ice sheet. But other factors, including accelerating glaciers or more water at the base of the ice, could push the ice sheet past a tipping point toward a rapid meltdown, Schaeffer said. Knowing how fast and how much the Greenland Ice Sheet melted under past climate change is crucial to knowing how much sea level will rise in coming decades from ongoing global warming. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average. “This opens up questions for ice sheet modelers like me, whether we are missing processes in the models we use to project the rate of sea level rise in the next century,” said Lauren Gregoire, who studies abrupt climate change at the University of Leeds School of Earth and Environment. “This is right in the middle of the ice sheet. If someone can convince me there was no ice there, it probably means there was not much ice left. That part is really robust and convincing,” she said, referring to the location where the bedrock was sampled. “It’s definitely relevant to what’s going to happen in the future, it’s going tell us the magnitude of sea level change we’re going to have in the future, but not how fast.” Analyzing the isotopes created from tiny particles bombarding Earth from space helped the scientists conclude that up to 90 percent of the ice sheet probably melted several times during that span. The study implies that Greenland was almost ice free for almost 25 percent of the second half of Quaternary, a 2.6 million year geological period marked by relatively regular ice age cycles. Other climate records suggest those ice-free periods were much shorter, said scientist Andrey Ganopolski, who studies ice age cycles at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Although a couple of centuries to a couple of millennia are the fastest meltdown scenarios, according to Florian Ziemen, a climate modeler with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, the new study’s findings could have implications on for the next 50 to 100 years. Along with raising sea level more quickly than anticipated, cold water from melting Greenland ice could affect Atlantic Ocean currents that regulate the climate in the Northern Hemisphere, he added. To better assess the timing and extent of the historic melting, the scientists say more samples are needed. A prototype of a new drill that can rapidly penetrate nearly two vertical miles of ice has already been built by a consortium of U.S. scientists, but there’s currently no funding for deployment. It is the type of science most at risk if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his pledge to cut funding for climate research. The rock sample is more than 20 years old, but only in the past year have scientists been able to accurately trace the radioactive beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 isotopes that stem from the interstellar debris crashing to Earth. The isotopes decay at known rates, so they can accurately show when the rocks were exposed to the atmosphere. Many parts of the world will be hard-pressed to adapt to the 3-4 feet of sea level rise projected for",

    "date": "2016-11-23T16:29:59-05:00",
    "content": "President Barack Obama issued 263 executive orders during his eight years in office, at least 35 of them dealing with climate change, energy or the environment. When President-elect Donald Trump takes office, revoking some of those executive orders could be among his first acts, because it can be done without Congress, by the simple stroke of a pen. “On the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue” canceling “every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama,” Trump said in his 100-day action plan. Trump has made it clear that among his top priorities is the unfettered development of America’s oil, gas and coal. He pledged to revive the coal industry, although its decline is largely due to market forces, to lift restrictions and moratoriums on energy production, and to rescind regulations that stand in the way of this future. This clearly has put rules like the Clean Power Plan and methane regulations on the chopping block, but beyond that his agenda is still unclear. “If you look at the substance of the Trump campaign, it was hard to know what specific policies he was referring to and what he was advocating,” said Gary Bass, who founded the former government watchdog group OMB Watch. “So, I don’t know what he’s going to do. I have no clue. I wonder if he does?” On executive orders, he has a lot of targets. The orders range from fighting climate change to making federal buildings greener to ensuring that climate change is taken into account on committees dealing with the economy and domestic policy. Some deal with climate change only tangentially, with a single mention of climate or a low-carbon future in an order that deals with other issues. Others take the issue head on. They include requirements for federal buildings to be built based on more rigorous flood risk data; the establishment of a National Ocean Policy that would protect and coordinate decisionmaking related to oceans and coasts; the creation of committees to help disaster restoration efforts on the Gulf Coast and around the Chesapeake Bay; and mandates for the federal fleet to use lower-emitting vehicles. (There are several that Trump is likely to keep, too, including one executive order established to mollify the pipeline industry and its Congressional backers during the fight over Keystone XL. That order expedites the regulatory process around oil and gas infrastructure and development projects.) While it is impossible to know exactly what Trump will do when he takes office, a week after the election the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) gave a window into his possible thinking, when it laid out a hit list of three climate policy-related executive orders that it wants immediately eliminated. The leader of Trump’s EPA transition team is Myron Ebell, CEI’s director for its Center for Energy and Environment. The executive orders identified by CEI all involve changing the way the federal government operates to deal with climate change: Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade This order, issued on March 19,",

From Kentucky and Tennessee across the Carolinas to Georgia and Virginia, the National Interagency Fire Center reports 15 large wildfires that had burned at least 155,000 acres as of Tuesday. Several fires have been burning since late October, and the big one in Tennessee is among four new large fires reported by the National Interagency Fire Center. Now being called the Chimney Top fire, it has destroyed hundreds of structures and for a time was threatening downtown Gatlinburg. The intense surge of fire activity came after weeks of drought and unusually warm temperatures across the region. The Tennessee fires have burned at least 15,000 acres in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation’s most visited national park, which was closed as of late Tuesday.

    "date": "2016-11-22T20:00:39-05:00",
    "content": "When Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, demanded to see documents from ExxonMobil’s accountants as part of his probe into the company’s record on climate change, he was after more than a dollars-and-cents perspective on the oil giant’s books. The accountants, PriceWaterhouseCooper, are also experts in climate-related risks faced by fossil fuel companies, including the risks that some of their assets might be stranded as governments impose restrictions on carbon emissions. For years, the accounting firm has advised the Carbon Disclosure Project, now known as CDP, New York’s lawyers noted in court papers. CDP, a British nonprofit, issues reports on how well participating companies, including Exxon, perform in regards to emissions and other climate-related issues. This week, the latest report by CDP gave Exxon, along with its rivals Chevron and Suncor, the worst rankings. All three companies operate in the Canadian tar sands, where many analysts say oil reserves are particularly at risk. Schneiderman wants to know what PWC has told Exxon about the risks, and whether that advice has been reflected in what the oil company tells its investors. In particular, he wants to know if the accounting firm has been telling Exxon the same thing it has been telling the Carbon Disclosure Project. “ExxonMobil performs below its peers in its emissions performance and wider climate governance and strategy considerations,” the project’s new report card, In the Pipeline, stated. The report said that this made Exxon and the other low-scoring oil companies “higher risk investments from a sustainability perspective,” given that the industry is “likely to be impacted by more stringent carbon regulations.” A CDP spokesperson said PWC had no input in the report. In a court filing, Schneiderman’s team asserts that “Exxon has had longstanding knowledge of the risks associated with climate change, including the risks posed to its business by climate change-related policies and regulations. Notwithstanding its apparent knowledge of climate change-related risks, Exxon appears to have downplayed those risks in public statements.” Schneiderman’s earlier subpoena seeking decades of Exxon’s work on climate change and carbon dioxide emissions has netted over 1.2 million pages of documents in the past year. But his subpoena of PriceWaterhouseCooper three months ago, while much more focused, has produced hardly any documents at all—about 97 as of mid-October, including some relating to PWC’s work for CDP. On October 26, a New York judge ordered quick compliance, rejecting Exxon’s claim that the work of its accountants was shielded under Texas law. The company said it would appeal; it’s represented by Theodore V. Wells Jr. of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, one of the nation’s most influential lawyers. Exasperated, Justice Barry R. Ostrager warned the company against dragging its feet. “It can’t be Christmas,” he said impatiently. The company’s bookkeeping is of immediate interest to investors, especially since Exxon warned that it might have to remove billions of barrels of tar sands reserves from its books to reflect current low oil prices. Writ large, the question of stranded fossil-fuel assets is of intense concern to financiers around the world. The investigations of Exxon by Schneiderman and other state attorneys general took off last year after InsideClimate News published an investigative series documenting the company’s early understanding of the risks of climate change to the planet and to its business—and how Exxon later funded campaigns questioning the science of climate change and the need for strong government action. Schneiderman’s scrutiny of PWC focuses on more recent years, since",

Presented below are our expectations for Trump’s Top Ten list—along with some evidence about how complicated it might be to achieve these objectives, even with a Congress led by Republicans. The application might need yet another environmental review, although the new administration might argue that this step is superfluous after many years of study. Expect environmentalists to argue that a lot has changed since the last review, notably a lowering of oil prices. This changes the calculation of how environmental impacts of tar sands production would be affected by the big pipeline. There’s been a lot of talk that a new public works bill might be one of the first ways that Trump leaves his mark.

    "date": "2016-11-14T16:00:58-05:00",
    "content": "The shocking upset victory of Donald Trump has crumbled the ground under the environmental movement in the U.S., just as that movement started to feel like it was entering a new era: Keystone XL had been defeated; carbon regulations on the nation’s power plants were launched; Atlantic drilling was halted; and most pivotally, the U.S. joined the landmark Paris climate agreement. Now, one election could end U.S. leadership on global warming, or even acknowledgment of the crisis. Keystone XL and Atlantic drilling are back on the table. The Clean Power Plan to cut power plant emissions could be finished. The Paris agreement is in peril. “I think that the very bad news is that it comes at just the wrong moment,” said Bill McKibben, founder of the climate activist group 350.org. “There was finally a little bit of momentum underway on clean energy, fossil fuel infrastructure, and so on, and that’s going to stop for a while. There’ll be more than a pothole. More like a ditch in the road.” The problem, he said, is that climate is not like most issues—urgent without seeming urgent to many people. “The clock is ticking all of the time,” McKibben said. “If you kill Obamacare, some people will suffer. But it doesn’t make it harder to put it back again some day. This is a moving target. You can’t put it back.” After the election, both houses of Congress remain in Republican control and can align with a Republican president to dismantle the environmental achievements of the Obama administration. Trump has said he will gut the environmental protections built up in the 46 years since the Clean Air Act’s passage. By filling a Supreme Court vacancy and other judicial appointments, Trump will put his mark on the courts, where environmentalists have successfully fought previous efforts to roll back protections. Trump’s agenda includes canceling the Paris agreement, stopping payments for UN climate programs and clean energy funding, repealing the Obama Clean Power Plan, abolishing the Environmental Protection Agency, lifting all moratoriums on oil and gas drilling and coal mining and rescinding regulations that hinder production of fossil fuels. Robert Wilson, a professor of geography at Syracuse University who has studied the environmental movement, said that climate activists face a profound change from trying to influence a president who, while not always on their side, could be persuaded. “There’s no sense that Trump has any sympathy for them whatsoever,” Wilson said. “So where does the climate movement go now, when the person in the Oval Office is not persuadable? That seems to be the fundamental change.” In the face of the election’s upheaval, both mainstream environmental organizations and grassroots groups expressed confidence that public opinion was on their side, and could be marshalled into a force to be reckoned with. “If Trump does try to undermine climate action,” said Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, “he will run headlong into an organized mass of people who will fight him in the court, in the states, in Congress, in the marketplace and in the streets.” The first chance for the movement to display its post-election resolve will be a nationwide protest Tuesday that had been planned before Trump’s victory: a rally in more than 100 cities in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s fight against the Dakota Access pipeline. At least 28 groups, including the Indigenous Environmental Network, Honor the Earth, 350.org, the Hip Hop Caucus, Sierra Club, and Natural Resources Defense Council are helping to organize the demonstration at offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has jurisdiction to permit the pipeline. With new urgency, the groups are calling for the Obama administration to act before it leaves office to withdraw permits needed for construction of the 1,172-mile Bakken oil conduit, which would cross the Missouri River a half-mile upstream from the tribe’s reservation. “Who knows if that will last past Jan. 20?” said McKibben. “But at the very least, he should establish the principle—that we’re done screwing over Native Americans. And then let Trump change that if he wants to, and dares. “Standing together with our allies, and brothers and sisters all over the world is going to be a major part of what the Trump years are going to be about, I have a feeling,” McKibben added. “And I think everyone will feel a little better getting together out in the streets to demonstrate we’re not going away anytime soon.” Protesters in Standing Rock have faced riot police. One fear is that law enforcement may feel even more emboldened to crack down on the tribe and its allies under President Trump. His rumored pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, posted a message on Twitter that protests “must be quelled.” McKibben calls the Dakota Access fight, “the point in miniature of the entire climate fight: that the most vulnerable people in the world are at the mercy of the fossil fuel industry—their water, their climate, their land.” Climate activists harnessed the power of such grassroots organizing around concrete energy industry impacts in the Keystone XL campaign. This was where the movement turned after two devastating failures: the fruitless effort for an international climate treaty at Copenhagen in",

    "content": "During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised cheering Rust Belt crowds that he would shutter the Environmental Protection Agency and roll back regulations. Now that he’s headed to the Oval Office, the environmental community is contemplating how Trump might make good on those promises. Some of them may prove to be campaign bluster. Some of them may not. “Trump sounds like he’s serious about scaling back much environmental regulation,” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change at the Columbia Law School. But dismantling the EPA, as Trump has threatened, is far more difficult than simply shooing it away. Government agencies like the EPA are established by law, and killing them requires the support of Congress. But Trump can attack some of the Obama administration’s signature rules, scaling back the agency’s reach and reshaping its mission. The new president could also try to expand the executive branch’s role in the rulemaking process and a Republican Congress will likely continue shrinking the already stressed agency’s budget. “You can’t eliminate the agency,” Gerrard said. “But you can starve and cripple it.” Trump’s choice to lead his EPA transition team, Myron Ebell, is a prominent climate change denier and director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the anti-regulatory Competitive Enterprise Institute. Ebell worked on policy for the tobacco industry before moving on to oppose environmental regulations and sow doubt on climate science. And while some in the green world think Trump may end up changing his mind about the appointment, crafting an EPA transition team hints that he’s backed off his call to do away with the agency. Either way, Ebell is certain to help shape Trump’s policies, from climate science to clean water rules, and influence his appointments. Others on the team include David Schnare, a former EPA lawyer who is now counsel with the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, a non-profit litigation group that targets efforts to address climate change. Schnare recently filed Freedom of Information Act () requests with several state attorneys general about the investigations they launched into ExxonMobil’s funding of climate denial.

    "content": "Foes of the Dakota Access pipeline tried to use the classic art of deception on Monday, hoping to mislead North Dakota authorities who may be using social media, particularly Facebook, to track the demonstrators. The tactical deception by supporters of the Standing Rock demonstrators began erupting on Facebook today when word began to circulate that the Morton County Sheriff’s Department was turning to social media to gain intelligence on who is gathering near the site of the proposed Dakota Access pipeline near Cannon Ball. “The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has been using Facebook check-ins to find out who is at Standing Rock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the prayer camps,” reads the Facebook post urging supporters of the pipeline worldwide to add their names to the illusory ploy. “SO Water Protecters are calling on EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them.” As of 4 p.m. Eastern time Monday, 907,899 people had checked in to the Standing Rock Facebook page. Its “likes” had also skyrocketed to more than 334,000. A representative of the Morton County Sheriff’s Department could not be reached for comment, but the department posted a statement on its Facebook page denying it is using the social media platform to track demonstrators. “The Morton County Sheriff’s Department is not and does not follow Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location. This claim / rumor is absolutely false,” according to the statement. As the number of people who said they are present in Cannon Ball continued to rise, there is little to indicate it has provided a strategic advantage to the protestors beyond signaling wide-ranging solidarity for the movement. It is not clear who started the posts, which have appeared on many Facebook pages supporting the pipeline opposition. The social media crusade has gone viral in the wake of ongoing protests supporting the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that is pushing back against Energy Transfer Partners as it builds a $3.8 billion pipeline to carry Bakken crude oil from North Dakota to Iowa. The pipeline’s route passes near the reservation’s border and crosses the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock reservation. The months-long protest has grown increasingly contentious and protesters have charged that authorities are employing harsh means to subdue activists, including the use of pepper spray and police dogs. In recent days, a new wave of arrests have been made as protesters set up camp on private ranchland along the pipeline route near Cannon Ball. The sweeping social media call for supporters to check in on Facebook has been heard by thousands of people. Many changed their Facebook status to reflect their “presence” in North Dakota. Others liked the page or sent messages of support. Adelyn Brown of Hamlet, N.C. says she’s in Cannon Ball. Natalie Rebori of Springfield, Mo., is there, too, according to her Facebook page. So is Beth Riley of Tulsa, Okla. and Mike Yagi of Los Angeles. But after checking in to Standing Rock, these people are sending follow-up messages to their Facebook friends, using code to indicate they are not in North Dakota but are a part of the Army of deception.

    "content": "Readings from coastal tide gauges around the world—the most reliable historical water-level records—have underestimated 20th century sea level rise caused by various melting ice caps and glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere by between 5 and 28 percent, said a new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Using historical tide gauge observations as well as climate models, the researchers found that the least amount of global sea level rise that could have occurred last century is about 5.5 inches. “The most likely amount,” the study concluded, “is closer to 6.7 inches,” with implications for the hundreds of millions of people who live along the world’s coasts. The readings come mainly from 15 gauges in North America and Europe, where sea level rise has likely been slower than the global average, skewing earlier estimates. The study shows that melting ice raises sea level faster than the global average in areas farthest from the melt sources, like the southern Pacific Ocean and equatorial regions. Sea level rise due to the Greenland ice melt, for instance, has been underestimated by 28 percent, the study said, while the sea level drop from the melting Alps was underestimated by 5 percent. “If you want to understand the future, you have to understand how much sea level rise was caused by past warming,” said lead author Philip Thompson, associate director of the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center. The study is also important because it helps identify regional patterns of sea level rise, information that can help communities adapt to rising water in coming decades. “This is the frontier in sea level science right now,” Thompson said. “We care about human timescale planning, decisions we’re going to make in the next 10 to 20 or 30 years.” Total global ice melt since",

    "title": "Florida Ballot Measure Could Halt Rooftop Solar, but Do Voters Know That?",
    "date": "2016-10-20T12:00:39-04:00",
    "content": "Floridians will vote on a constitutional amendment that is couched in pro-solar power language but would actually give utilities, which are funding the ballot measure, more power to block rooftop solar development in the Sunshine State. Amendment 1, if approved by 60 percent of voters in November, would write people’s right to own or lease solar panels and other equipment into the state constitution. But it would also make it unconstitutional to require a utility’s non-solar customers to subsidize those who do go solar. Those subsidies have helped make home solar affordable and are the best incentive to push the fast-growing energy source to widespread use. “There’s a lot on the line because the ballot is incredibly deceptive,” said David Pomerantz, the executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, a pro-renewable energy think tank. “Basically, these utilities don’t want distributed solar to develop in the state. And the message they will send if they win is that they can swamp any threat to their monopoly with enough money.” The ultimate target, according to the measure’s critics, is taking down “net metering,” a popular incentive for solar energy adopted by Florida and nearly every state. Net metering has been under attack by utilities and conservative groups like the Koch brothers’ network. It requires utilities to buy power that homeowners with solar panels generate but don’t use. It’s a tremendous benefit to solar users, but utilities say they unfairly have to raise rates on non-solar customers to pay for it and for grid upkeep. The utility-led coalition behind Amendment 1, called Consumers for Smart Solar, says the amendment is necessary “to stop unfair subsidies.” “We can’t have lower-income people or people who don’t choose solar have their rates raised dramatically down the road,” said Screven Watson, a board member of Consumers for Smart Solar. But a leaked audio recording this week lent credence to the claim that Florida utilities have intentionally tried to mislead consumers. The recording was obtained by the Energy and Policy Institute and by the Center for Media and Democracy, a corporate watchdog group. In it, Sal Nuzzo, vice president of policy at the James Madison Institute, a Tallahassee-based free market think tank with ties to at least one of the utilities behind Amendment 1, said utilities can use the “language of promoting solar” to advance their interests. He was speaking at an event organized by Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, which promotes free markets and limited government, on Oct. 2. Nuzzo called the amendment “an incredibly savvy maneuver.” “To the degree that we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu and take what they’re kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy, in legislation or in constitutional referendums if that’s the direction you want to take, use the language of promoting solar, and kind of, kind of put in these protections for consumers that choose not to install rooftop,” Nuzzo said. On the recording, Nuzzo said that Consumers for Smart Solar approached the James Madison Institute for guidance. But when asked by the Tampa Bay Times whether this was true, he said he misspoke at the event, and that there was no partnership between the groups. Florida has the third-highest solar rooftop potential in the U.S., yet only one-tenth of 1 percent of utility customers own solar. It ranks 17th nationally for installed capacity. This tiny penetration is because the state lacks the policies of many other states, such as a renewable energy standard for utilities or power purchase agreements, a common way to finance rooftop, or distributed, solar. Four state utilities—Florida Power and Light Company, Duke Energy, Tampa Electric Company and Gulf Power Company—overwhelmingly funded the more than $21 million spent on Amendment 1. Another significant funder, with a $1.4 million donation, is the 60 Plus Association, a seniors advocacy group that espouses free market solutions and has ties to the Koch network. Consumers for Smart Solar has representatives from the Democratic, Republican and Tea parties as well as faith-based groups and business organizations, such as the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Consumers for Smart Solar spent about 10 times more than its opponents, led by the group Floridians for Solar Choice, on the ballot initiative. The big concern among solar advocates is that passage will allow utilities to persuade regulators that net metering is a subsidy that should be changed or eliminated. Without net metering, grid-connected home solar would become too expensive for most families. And it could push solar installers out of the state, as happened in Nevada this year when utility regulators substantially cut the net metering credit and raised electricity rates for solar users. Major solar installers ceased their operations there, and rooftop solar installations have ground to a halt. “We don’t know for sure what they’ll do—we can only go by what we’ve seen in other states. But the utility trade association (the Edison Electric Institute) generally uses the same playbook on challenges to solar and when you see the word ‘subsidy,’ in general, they’re talking about net metering,” said Albert Gore III, deputy director of policy and electricity markets at installer SolarCity and son of former Vice President Al Gore. Across the country, utilities are becoming more aggressive. In at least 46 states, regulators, lawmakers or utilities have proposed, studied, or put into place policies to address the rise of solar, according to the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. In Nevada, for instance, the state public utility commission earlier this year voted to triple the fixed monthly charges solar customers pay and to reduce the net metering rate from 9.1 cents per kilowatt-hour to 2.6 cents over 12 years. In Florida, utilities pay the retail rate for net metering. Distributed energy threatens utilities, many of which are regulated monopolies, because it disrupts the century-old traditional business model. Utilities make money by building power plants or power distribution infrastructure, earning a rate of return established by regulators. Customer-generated electricity lowers revenue and could lure ratepayers to defect from the grid altogether. The controversial language in the Florida amendment addresses subsidies, asking voters whether they want “to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do.” Despite an effort to defeat Amendment 1 and editorial boards across the state coming out against it, a recent poll shows the measure is likely to pass. The Saint Leo University Polling Institute’s September poll has 84 percent of voters likely to vote yes, “despite the lack of knowledge about what the amendment would actually do,” institute director Frank Orlando said in a statement. The drama around Amendment 1 has been playing out in Florida over the past two years. It came in direct response to another ballot petition drive launched early in",

    "title": "Leading Fossil Fuel Companies Fail Climate Responsibility Test",
    "date": "2016-10-13T10:00:39-04:00",
    "content": "A methodical review of the world’s dominant fossil fuel producers has documented their poor performance—in some cases, egregious failure— in taking responsibility for their emissions of greenhouse gases and moving effectively to confront climate change. “None of them has made a clean break from disinformation on climate science and policy,” said a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, published by four of its senior climate experts last week. “None of the eight companies has laid out a company-wide pathway or plan to align its business model with the Paris Climate Agreement.” The study looked at BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, ExxonMobil, and Shell, the five largest investor-owned oil companies in cumulative emissions; as well as Arch Coal, CONSOL Energy and Peabody, which are the three leading coal companies by the same measure. Exxon and the coal companies come out at the bottom of the responsibility rankings. Exxon and Chevron were called egregious for failing to renounce climate science denial, and the coal companies for failing to adjust to the low-carbon requirements of the new Paris agreement, which aims at reaching zero net emissions of carbon dioxide late in this century. Only BP and Shell avoided low scores for the “accuracy and consistency of public statements on climate science and the consequent need for swift and deep reductions in emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.” UCS, a science advocacy group that has long campaigned for corporations to behave proactively on climate, argues that the eight companies bear special corporate responsibility for climate change, because they have accounted for 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution. UCS called on the companies to renounce disinformation on climate science and policy; plan their corporate strategies around the march to a carbon-free world in as short a time as possible; support fair and effective climate policies in keeping with the new Paris agreement; and fully disclose climate risks to investors and the public. The group has pushed hard for state and federal attorneys general and financial regulators to hold Exxon and other fossil fuel companies accountable for their climate policies. In particular, UCS has documented and criticized corporate support for groups that push views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change. This study goes beyond a generic, impressionistic complaint about the words and deeds of the fossil fuel industry. The science group fully explains its analysis, and its point-based ranking system includes many factors that make up each company’s report card. The UCS grades on a tough curve, and even the better performers earn only mediocre ratings. The worst, including Exxon and Peabody, come in for stern rebukes. (Both companies have been investigated by Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York; Peabody reached a settlement a year ago, as his probe of Exxon was being disclosed.) In painstaking fashion, using 30 separate metrics grouped into four main themes, the UCS scorecard ranks the companies’ records in comparison to each other. In some cases, the criteria are subjective, as in docking points for belonging to trade association or policy groups that take positions out of step with mainstream science or oppose particular climate policies. The UCS cited the companies’ affiliations with the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the American Legislative Exchange Council, the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Mining Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Western States Petroleum Association as markers against corporate climate accountability. The UCS also objected to companies that oppose new federal regulations on carbon pollution from power plants, methane emissions from oil and gas fields—or ideas like a carbon price. Companies were also marked down if they did not expressly endorse the Paris agreement, which is about to enter into force and which calls for moving rapidly to make steep cuts in carbon emissions. Similarly, if the companies did not put forth plans for moving to a low-carbon energy economy in line with the Paris targets, that drew a bad mark. One appendix alone provides 47 pages of detailed analysis of each company’s commitment to a low-carbon world—including page after page of material quoting each company’s justifications of its approach. For each of the eight companies reviewed, the report includes a separate scorecard. In Exxon’s case, this runs seven pages and addresses in detail several aspects of the company’s climate stance, such as its professed support for a tax on carbon, and its involvement with the American Legislative Exchange Council, which opposes such a tax. On the question of a carbon tax, UCS rated Exxon “fair.” It noted that Exxon has declared that it supports a revenue-neutral carbon tax—in other words, one that pays back all revenues in the form of individual or corporate tax cuts. But it also pointed out that Exxon’s own External Citizenship Advisory Panel has asked for more specific details about this and other climate policies. On the Clean Power Plan, major emissions regulations that industry and fossil fuel-friendly states have challenged in court, Exxon was rated “poor” because it funded the Pacific Legal Foundation, one of the plaintiffs opposing the rules.

    "date": "2016-09-21T13:54:41-04:00",
    "content": "Just when the legal and legislative jousting over Exxon’s climate record seemed to be bogging down in posturing and partisanship, the powerful Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped in with pointed questions about the oil giant’s disclosures of the risks of global warming. The development, coming a year after a series of investigations were sparked by reports by InsideClimate News and other news organizations, is significant in at least three ways. First, the SEC’s new involvement turns the Exxon investigations from a matter being pursued by a handful of state attorneys general into a federal case. Second, the action underscores that the issue goes far beyond mere uncertainties in climate science, or policy differences about addressing the mounting climate crisis, and involves significant financial risks to Exxon and its investors. The SEC is not only interested in what Exxon’s scientists knew, but what its accountants knew, too. Third, and perhaps most significant, the SEC’s involvement backs the Exxon questioners’ contention that they are not merely on a partisan witch hunt, as Exxon’s defenders have been trying to paint their investigations. All of the attorneys general known to be investigating Exxon are elected Democrats, and some of their Republican counterparts have come to Exxon’s defense by challenging the state subpoenas. So have Republicans in Congress, including those on the House Science Committee, who charge that the AGs have been colluding with environmental advocates to infringe on the company’s rights. The SEC, on the other hand, is not just a dogged regulatory agency, but a scrupulously non-partisan one, independent of political influence by statute and design. It is focused on enforcing transparency in the financial reports of publicly traded companies. And it is increasingly intent on making sure that climate risks are properly disclosed. “At the end of the day,” Mary Jo White, the commission’s chairwoman, said in a speech shortly after President Obama selected her to lead the agency, “we make our decisions based on an impartial assessment of the law and the facts and what we believe will further our mission—and never in response to political pressure, lobbying, or even public clamor.” She pointed out that the commissioners include two Democrats, two Republicans, and herself—an Independent. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Tuesday that the SEC has opened its probe of Exxon’s accounting and risk disclosures. The company’s outside auditors, PriceWaterhouse, are also being questioned, and the SEC has been receiving information provided by Exxon to New York’s attorney general as well, the Journal reported. The article, which is based on unnamed sources, said that beyond the implications for Exxon, “the probe may also signal the opening of a new front of climate-related regulation and enforcement at the SEC, a direction with far-reaching consequences for the oil and gas industry.” According to the Journal, the SEC “asked Exxon to produce information about its analysis of climate data and research, how it values assets and how a more serious global response to climate change would impact its business.” “The agency specifically asked what would happen to Exxon under a scenario envisioned by last year’s Paris climate talks—if greenhouse gas emissions were reduced 80% by",

    "date": "2016-09-26T15:00:23-04:00",
    "content": "Ever since the Clean Power Plan was introduced by the Environmental Protection Agency to crack down on carbon pollution from electricity plants, its advocates have disputed the assertion that it would be unduly burdensome and costly for utility companies. Indeed, they often note, its goals are already almost within reach. But if that’s so, the flip side of their argument is that the plan may not be demanding enough for the U.S. to meet its initial pledges under the new Paris treaty. Now a new peer-reviewed study by researchers at a national lab offers more evidence that like other government policies aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases, the reductions sought under the CPP are too little and too late for the U.S. to keep its Paris promise. “Additional mitigation measures will probably be required,” said the study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. It warned that “time is short” to fill the U.S. emissions gap of roughly 1.5 billion tons per year of carbon dioxide. That’s the real reason that this week’s oral arguments in litigation brought by coal states and fossil fuel companies to overturn the rules are so momentous. The hearing begins Tuesday before the full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Even if the Clean Power Plan, the linchpin of President Obama’s climate policy, sails through the appeals court and is upheld by the Supreme Court next year, its regulations will only pave the way for stricter reductions in the years to come. Those will include new measures to drive coal use down more steeply and broader rules to cut emissions from other industries, such as refineries. Presenting legal arguments that by now are familiar, the plan’s challengers will emphasize that even the relatively loose and highly flexible strictures of the EPA’s approach is an illegal over-extension of federal power. Its defenders will emphasize that the Supreme Court has repeatedly decreed that the Clean Air Act gives the agency the power to control carbon dioxide. Nobody will dispute that coal has been under assault for years, caught in a pincer between markets and regulations. Last week, the White House’s economic council issued a broad review of climate-related trends that showed a steady decline in overall carbon emissions from the energy industry. They all have worked against coal: the recession that hit just as President Obama was elected; an increase in energy efficiency; and competition from natural gas and renewables. As a result, a significant part of the emissions decline projected if the Clean Power Plan takes full effect—32 percent by",

    "date": "2016-09-14T18:16:59-04:00",
    "content": "Rep. Lamar Smith argued on Wednesday that not only does his House Science committee have the authority to subpoena two state attorneys general investigating ExxonMobil, but a constitutional obligation to ensure that science isn’t being undermined by such investigations. But while the committee hearing was ostensibly to address the constitutional issues of Smith’s subpoenas, it served as a showcase for scholarly disagreements and political divides. Looming over the 2½-hour hearing were the questions of whether the committee was abusing its oversight authority to defend the oil and gas industry—and Exxon—against legitimate probes by New York’s Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts’ Maura Healey, or whether it was standing up to attempts to suppress dissenting views on climate change. The genesis of the hearing was the refusal by the two attorneys general to comply with Smith’s subpoenas seeking information on their ongoing investigations into whether Exxon misled investors on climate change. “The documents demanded will allow the committee to assess the breadth and depth of the AG’s investigations and inform our understanding of whether their actions have a chilling impact on scientific research and development,” Smith said in his opening remarks. “The question we explore today isn’t partisan, it’s institutional. Allowing subpoenaed parties to ignore compliance based on the politics of the subject sets a dangerous precedent.” Eddie Bernice Johnson, the ranking Democrat on the committee, called the hearing politically motivated and designed to advance the agenda of the fossil fuel industry. “The Majority has claimed that their investigation is about protecting the First Amendment rights of ExxonMobil,” Johnson said. “However, the law is clear: fraud is not protected by the First Amendment. If any companies in the oil industry defrauded the public or their shareholders in their well-documented disinformation campaign on global warming, then that is a matter for the state AGs and the courts, not the Committee on Science.” The hearing brought no resolution to the question of the committee’s authority and Smith briefly discussed the possibility of going to court to force the AGs’ compliance. Smith called the hearings as part of his escalating hostilities with Schneiderman and Healey. Smith has charged that their investigations are politically motivated, while absorbing the same criticism for his defense of Exxon, the largest corporation in his home state. The two attorneys general and eight non-governmental advocacy groups have refused to comply with subpoenas issued by Smith in July. The subpoenas demand documents pertaining to the ongoing investigations and any discussions the agencies have had with the organizations. Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Schneiderman, called the hearing a “farce.” “No amount of Congressional grandstanding will change the simple fact that the Committee has no lawful basis to interfere with a state law enforcement investigation,” he said. “Attorneys General Schneiderman and Healey have launched a serious fraud investigation into Exxon and will not be intimidated or deterred by Big Oil’s friends on Capitol Hill.” Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for Healey, said the hearing did nothing more than add to the unwarranted attack on the Massachusetts investigation. “This hearing is just another attempt by Congressman Lamar Smith and his colleagues to interfere with our lawful and ongoing investigation into whether ExxonMobil deceived Massachusetts consumers and investors about the impacts of fossil fuels on Exxon’s business, assets, and the environment,” she said. To bolster his contention that the subpoenas were legally justified, Smith called three witnesses, including two law professors with connections to think tanks funded by the fossil fuel industry and who have been critical of the attorneys general. The Democratic minority was allowed to call one witness, who once served as the acting general counsel for the House of Representatives. The first of Smith’s witness, Jonathan Turley, a liberal law scholar and professor of public interest law at The George Washington University Law School, opened by saying he was a firm believer in climate change. He also said that did not factor into his view of the subpoenas. “This committee clearly has the ability to insist on compliance with its subpoenas,” Turley said, because the attorneys general have no absolute privilege to shield them. “Something may be unprecedented is not unconstitutional,” Turley said. Turley agreed with Smith that the state investigations could have a chilling effect on scientific research. “This was a step too far. It is delving into the area of differences of opinions,” he said. Ronald D. Rotunda, a law professor of at Chapman University’s Dale E. Fowler School of Law, also argued that the committee was within its legal bounds to enforce its subpoenas. Rotunda is associated with the Heartland Institute and a frequent contributor to the organization’s policy blog, which often features writings challenging the scientific evidence of man-made climate change. “The American people have a right to know if Mr. Schneiderman is working on his own, or is he part of a corrupt deal with some of these climate groups,” Rotunda said. “People that don’t comply with subpoenas have something to hide—that’s why they don’t comply.” Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law professor and former acting general counsel for the House of Representatives, argued against the legality of the subpoenas. “No House committee has ever tried—nor should ever try—to enforce subpoenas against state attorneys general,” said Tiefer, the lone witness called by the Democratic minority.“The committee has failed to identify even one single House subpoena to a state attorney general in 200 years. The reason? It’s never happened.” Remarks and questioning of the witness by the members of the committee revealed a deep philosophical gulf between Republicans and Democrats. Illinois Democrat Bill Foster lamented that the science committee was wasting its time on the issue. “We are talking about subpoenas and should be focused instead on assuring that the U.S. remains on the leading edge of scientific discovery,” he said. “It is long past time this committee accepts the facts of climate change and takes on the very of important matter of figuring out where we go to address the biggest challenge of our lifetime.” Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, said he wanted to “emphasize something about this quote unquote climate change phrase.” “The so-called climate change debate is about the role humanity has played— if any—in today’s version of climate,” he said. It ignores “the cost to humanity in terms of depressed economics of implanting so alleged climate cures.” Shortly before Smith gaveled his hearing to order, a number of Democratic leaders joined with environmental organizations near the Capitol to denounce Smith, to show support for Schneiderman and Healy and urge more state attorneys generals to open investigations of Exxon. Among those were Rep. Ted Lieu and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse who have been pressing for investigations of Exxon by the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Whitehouse called the tactics being employed by Smith “worrisome” and lambasted the committee’s majority as acting as the “agent” of Exxon. “Exxon is using Rep. Smith as a tool to obstruct the investigations and to obstruct the truth,” he said. The attorneys generals’ investigations coincide with the publication of an investigative series of stories in InsideClimate News last year that disclosed Exxon’s executives were warned of the possible catastrophe consequences of greenhouse gas emissions in the late",

    "content": "A former Environmental Protection Agency adviser will not be investigated for scientific fraud, the EPA’s  recently decided. The office was responding to environmental advocates who had charged that David Allen’s work had underreported methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The North Carolina advocacy group NC Warn had filed a 65-page petition with the  calling for an investigation into a pair of recent, high-profile studies on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas production. The group alleged that Allen, the studies’ lead author, brushed aside concerns that the equipment he used underestimated the volume of methane emitted. It argued his conduct rose to the level of fraud. Methane is a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term. Knowing exactly how much of the gas escapes from the oil and gas wells, pipelines and other infrastructure is a key part of ongoing efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. Following NC Warn’s complaint, 130 organizations called on the EPA’s  to expedite an investigation into the allegations. “This office declined to open an investigation. Moreover, this [case] is being closed,” the ’s office wrote in a July 20 letter to NC Warn. The EPA letter did not provide information on how the agency came to its decision not to open an investigation. Allen, a former chairman of the EPA’s outside science advisory board and a University of Texas engineering professor, declined to comment on NC Warn’s allegations or the EPA’s response. He noted, however, a National Academy study now being developed that seeks to improve measurements and monitoring of methane emissions. “We expect the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study to be a fair and thorough treatment of the issue, and we look forward to the report,” Allen said. NC Warn is “extremely dissatisfied” with the ’s dismissal of the allegations, Jim Warren, the group’s executive director, wrote to EPA  Arthur Elkins Jr., on Aug. 4. “We ask you to intervene to reconsider your agency’s action and to personally lead the expedited investigation in this extremely important scandal.” Warren said in his letter that NC Warn provided documentation to the  in June backing up its charges. Those documents, Warren argued, showed that at least 10 individuals, including two members of the EPA’s science advisory board and one EPA staff member, knew that equipment used by Allen was flawed and underreporting methane emissions prior to publication of the two studies. “We are currently drafting a response to Mr. Warren,“ Jeffrey Lagda, a spokesman for the EPA’s , said in a statement.

As the chief executive of America’s biggest steel maker for 13 years, Dan DiMicco repeatedly went to battle against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. His company, Nucor, fought the EPA in court over its moves to curb greenhouse gases, and it was assessed one of the EPA’s largest penalties ever against a steel company for clean air violations. Nucor also funded climate change denial efforts. DiMicco has argued that U.S. efforts to control carbon emissions would further strengthen China’s unfair hand in winning business—and jobs.

With carbon controls in place or planned on the biggest sources—vehicles and power plants—growing pollution from aviation “is an important element” in tackling the climate crisis, said Janet McCabe, a top EPA official. The action taken today completes the first phase of bringing the problem to heel under the Clean Air Act. Eventually, it is expected to lead to specific engine emission regulations that are at least as stringent as those being negotiated through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations body that includes the United States. Fixing the problem will be costly, so unless all nations take action in a coordinated way, the world’s passenger airlines might be jostled about by turbulent economic winds.

    "content": "Global warming is intensifying some of the world’s most important ocean currents, new research shows, raising the risk of damaging storms along heavily populated coastlines of China and Japan. The findings are sobering as China and Taiwan rebound from the devastating effects of super typhoon Nepartak last week. The western boundary currents, which run along the eastern coasts of South Africa, Asia, Australasia, and South America, carry massive amounts of heat from the tropics poleward. The recent research by a group of scientists with the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany found they are strengthening, warming and moving poleward. “They have been getting stronger and warmer since CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing,” said study author Hu Yang. “This heat must be released to the atmosphere. The most common way to release the heat is storms.” Yang said storms like Nepartak, which took aim at Taiwan and the Chinese mainland last week, are likely to become more common in coming decades. Nepartak strengthened as it passed over the Kuriosho Current late last week, generating sustained winds of 160 miles per hour. The storm weakened slightly before making landfall along the Taiwan coast, where it dropped up to 20 inches of rain in some spots. “The coastal region of China, the western Pacific, is seeing much more warming than the global average, and it’s because of this intensification,” Hu said. “These currents will bring much more heat and precipitation in the future. China and Japan will suffer more warming than other regions.” The study, published in June in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, looked at the Kuroshio Current, the Gulf Stream, the Brazil Current, the East Australian Current and the Agulhas Current, which are western branches of gyres that circulate around the perimeter of the world’s subtropical oceans—clockwise in the northern hemisphere, counterclockwise the southern hemisphere. They are fast, much warmer than the surrounding ocean and have a “broad impact on the weather and climate over the adjacent mainland,” including the formation of intense storms, according to the study. They also play an important role in distributing heat globally. Previous studies have suggested that the currents — with the exception of the Gulf Stream — have all strengthened in recent decades.

    "content": "One million solar power installations now dot America’s rooftops and landscape, an achievement being hailed as a milestone by advocates of solar energy. There were just 1,000 such projects at the turn of this century, and only six years ago, going solar cost twice as much. Still, those one million installations deliver just 1 percent of electricity in the U.S., the world’s second-largest energy consumer after China. Globally, the figure is roughly the same. If the goal of keeping global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius is to be met, then climate-changing emissions will have to drop by as much as 70 percent by mid-century. That will demand a wholesale, worldwide transformation to carbon-zero energy. And that means solar—rooftop panels on residences, commercial applications and larger-scale utility deployments—will have to accelerate, and soon. “There’s no question that solar has… huge potential to contribute to meeting climate change goals,” said Jessika Trancik, a professor of engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But it’s still an open question as to whether it will get there.” Just to level off emissions over the next 50 years, the world’s solar capacity would have to increase 100-fold, according to research by the Princeton-based Carbon Mitigation Initiative. Solar is one of several possible carbon stabilization “wedges.” But for solar to be effective, seven other low-carbon wedges—in key areas like energy efficiency, wind power, coal-to-gas power switching, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, nuclear, and slowing deforestation—also must deliver huge reductions as well. In Germany and China, the world’s solar leaders, the race to combat climate change and curb air pollution has led to aggressive clean energy targets and federal laws that favor renewables.

    "title": "Exxon Rejects Shareholder Requests to Address Climate Change",
    "date": "2016-05-26T06:00:45-04:00",
    "content": "Following the recommendation of the ExxonMobil board of directors, shareholders voted against six resolutions that would have addressed climate change at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Dallas on Wednesday. The resolutions included electing a board member with expertise on climate science, enacting policies to limit global warming, paying special dividends rather than investing more in fossil fuel reserves, and publishing an annual report on how climate policies could affect the company financially. Rejection of the initiatives was expected and continued more than a quarter century of opposition to shareholder resolutions by the company on climate change. While none of the resolutions directly related to climate change passed, one that would let minority shareholders nominate outsiders for seats on the board and could thereby provide a pathway for a climate expert to become a board member, did pass with approximately 60 percent of the vote. A climate resolution that called for Exxon to publish an annual report on how climate policies will impact the company, including the global goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius, got 38.2 percent of the vote. No prior climate resolution had ever gained more than 31.2 percent. Explore in-depth Exxon’s track record – Exxon’s 25 Years of ‘No’: Timeline of Resolutions on Climate Change “An unprecedented number of Exxon’s shareholders have demanded that it analyze how a 2˚C transition will impact its business,” Robert Schuwerk, senior counsel for the environmental group Carbon Tracker, said in a statement. “Exxon must now meet this demand or confront a more wary investor class next year.” Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy group, had helped organize investors representing more than $10 trillion to support the 2-degree resolution. “Given the significant resources Exxon spent fighting this proposal, such a strong vote is a real rebuke to company management,” Andrew Logan, Ceres’ director of oil & gas programs, said in a statement. A separate resolution went further in calling for a policy committing Exxon to support the goal of limiting climate change to 2 degrees Celsius. This resolution received 18.5 percent of the vote. The resolution was brought forward by Sister Patricia Daly of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell, N.J. Speaking at the meeting, Daly said that in urging shareholder rejection of the resolution, Exxon management “has chosen to disregard the consensus of the scientific community, the will of 195 nations that signed the Paris agreement in December, many of our peers in the oil and gas communities, and the calls of faith leaders from the Catholic, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and interfaith traditions.” Read: Exxon’s Gamble: 25 Years of Rejecting Shareholder Concerns on Climate Change The votes came as a number of leading oil companies, under mounting pressure, are assessing how they address climate change. The French oil company Total published a report on Tuesday with a goal of supporting the 2-degree goal. The report noted that Total will move away from tar sands oil and Arctic drilling and will apply an internal cost on carbon. Chevron shareholders voted against several climate-related measures at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday. They included a call to publish an annual report on how legislation designed to curb climate change could affect the company. Exxon, in particular, has faced increased scrutiny of its climate policies from dozens of activist shareholder groups, as well as members of Congress, climate scientists and environmental advocates. In the months following a series of stories last year by InsideClimate News and other news organizations, Exxon became the target of probes by state attorneys general, who are investigating whether the company violated racketeering, consumer protection or investor protection statutes through what it said about global warming. In Exxon’s meeting, the question-and-answer period grew heated when one shareholder asked chief executive Rex Tillerson when the company would publicly condemn deception on climate change. “We will never withdraw our support for people to express their free speech opinions on any matter whatsoever,” Tillerson said. “The fact that people have different opinions on climate change, they have every right to their opinion, whether we agree with it or not, I will support their right to say so.” When pressed on the need to move quickly away from fossil fuels, Tillerson said, “The reality is there is no alternative energy source known on the planet or available to us today to replace the pervasiveness of fossil fuels in our global economy and in our very quality of life. And I would go beyond that and say our very survival.” Tillerson said fossil fuel energy is needed to address the immediate needs of humanity including poverty, starvation, and disease control. “The only way out of that is to provide them the energy sources we have today,” he said. “That is why we continue to believe fossil fuels will have a significant and important role to play for as far as we can see.” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who has led calls for a federal investigation of Exxon’s potential climate fraud, said he was as encouraged by the shareholder activism as he was discouraged by Exxon’s response. “As someone who sees firsthand the malevolent lobbying presence of ExxonMobil in Congress, I’m not surprised,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “But I am heartened that ExxonMobil’s shareholders rebelled against the corporation in such large numbers. The fossil fuel giant’s days of climate obstruction and obfuscation are numbered.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Exxon Unlikely to Change Course on Climate Change at Annual Shareholder Meeting",
    "date": "2016-05-23T11:00:33-04:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil Corp. wants to extend its quarter-century streak of largely resisting the demands of some of its most vocal shareholders to alter course on climate change. At the annual stockholders meeting on Wednesday, management will again urge rejection of six resolutions on global warming. These include taking moral responsibility for climate change, electing a board member with environmental expertise, paying special dividends rather than investing more in fossil fuel reserves, and assessing how global action to slow climate change would affect Exxon’s business. What’s different this year is that Exxon is doing so in the face of mounting pressure from dozens of activist stockholder groups, including some with significant holdings. State attorneys general are investigating whether Exxon violated racketeering, consumer protection or investor protection statutes through what it said about climate change. Other oil companies are already shifting gears. Shell, BP and Statoil last year backed resolutions to assess the implications of restrictions on fossil fuel use, and ConocoPhillips is conducting such an analysis. “The go-slow approach is no longer a responsible position as seen by many investors,” said Andrew Logan, director of the oil and gas program at Ceres, a Boston nonprofit that coordinates action by many of the nation’s largest institutional investors. “Climate change is not the fringe issue that it was 25 years ago,” Logan said. “It has become an urgent existential issue, one that needs immediate attention, not one that can be put off as Exxon wants.” According to a Ceres tally, 71 shareholder organizations are urging a yes vote on the proposition requiring management to assess the business impact of government policies to hold global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, in accordance with last year’s Paris climate treaty. The list includes the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Comptroller. Together, they administer pension funds with 22.5 million Exxon shares, out of a total of more than 4 billion. “We believe investors would benefit from an assessment of ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves under a scenario consistent with the global emissions reduction target defined in the Paris Agreement,” the Calpers chief and the New York comptroller said in a letter to Exxon shareholders. Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers didn’t respond to a request for comment. Exxon isn’t the only oil and gas company resisting shareholder demands on climate accountability. Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy and Marathon Oil also are opposing resolutions seeking to shape corporate climate policy. Even as it faces increased scrutiny of its climate policies, Exxon maintains that it appreciates the risks of climate change and the potential consequences to its core business. Exxon is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, with a market value of more than $370 billion. Lately the stock has been trading at its highest price in more than a year, and its market capitalization ranks behind only those of Apple, Google and Microsoft. “We have the same concerns as people everywhere—and that is how to provide the world with the energy it needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” Exxon says in its position on climate change. “The risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action.” Exxon should get credit for trying to explain what it is doing about climate change, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of Boston-based Walden Asset Management, which promotes environmental, social and corporate responsibility on behalf of investors. “One of the things you see coming out of these resolutions is a smoking-out of the company—getting them to speak out generally about solutions,” Smith said. Exxon has not completely disregarded shareholders’ concerns, he said. In arguing against the resolution that Exxon take moral responsibility for global warming, for example, management says it understands reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a shared objective. “The company remains focused on finding practical, prudent and affordable solutions to address the dual challenge of expanding energy supplies to support economic growth, improve living standards, alleviate poverty and improve resilience while simultaneously addressing the societal and environmental risks posed by rising greenhouse gas emissions and climate change,” Exxon says. Those words seem hollow, said Sister Pat Daly of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell, N.J. Her organization wrote the moral imperative resolution and submitted it with 34 co-filers. “These are talking points that sound rather reasonable to the average person,” Daly said. “But when you look deeper, you see it means very little in terms of shifting of the business plan of ExxonMobil.” In the months following a series of stories by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times together with the Columbia University journalism school, Exxon has become the target of investigations by attorneys general in New York, California, Maryland and the Virgin Islands. Members of Congress, climate scientists, environmental advocates and Democratic presidential candidates have called for probes of Exxon by the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the proxy statement for next week’s annual meeting, Exxon paid the 12 board members who aren’t company employees between $341,000 and $748,000 last year. Rex Tillerson, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, was paid $27 million, and president Darren Woods, who also sits on the board and has been tapped to succeed Tillerson as CEO later this year, made $10 million. Stockholders have been urging Exxon to confront the threat of climate change for decades. They have pushed the company to invest in renewable energy, cut harmful emissions and perform carbon risk assessments. Exxon consistently opposed the resolutions, and none of them passed. Yet Exxon has displayed some flexibility with certain shareholder demands. The company agreed to prepare a carbon risk report in",

    "content": "As firefighters continue their struggle to contain the destructive forest fire that has already ravaged Fort McMurray, Alberta, new evidence shows that global warming will rapidly increase the risk of wildfires across northern regions of Europe, North America and Asia. That includes Alaska, where the likelihood of fires will grow up to four-fold in coming decades in areas where they have been rare. That puts at risk the edges of vast boreal forests, as well as tundra zones, according to a new study published in the journal Ecography. “We know some of these areas haven’t burned in thousands of years,” said University of Montana fire ecology researcher Philip Higuera, who led the study along with Adam Young, an affiliate scientist at the University of Montana. Across the state’s North Slope, above the Arctic Circle, the shift is “far outside the range of natural variability we’ve seen in the last 6,000 to 32,000 years,” Higuera said. Increased wildfire activity will change the shape and extent of boreal forests, and affect wildlife habitat and Alaska’s indigenous residents. And while climate change is the prime culprit, the fires will also intensify global warming. Burning organic soils and thawing permafrost will send even more CO2 into the atmosphere, according to Higuera and other scientists who study ecosystem changes in the region. “That four-fold increase by",

    "title": "By Getting Microgrids to ‘Talk,’ Energy Prize Winners Tackle the Future of Power",
    "date": "2016-05-11T06:01:32-04:00",
    "content": "An idea born in a California vineyard may make microgrids—small-scale electrical systems hailed as a big part of the future of climate-friendlier power—ready for their future starring role. Up to now, these highly localized versions of power plants, which serve mainly hospitals, military bases and colleges, have been more micro than grid because they don’t work well with each other. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology Ph.D. student and four colleagues were creating one at Stone Edge Farm in Sonoma, Calif., last year when they stumbled on a way to make them communicate more effectively. The group, who call the operation Heila Technologies, created an array involving gas generators, solar panels and batteries. And an innovation that sounds a bit like sleight of hand. Jorge Elizondo, a doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, said the system is a “distributed controller to simplify the process—to hide the complexity of every one of the elements in the system to make them look like a simple element.” The innovation won Elizondo and his colleagues the $100,000 MIT Clean Energy Prize earlier this month. What the team calls Heila IQ, is a “brain” to simplify microgrid operations and make distributed energy systems easier to manage. That, the group hopes, will bring more wind and solar power online. “Microgrids are usually controlled in a hierarchical way, so you have a central controller that commands different elements in the system to do something,” said Elizondo. “We are working on a layer below that, an interface between different systems in the microgrid.” Experts say the flexibility of microgrids can help reduce greenhouse-gas emissions that warm the planet—and help communities prepare for a more unpredictable climate. Microgrids encourage the development of wind and solar power systems, which are smaller and more nimble than coal or natural gas power plants, while emitting zero carbon emissions. In principle, microgrids can also make power systems more reliable and resilient because if a storm knocks out part of a microgrid network, the system would adjust the flow of power to compensate for a sudden shortfall of supply. Heila IQ aims to tackle a central challenge of microgrids: namely, how to command and control them, to get them to share information and respond to changes in concert with one another. For example, a battery in a microgrid needs to know to release stored power when clouds roll in and solar panels aren’t turning sunlight into electricity. A microgrid is one distinct, self-reliant piece of a smarter, more distributed power grid. It is a mini-network that links smaller, local power producers—like solar panels and gas generators—with local consumers such as buildings and electric vehicles. Microgrids often include batteries or other storage devices that keep power within the system for times when demand peaks or production drops. Consumers and producers in a microgrid might use data analytics, smart meters and other web-enabled energy technologies or apps to better match supply with demand. Most crucially, microgrid systems, in theory, “talk” to one another and the broader electrical grid itself, allowing it to shift supply where it’s needed. Upsetting the Monopoly Board The modern power grid, which supplies virtually all electricity consumed in the U.S., is largely centralized. Large plants generate power that radiates outward through transmission lines—like the hub and spokes of a wheel—to homes, businesses, and other consumers. For example, the Dresden Generating Station, a nuclear plant in northern Illinois, has a capacity of 1,845 megawatts and serves 1.5 million customers across the state. That dynamic is changing as utilities, power producers, and consumers increasingly rely on renewable energy sources, large-scale batteries, energy-management software and other “intelligent efficiency” technologies. The grid is beginning to look more like a diffuse network with multiple, discrete sources of energy production and consumption that can communicate with one another and rapidly adapt to changing circumstances. “[Historically,] the assumption was that we ought to have utility monopolies, because it was the only logical economic and political arrangement for a grid system that had to be centralized and where the economies of scale were so big,” said John Farrell, director of democratic energy at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit research and educational organization in Washington, D.C. “And all of the justification we have for that system is now eroding in the face of new technology and economic truths.” Those truths include rapidly falling costs of renewable technologies and the steadily increasing costs of extracting and burning fossil fuels.

Their argument is that the state-level investigations violate the First Amendment rights of those who question climate science. Exxon has sued to block a subpoena issued by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands, and in an unusual step, named as a defendant the Washington, D.C. law firm and attorney representing the territory in the inquiry. In its complaint against the Virgin Islands subpoena, Exxon wrote, “The chilling effect of this inquiry…strikes at protected speech at the core of the First Amendment.” In a pointed letter to Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Walker on April 20, CEI’s attorney called the subpoena “offensive” and “un-American,” and warned to “expect a fight.” Andrew Grossman, outside counsel for CEI, wrote, “You have no right to wield your power as a prosecutor to advance a policy agenda by persecuting those who disagree with you.” The conservative non-profit Energy & Environment Legal Institute, an ally of CEI, recently released emails that show that the attorneys general considering investigating Exxon were briefed by two environmentalists. E&E got the emails through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Vermont attorney general’s office. Though such meetings with environmental and industry advocates are widely considered routine, E&E described the meetings as secretive collusion, an idea that has been echoed on conservative websites and among some mainstream media outlets.

    "date": "2016-04-08T15:38:21-04:00",
    "content": "When Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton erupted in anger at a question along a rope line about campaign contributions from fossil fuel donors last week, it made news because of the previously placid nature of the Democratic presidential nomination race between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. But it also highlighted a new strategy by activists to get their issues addressed by the candidates. The video clip from a Greenpeace activist captured Clinton snapping, “I’m so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me. I’m sick of it,” and the exchange was instantly swept into the major media coverage of the campaign. With climate change taking a back seat to issues such as the economy, immigration and Wall Street bailouts, advocacy groups have been confronting candidates repeatedly along the rope lines at campaign stops, taping the interactions, and then publishing the videos online. Environmental advocacy groups Greenpeace and 350.org have been especially dogged, pressuring candidates—particularly Clinton—about their positions on donations from fossil fuel lobbyists, fracking or climate change science. The activists have asked similar questions of Sanders, but his answers reflect his official campaign platform opposing the fossil fuel industry. Clinton has historically been more moderate and industry-friendly on energy issues. Miles Goodrich, a campaigner with 350 Action who has been bird-dogging candidates since last year, said the rope-line encounters are an effective way to get candidates to address issues they might otherwise avoid. “The rope line is an opportunity for us to take back the discussions, it’s an opportunity for us to define what it is that the candidates are going to be arguing about. And there’s no way that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton would be debating about fossil fuel money to the extent that they are without my team and me asking Hillary Clinton about fossil fuel donations since December,” Goodrich said. The videos have captured Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders saying he strongly opposes fracking and Clinton has also taken a stronger stance against it in rope-line encounters than she has in speeches or other scripted events. A video even captured Clinton saying she would support a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into Exxon’s history of climate change denial. Republican candidates haven’t been spared either. Former GOP candidate Marco Rubio was caught saying climate change “doesn’t matter,” and that he wouldn’t “destroy our economy guys, for some wacky law” but then flip-flopped to say his constituents, “should be concerned by it.” Jeb Bush, another Republican candidate who has dropped out, said in November that burning fossil fuels has “seen a reduction in the amount of carbon emitted.” While this isn’t the first time taped encounters with candidates have been able to influence the debate on issues in elections, this is the first election where they’ve been strategically organized to inject an issue being largely ignored into the national discourse, Goodrich said.

    "date": "2016-04-08T12:34:15-04:00",
    "content": "It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict which oil and gas wells will emit large amounts of methane, a comprehensive study of more than 8,000 active facilities across the U.S. finds. Researchers were looking for ways to predict which wells leak the most, following prior studies that showed “superemitters” contribute the vast majority of oil and gas fields’ emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. If researchers could uncover a pattern, it would make predicting those superemitters and reducing their emissions easier. “It makes things a little more challenging,” said lead author David Lyon, a scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. “You are going to have to look at all the sites to find the high emissions.” The peer-reviewed study, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, relied on helicopter-based infrared camera surveys across seven major oil- and gas-producing regions. Wells were randomly selected and well operators were not notified prior to inspections. Nationwide, 4 percent of well sites surveyed were superemitters, releasing a minimum of 200 to 600 cubic feet of methane and other hydrocarbon gases into the atmosphere per hour, according to the study. The number of high emitters varied from as low as 1 percent in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin to 14 percent in North Dakota’s Bakken Formation. Wells in oil-producing regions were three times more likely to be superemitters than fields that produced natural gas. Knowing the type of well and its location, however, did not help in predicting a well’s rate of emissions. “Overall it was still mostly a random process,” Lyon said. “It really demonstrates the importance of things like continuous detection or frequent monitoring to find these high emission sites.” Curbing emissions of methane, which is 86 times more potent at warming the earth’s atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, is crucial in combating climate change.

    "date": "2016-03-22T18:50:44-04:00",
    "content": "Leading climate scientist James Hansen used a study published Tuesday to continue to hammer home the warning that humanity is nearing “the point of no return” when it comes to reversing or even mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. The study, initially made public in draft form last July as a “discussion paper” so it could be circulated ahead of the Paris climate talks, holds that multi-meter sea rise could happen within a matter of decades, rather than centuries as previous estimates suggested. Hansen argues the dramatic sea level rise could put the earth’s coastal cities in grave peril while a sudden influx of population from those cities will bring discord and conflict to the rest of the world. The study, co-authored by a team of 19 international climate scientists, was published this week in the peer-reviewed journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Hansen dismissed criticisms that the somewhat unorthodox study had stretched the science and blurred the line between advocacy and research. The conclusion that deep cuts in net emissions of carbon dioxide are required to avoid a global calamity is “a scientific conclusion,” he said. “It’s not advocacy. It’s telling you what is needed.” The study uses models, paleoclimate data and modern observations to analyze the impact of ice shed from Antarctic ice shelves and Greenland. It concludes the feedbacks created by the intrusion of cold freshwater into the planet’s oceans are already shutting down ocean circulation, leading to the formation of more powerful superstorms. The study also contends the real world has been responding much faster to the inundation of freshwater than the models anticipated. The study’s basic conclusions remain the same as the original, though the title was softened. The initial title of “Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming is highly dangerous” had the final phrase changed to “could be dangerous.” Hansen, the former director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and currently the director of the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions program at Columbia University Earth Institute, has been one of the foremost voices urging rapid and comprehensive action to slow greenhouse gas emissions. Hansen, 74, developed one of the world’s first climate models 35 years ago and has produced prediction after prediction about rising global warming that proved to be correct. “This is a tragic situation—because it is unnecessary. We could already be phasing out fossil fuel emissions if only we stopped allowing the fossil fuel industry to use the atmosphere as a free dumping ground for their waste,” Hansen said in a video accompanying the study’s publication, repeating previous statements he’s made on instituting a carbon tax. Hansen has been equally blunt about who’s to blame for the planet’s warming. He’s been arrested several times at climate protests targeting the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other fossil fuel projects. He and 21 young people between the ages of 8 and 19 are currently suing the federal government for promoting “the use of fossil fuels, thus increasing the concentration of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere to unsafe levels and creating the dangerous climate change and ocean acidification that we face today.” In a conference call Monday, Hansen said that if scientists don’t come out and say that drastic emissions cuts are needed, “then politicians will tell you what’s needed and that will be based on the politics, rather than on science. So I don’t see any reason not try to make the complete story clear rather than just drawing a line and saying, ‘I’m not going to step beyond this.’” The Paris Agreement, a treaty intended to slow global warming, limits fossil emissions and forest clearing in order to keep the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, and possibly to keep the rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Either ambitious target would require eliminating additions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. But the paper’s authors stress the 2 degree Celsius threshold would still lead to inexorable damage. “If Greenland freshwater shuts down deepwater formation and cools the North Atlantic several degrees, the increased horizontal temperature gradient will drive superstorms stronger than any in modern times,” Hansen said in the video. “All hell would break loose in the North Atlantic and neighboring lands.” The effects of ice melt on ocean circulation were not included in the latest assessment by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), meaning Hansen’s predictions would occur much earlier and be less gradual than envisioned in the consensus reports of the IPCC. Hansen’s renewed calls for aggressive climate policy comes as the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that",

    "date": "2016-03-23T17:30:56-04:00",
    "content": "More than 300 climate activists swarmed the Louisiana Superdome Wednesday morning to protest a federal auction of oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The action was part of the larger “Keep It in the Ground” movement aimed at stopping new fossil fuel production on publicly owned lands and waterways. The protesters—environmental justice and climate leaders, college students, community organizers, tribal members and pastors—massed in the morning outside the Superdome in New Orleans, waving signs and banners and erecting climate-related art displays. About 100 demonstrators then marched in the stadium and into the auction room, chanting: “Don’t auction our climate. The people won’t be quiet!” “We want to stop these lease sales,” said Cherri Foytlin, a local environmental activist who helped organize Wednesday’s event. “As long as these leases go through, [industry] is tying us to an archaic economy and an archaic way of doing things that is destroying our earth.” The New Orleans rally was the latest in a string of protests targeting federal onshore and offshore oil and gas leases. Activists have ramped up these protests in recent months, targeting auctions in Colorado, Nevada and Utah. Members of 17 local and national environmental justice and green organizations supported the event; attendees included Jane Kleeb, founder of Bold Nebraska, and Anne Rolfes, founder of the environmental justice group Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Campaigners including Rolfes stayed until the end of the auction, which proceeded as planned despite the disruption, and then joined the growing crowds outside; there were no arrests. By the auction’s end, the government received $156 million for bids covering 693,962 acres. Bids were submitted before the auction. “Today we sent a message to the oil industry,” Rolfes said from outside the Superdome. The New Orleans protest came a week after the Obama administration announced its new draft plan for offshore oil and gas leasing, which declared the Atlantic Coast off limits to drilling over the next five years. The same plan left open the door to drilling in Arctic waters off Alaska and allowed continued leasing in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf “is the next front in the fight,” Rolfes said. While there’s been pushback against drilling in the Atlantic and the Arctic, this is the first time in the Gulf “we are finally pushing back,” she said. Activists sent a letter last week to President Barack Obama asking him to cancel the Bureau of Ocean Management’s Gulf of Mexico lease sales of approximately 45 million acres for future oil and gas exploration. “An end to new leasing would keep up to 450 billion tons of carbon pollution in the ground and further cement your administration’s commitment to a better future,” they wrote. Another oil and gas lease sale for tracts in the Gulf is scheduled for later this year. According to Foytlin, attempts to engage with the oil industry and government officials on issues such as stopping spills and repairing old infrastructure have resulted in little action. “Now this is really the only option we have left, as far as I am concerned,” Foytlin said. “I’m willing to lose my freedom for that.” Foytlin said she and many others came to the protest prepared to get arrested for attempting to stop the auction. The Bureau of Ocean Management “respects the right of peaceful protest and welcomes the public” to Wednesday’s sale, spokesman John Filostrat told InsideClimate News in an email. Climate activists have stepped up civil disobedience campaigns in recent years to draw attention to their demands to stop new fossil fuel infrastructure projects; 1,200 people were arrested at an anti-Keystone XL oil pipeline protest at the White House in",

    "title": "Exxon Must Hold Shareholder Vote on Climate Change Resolutions, SEC Says",
    "date": "2016-03-25T10:00:28-04:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil must allow shareholders to vote on at least two prominent resolutions on climate change, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled. One measure calls on Exxon to take moral responsibility for climate change and adopt a policy to limit average global temperature increases. A second would compel the oil giant to explain how its business would be affected by the worldwide commitment to slowing climate change. They are among seven resolutions on global warming proposed for Exxon’s May 25 annual meeting. “The SEC has rejected Exxon’s attempt to silence investors’ concerns about growing financial risks associated with climate change trends, including escalating global demand for low-carbon energy,” said Shanna Cleveland, a senior manager at Ceres, a Boston nonprofit that coordinates action on issues important to many of the nation’s largest institutional investors. Separately, the Rockefeller Family Fund said it will divest its holdings in Exxon, calling the company’s behavior on climate change “morally reprehensible.” Activist stockholders are demanding more transparency about how much Exxon spends on organizations dedicated to obfuscating climate science and opposing emission regulations to slow climate change. They want Exxon to pledge to comply with measures to hold global warming under the 2-degree Celsius limit set by the Paris climate accord, and they want the company to add climate-conscious board members. The SEC issued a similar ruling that Chevron must allow a shareholder vote on a proposal requiring an analysis of the business implications of climate regulation, according to the Houston Chronicle. The seven resolutions for this year’s Exxon meeting continue a 25-year campaign by activist shareholders to get Exxon to confront the threat of climate change. Investor groups have fought to have the company invest in renewable energy, cut harmful emissions and perform carbon risk assessments. Exxon has regularly rejected shareholder requests, and no climate change resolution has been adopted. As with many publicly traded companies, Exxon’s management often asks the SEC to rule on whether it must submit resolutions for a shareholder vote. Exxon declined to comment on the SEC rulings. The SEC shot down Exxon’s attempt to block the shareholder resolution calling for the company to assert moral leadership on climate change and pledge to work toward limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less. It is sponsored by 34 shareholder groups under the umbrella of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. “For the first time ExxonMobil shareholders will grapple with the moral and justice implications of climate change, as related to the company’s business,” said Susana McDermott, director of communications for the Interfaith Center, in a statement. Exxon tried to persuade the SEC that the resolution was “vague and indefinite.” The company also said it had already taken steps to address global warming. The SEC ruled that the company failed to make a persuasive argument that there was no need for shareholders to have a voice on how the company addresses climate change. “Based on the information you have presented, it appears that the company’s policies, practices and procedures do not compare favorably with the guidelines of the proposal and that ExxonMobil has not, therefore, substantially implemented the proposal,” the SEC said in its letter to Exxon. That indicates regulators see a disconnect between what the resolution seeks and what Exxon says it has already done, said Mary Beth Gallagher, associate director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, one of the organizations representing shareholders. “This puts before the membership the question of Exxon’s operation and their strategies and the impact of what they do to society,” Gallagher said. “It is a threshold moment to consider the company’s role in society.” In the case of the proposal requiring an analysis of how the Paris climate accord will affect Exxon’s business, the company argued that the resolution was too vague and that the company had already sufficiently answered the question. The resolution was introduced in December by the New York State comptroller along with the Church of England’s investment fund, the Vermont State Employees’ Retirement System, the University of California Retirement Plan and the Brainerd Foundation. Exxon told the SEC that strict emission limits to hold global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius are unlikely, although world governments agreed to such a goal in last year’s Paris climate accord. The SEC rejected Exxon’s position and ruled that the proposal should go before the annual meeting. “Based on the information you have presented, it does not appear that Exxon Mobil’s public disclosures compare favorably with the guidelines of the proposal,” said Justin A. Kisner, an attorney-adviser at the SEC, in a letter to Exxon. The company fought the resolution because it did not want to confront the truth about how extensive the impact would be on its business, said Cleveland, the Ceres manager. “What we think would be revealed if Exxon were to conduct this assessment is that a large number of projects it has in the pipeline would not be economically viable,” she said. Cleveland cited the difference between projections in Exxon’s",

    "date": "2016-03-18T08:00:26-04:00",
    "content": "Veteran climate science deniers have joined the fight to block the Clean Power Plan, the heart of the Obama administration’s climate policies, attempting to convince an appeals court that supposed doubts about climate science should halt the Environmental Protection Agency’s rules to slow carbon pollution. Thirteen contrarian scientists, economists and professors, many with long-documented ties to fossil fuel industry groups and organizations committed to spreading doubt about climate change, are claiming the EPA’s carbon rules are “entirely based on scientific propositions that have been shown to be invalidated by highly credible empirical data.” “This brief is simply a recitation of the climate change denier myths, falsehoods and half-truths that have long-been debunked. It is beneath the dignity of our courts to even have to consider such nonsense,” said Michael Mann, a professor of meteorology and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. “I suspect that, to the extent the court does consider this document, it will be viewed as exhibit A in the case for intellectual bankruptcy of industry-funded climate change denialism,” he added. The Clean Power Plan aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and is the cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s efforts to combat climate change. The challenge to the rules, brought by more than two dozen states and their industry supporters, currently rests in the hands of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Supreme Court issued a surprising stay of the plan in February while the litigation runs its course. The climate contrarians asked the court to “step back from its past approach” of relying on the international scientific consensus that global warming is happening and is caused by human activity. Their brief asks the court to “take a hard look at whether there is truly any credible proof that, in the real world, rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations impact global temperatures to a measurable degree. At this point, there certainly seems to be no such proof.” Many of the scientists have signed onto similar briefs in other cases in the past, to no avail. John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, said the scientists involved are not qualified to assess projections about climate change. Abraham is a co-founder of the Climate Rapid Response Team, a group of scientists who try to correct the record when denialists present their version of the science. “Many of the signers are not climate scientists at all, have not published anything in climate change, in some cases have published very little, and in other cases have made past predictions that were shown to be incorrect,” Abraham said. These scientists reject out of hand the EPA’s finding that carbon dioxide poses a danger to the environment. The agency reached that decision after the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case Massachusetts v. EPA in",

New solar policy guidelines released last week begin to deliver answers. For the first time, a national overview is available via the “Low-Income Solar Policy Guide,” jointly produced by the nonprofit groups GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar and the Center for Social Inclusion. It explains the myriad challenges, benefits and opportunities for low-income families who go solar. Policymakers, nonprofits, companies and community organizers are all looking for ways to improve solar access, said one of the report’s authors, Sean Garren, a regional manager at Vote Solar. “We pulled together the guide to try to catch this wave of interest and provide them the resources they need to turn it into concrete expanded access in low-income communities,” he said. But even as solar is expanding and getting cheaper, few options for buying or leasing solar panels are affordable for low-income families, Stan Greschner, vice president of government relations and market development at GRID Alternatives, told InsideClimate News. “The number one issue is cost,” said Greschner, noting that families don’t have $15,000 to drop on a solar panel investment, or even the smaller deposits needed for leasing or renting panels. They also probably don’t have strong enough credit to qualify them for such programs.

    "title": "Outcry Prompts Dominion to Make Coal Ash Wastewater Cleaner",
    "date": "2016-03-10T15:21:48-05:00",
    "content": "Dominion Virginia Power agreed this week to adopt stricter standards than Virginia requires for treating coal-related wastewater before it is dumped into local waterways, bowing to pressure from environmentalists and local officials. The settlement comes after activists and others challenged the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality‘s (DEQ) approval of permits for Dominion to treat and dispose of wastewater from open-air ponds containing coal ash, a byproduct of burning coal, at its Bremo and Possum Point power stations. Those activists, along with politicians and environmental experts, have raised objections to the company’s treatment-and-disposal plan, arguing that Virginia requires coal ash wastewater to go through far less thorough cleaning than neighboring North Carolina does. For example, Dominion’s permit for Bremo Power Station set the company’s maximum threshold for arsenic, a known carcinogen, at 530 parts per billion; Duke Energy’s Riverbed Steam Station permit, issued by North Carolina regulators, has an arsenic threshold of 72 parts per billion. On Monday, 35 frustrated college students occupied the lobby of the DEQ building in Richmond. After several hours, police cited the 17 activists who still remained for trespassing. The gap between North Carolina and Virginia standards is expected to narrow under the new agreements. Environmentalists at the James River Association negotiated on March 7 with Dominion to update Bremo’s disposal plan; the next day, officials from Prince William County, Va., held parallel discussions with Dominion to revise Possum Point’s disposal process. “The water will be a lot cleaner once it leaves Bremo Bluff than it would have been if nobody had challenged the permit,” said spokesman Mike Mather of the Southern Environmental Law Center. The group represented the James River Association in the settlement. “Both agreements highlight the commitment that [the James River Association] and Prince William County, respectively, hold for protecting the quality of their rivers. Dominion shares that commitment,” Dominion spokesman Dan Genest wrote in an email to InsideClimate News. Virginia environmental regulators praised the deal, and specifically commended Dominion for voluntarily going beyond state and federal statutes, according to DEQ spokesman William Hayden. Some of the Dominion ponds targeted in the permits are decades old. Seven of the eight are unlined, meaning the waste has likely leached into the surrounding soil and groundwater. As part of the pond closure process, more than 480 million gallons of waste will be treated and dumped into local waterways. Waste from Possum Point will go into Quantico Creek, which empties directly into the Potomac River. Bremo’s waste will dump into the James River, 130 miles upstream from where the river connects with the Chesapeake Bay. Dominion has not yet received permits for handling the sludge left at the bottom of these ponds once all the water is removed. Under both settlements, Dominion has agreed to use equipment that will absorb more heavy metals out of the wastewater. With the James River Association, Dominion will also conduct fish tissue studies around Bremo to ensure the waste treatment is working to protect fish. According to the deal with Prince William County, Dominion will provide $50,000 for the county to hire independent consultants to review the Possum Point permit. Doubts Persist Despite Settlement Many opponents of Dominion’s plan, however, say the fight is not over. Maryland’s Department of the Environment and Department of Natural Resources, along with the state attorney general’s office, announced in February their intention to appeal Dominion’s Possum Point permit. Responding to the Prince William County settlement, Maryland officials told InsideClimate News they would review the agreement but that they are still planning to appeal. Maryland regulators are targeting Possum Point because it is located only a couple hundred feet from the Virginia-Maryland border along the Potomac River. That means its waste disposal will affect both states. Members at the grassroots environmental group Potomac Riverkeeper Network filed an appeal of the Possum Point permit on Feb. 26. “The multiple appeals from environmentalists, and state and local governments, forced Dominion to come to the table. That by itself speaks volumes about the DEQ lax permit,” Dean Naujoks from Potomac Riverkeeper Network said in a statement on Wednesday. Naujoks said his group, however, would continue its appeal, pushing the company to embrace even stricter disposal standards. Dominion has also come under fire recently for releasing 27.5 million gallons of untreated coal ash wastewater from Possum Point into Quantico Creek last year; the company admitted in January that it had happened, but said the disposal was allowed under the company’s old permit. Environmentalists aren’t convinced. The Potomac Riverkeeper Network has alerted the Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigative Division of the incident; the agency has not yet said publicly if it will open an investigation. Prince William County resident Paul Simpson said he doubts Dominion’s commitment to the recent agreement. “[They] just don’t have my trust and I don’t think they have many people’s trust,” he told InsideClimate News. Simpson farms oysters in Virginia and dreams of making it a full-time job. He’s concerned about how the waste could harm aquatic life. Prince William is the second largest county in the state, with about 440,000 people. In the wake of a devastating",

Such action is considered standard procedure, according to former federal prosecutors who say the response appears ambiguous as to what action may be taken by the FBI. “As a courtesy, we have forwarded your correspondence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),” said a letter to the congressmen from Peter J. Kadzik, an assistant U.S. attorney general. “The FBI is the investigative arm of the Department, upon which we rely to conduct the initial fact finding in federal cases. The FBI will determine whether an investigation is warranted.” The Justice Department’s referral letter to the FBI, however, has not been released, so it is not known if it contained any specific instructions. The referral was made to the assistant director of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. The FBI and Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. DeSaulnier said he would have preferred a more aggressive response, though the DOJ’s position did not surprise him. “I would very much like the attorney general to get involved and I think it’s inevitable that will happen because of the growing recognition of how the public was misled,” he said in an interview with InsideClimate News. Even if the FBI invests minimum effort in a due diligence inquiry, DeSaulnier said he thinks the facts will prompt a deeper investigation. “I will continue to make the argument there is too much compelling evidence not to hold companies accountable,” he said. Lieu said he believes the letter is a signal from DOJ to the FBI to begin a preliminary investigation. “They [DOJ] could have just said ‘thank you’ or declined to get involved,” Lieu said. “It makes sense in a case this complex that you would want the investigative arm of the Justice Department involved.” The congressman said he believes there is enough on the public record for the FBI to conclude a full-blown investigation is justified. “There is substantial evidence to support a full investigation and prosecution,” he said. Even if the FBI does not investigate thoroughly, DeSaulnier said more heat is being applied to Exxon and the industry, with an investigation underway in New York and probes being considered in other states, including California and Maryland. “There is going to be a moment of judgment both politically and legally,” he said. “I think a moment of judgment will be quite critical of the fossil fuel industry in terms of obfuscating the scientific facts and for not adhering to their moral and legal responsibility to the public.” Exxon declined to answer questions about the Justice Department’s letter. John Marti, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota, called the Justice Department’s response a “punt.” “The department appears to be reluctant to engage in this matter,” Marti said. “They are being careful to remain neutral.” Yet at the same time, he said, the letter puts the FBI in the position of seemingly requiring at least a rudimentary review of the issues raised by the congressmen. That review could consist of nothing more than reading the news stories detailing Exxon’s climate research and its history of sowing doubt about the science to performing a detailed inquiry, he said. He said he would expect the FBI to proceed cautiously. “They are not going to be excited over what they may perceive as a dispute over public policy as opposed to violations of federal criminal laws,” Marti said. Lieu and DeSaulnier, both Democratic members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in their letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch requesting an investigation that they were “alarmed” by the possibility that Exxon withheld vital climate change information and tried to discredit the science confirming global warming. The congressmen made their request for a federal probe following disclosures in an InsideClimate News series that Exxon scientists were warning of potentially catastrophic effects of a buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuels as early as",

    "title": "MIT Won’t Divest, but Students End Protest After Compromise",
    "date": "2016-03-03T14:59:51-05:00",
    "content": "Four months of student protests demanding fossil fuel divestment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ended on Thursday, when school administrators and members of the student group Fossil Free MIT announced a compromise. The agreement gives students a role in crafting and tracking the university’s climate policy, but the university did not budge on its refusal to partially divest MIT’s $13.5 billion endowment of its holdings in fossil fuel companies, which was a major goal of many of the protesters. Maria Zuber, MIT’s top administrator of climate policies and vice president for research, praised the agreement. “I think this is MIT at its very best,” Zuber told InsideClimate News. “We have different points of view on tactics, but all of us agree on the importance of addressing climate change, and we sat down in typical MIT fashion and talked extensively about it and found common ground together on this problem.” As part of the deal, MIT is creating a climate action advisory committee to advise Zuber on how the university should measure and track on-campus climate efforts, such as greenhouse gas reduction initiatives, as well as off-campus campaigns, including its correspondence with industry research partners on combatting climate change. The committee will include a mix of students, faculty, postdoctoral researchers, staff, alumni and members of MIT’s board of trustees. Students celebrated the compromise and vowed to keep pushing the issue. “While this agreement isn’t perfect, it’s a step in the right direction,” said Benjamin Scandella, an MIT graduate student in earth sciences and a student activist. “Fossil Free MIT must and will continue to be involved in implementing this agreement to make sure it … lives up to the magnitude and urgency of the climate challenge,” he said. The deal marks the end of a 116-day sit-in involving about 100 students, faculty, alumni and other community members, who took turns occupying a hallway outside the office of MIT President L. Rafael Reif. Between October and December, the sit-in proceeded around the clock. Students took a two-week break between Christmas and New Years, resuming the protest from January to March with reduced hours—from 6 am to 11 pm. The sit-in started in response to MIT publishing its long-awaited plan for how it would address climate change on Oct. 21. The plan rejected divestment from fossil fuels to the dismay of activists, and instead laid out a policy of engagement with fossil fuel companies that fund and collaborate on research with MIT. The university said it would pressure them to adopt policies to support the United Nations’ 2-degree Celsius global warming temperature target. The plan offered no specifics on how it intended to make that happen. Some of these companies have a history of leading climate misinformation campaigns, such as ExxonMobil. The students wanted more aggressive and specific actions, according to MIT student Geoffrey Supran, who helped organize the sit-in. They did not support Exxon using MIT “as a paintbrush to greenwash its climate lies,” he told ICN. When asked about the progress of engaging with industry on climate so far, Zuber said it is working. “Everything that has happened since we released the report has underscored to me that we’ve made the right decision. And I’m personally already seeing evidence that engagement is working.” Zuber said the MIT administration has started to talk with industry members about whether they have business plans that align with the school’s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. According to Zuber, all the companies they’ve talked to “either have or are working towards” such business plans. She would not disclose the names of the companies in these discussions. As part of the agreement with students, MIT administrators, students and others will develop specific benchmarks for tracking the success of the school’s engagement policy. The school will also publish an annual report detailing the process. Scandella said he and the other student activists support the administration’s plan but will continue to urge divestment, he said. MIT’s climate goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on the campus in Cambridge by 32 percent by",

    "date": "2016-03-07T08:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "The energy created by giant ocean swells that pound America’s coastlines could theoretically provide almost all the electricity the nation needs. But financial and technology troubles have thwarted any commercial project from tapping the clean energy source. A Department of Energy competition is trying to change that. Nine finalists for its Wave Energy Prize were named last week, ranging from startups and university labs to established companies. Proposed projects include barges on the ocean surface and bobbing buoy-like devices to air bags tethered to the sea floor. The submerged series of air bags in one team’s entry are compressed by waves. As the wave squeezes one bag, it sends air to another and cranks a turbine, harnessing the energy. The goal is to push at least one of these ideas from experiment to commercialization. “The prize targets the development of small scale prototypes that can be tested under apples-to-apples conditions,” said a Department of Energy spokesperson. “The goal of the prize is to halve the current [levelized cost of electricity] of wave energy by doubling the state-of-the-art performance of devices, to put wave energy on a quicker path to commercialization.” The finalists get $125,000 each in seed funding to build a 1:20 scale model of their installations. Whether and how well their systems perform over the next several months will determine which teams get to test their devices at the U.S. Navy’s Maneuvering and Seakeeping Basin in Carderock, Md. in July. Three winners, to be announced November, will receive grants of $1.5 million for first place, $500,000 for second and $250,000 for third. The money will be used as seed capital to build demonstration projects. The technologies will be judged on “average climate capture width per capital expenditure”—or simply, how much it costs per meter to build relative to how much power it generates. This is the first year the DOE has offered a prize for wave energy. The contest continues a long tradition of using prize money to solve the world’s vexing problems. In",

    "date": "2016-03-07T21:00:59-05:00",
    "content": "Three members of Congress have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Shell Oil Co. violated securities laws by failing to adequately disclose material business risks from climate change. Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by California Democrat Ted Lieu, said in a letter to the SEC that Shell understood the consequences of climate change and made business decisions based on that knowledge. “Yet, Shell funded and publicly engaged in a campaign to deceive the American people about the known risks of fossil fuels in causing climate change,” the lawmakers said in their letter to SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White. “As a publicly traded company, Shell has a duty to follow U.S. securities law … including disclosure requirements as they apply to business or legal developments relating to the issue of climate change,” the lawmakers said in the letter. “Unfortunately, it appears that Shell may have omitted or misrepresented material information in official filings.” The call for an SEC probe of Shell is similar to an earlier demand that securities regulators investigate ExxonMobil. There has been a rising chorus of demands from lawmakers, presidential candidates, environmental activists and climate scientists for federal inquiries into whether Exxon’s actions and communications on climate change violated U.S. laws. InsideClimate News reported last week that the Justice Department referred a request to investigation Exxon to the FBI’s criminal investigation unit. Shell spokeswoman Natalie Mazey and SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns both declined to comment. The letter to the SEC cites investigative reporting by InsideClimate News and later by The Los Angeles Times reporting on early research into climate change by Shell, Exxon, Texaco and other fossil fuel companies. Based on information from the news stories, Shell “intentionally obfuscated the role of fossil fuels in influencing climate change,” according to the letter signed by Lieu and fellow Democrats Matthew Cartwright of Pennsylvania and Peter Welch of Vermont. As an example of Shell’s awareness of climate change and its impacts on the company’s business, the congressmen’s letter cites a Los Angeles Times report that Shell announced in",

    "title": "Warren Buffett Delivers Cold-Blooded View of Global Warming to Shareholders",
    "date": "2016-02-29T17:34:35-05:00",
    "content": "As Warren Buffett spelled out to his investors over the weekend, the billionaire’s attitude toward climate change is not really laissez-faire, but rather one of sang-froid. He can’t be accused of doing nothing. But at the same time, his aplomb can seem a little too chill. In his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett, a master investor with an aversion to risk, had this to say about addressing global warming: “Inaction now is foolhardy. “Call this Noah’s Law. If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.” But his letter falls short of endorsing the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is already a major problem and that the world should quickly bring carbon dioxide emissions to zero, leaving most fossil fuel reserves in the ground. “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet,” he wrote. “I say ‘highly likely’ rather than ‘certain’ because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most ‘experts’ about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.” As a cold-blooded investor, Buffett seems driven simply to make money the way a cat catches mice, whether it is black or white. His railroad is making money even while the market for coal—one of the main commodities it hauls—is collapsing. He is one of the biggest suppliers of renewable energy in the nation, even as one of his utility companies fights to reverse net metering policies that encourage people to supply their own solar while staying connected to the grid. And Buffett assures shareholders who are asking for more complete disclosure of the climate risks facing Berkshire Hathaway that its insurance business, for example, can cope with climate damages by raising premiums. That means he sees insurance becoming more profitable even as the seas rise and as drought, wildfire, famine and pestilence spread. “As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights,” he writes. “As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.” This “what, me worry?” analysis extends equally to his companies like insurance or railroads that face policy or technology risks related to climate change, and to his companies that face non-climate risks, like newspapers or retailers. “Let me mention just a few examples,” he writes. “To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, is certain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future—though not, in my view, for a long time—GEICO’s premium volume may shrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our auto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for when purchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storage capabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers and certain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us—but even the most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.” Buffett, though, is not a stubborn advocate of business as usual. One holding, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), “has invested $16 billion in renewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the 4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is six times the generation of the runner-up utility. “We’re not done,” he wrote. “Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables in support of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, both for the environment and for Berkshire’s economics.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2016-03-01T07:00:40-05:00",
    "content": "Communities facing rising sea levels are likely to see the cost of flood damage increase faster than water levels, concludes a new study. Three scientists in Germany made this sobering conclusion while developing a new analysis tool to help coastal communities worldwide understand and calculate the estimated economic costs of rising sea levels driven by climate change. So far, the investigation of flood-related damages has lagged behind studies on sea level rise, said Jürgen Kropp, one of the study authors and a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. This new study, published Monday in the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, comes on the heels of two related climate papers. One found that the current rate of sea level rise is the fastest on record for at least the last 28 centuries. That study, by researchers from seven institutions including Potsdam, was published last week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The other, by scientists at Climate Central, concluded that the coastal flooding of American towns and cities will continue to intensify in the future due to manmade global warming. “For decision makers, it’s important to know what the expected costs [of coastal flooding] will be for the future”—not just how much sea levels will increase, said Kropp. This new analysis underscores that urgency, showing “damages rise much faster than sea levels,” he said. U.S. communities already feeling the impact of, and responding to, sea level rise have probably already figured this out or wouldn’t find the results surprising, flood expert Chad Berginnis told InsideClimate News. But for rest of the country, “it could be a very surprising conclusion,” said Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers who did not participate in the study. According to Kropp, the new study analyzes how to estimate the economic costs for a certain level of flooding from sea level rise in a particular year. While such analyses have already been developed for specific cities, such as New York, they aren’t easily replicable, explained Kropp, which is where this study comes in. In the paper, researchers analyzed Copenhagen (estimated pop. 560,000). They used an estimate of flooding-related damages in the city of $1.2 billion a year in",

Residents who sign up to lease a rooftop solar system through this initiative will not have to pay a deposit or go through a credit or background check, some of the biggest barriers to going solar for many low- and moderate-income families. The solar leasing costs—initially $20 a month, in some cases—are likely the lowest currently available in the state, and the country. “It’s stellar,” said Rev. Carl McCluster of the Shiloh Baptist Church in Bridgeport, one of the churches participating in the program. “In communities where there are low-income households like Bridgeport and like most urban areas…sometimes you are stretched to make ends meet.” Credit checks and deposits are often impossible for these families, he said. McCluster is also the managing director of the national network of religious groups called Faith Restoration Empowerment & Economic Development Outreach Ministries, Inc., or FREEDOM. For this solar offering, FREEDOM members in Connecticut teamed with the solar provider PosiGen and Connecticut Green Bank, an organization devoted to growing local clean energy and climate-friendly opportunities. In the coming weeks, FREEDOM members will host informational sessions about the solar program to their communities.

    "title": "Aliso Canyon Released 97,000 Tons of Methane, Biggest U.S. Leak Ever, Study Says",
    "date": "2016-02-25T19:01:00-05:00",
    "content": "The leak from Southern California Gas Co.’s Aliso Canyon storage unit totaled 97,100 metric tons of natural gas, making it the largest release of uncombusted methane in U.S. history, according to a peer-reviewed study published Thursday in the journal Science. SoCal Gas, however, joined two other California utilities in telling state regulators that there is no established method for estimating methane releases in catastrophic gas-system failures. That filing on Feb. 17 incensed environmental groups including the Environmental Defense Fund and drew a rebuke from one of the Science study’s lead authors. “I’m going to call bullshit on that,” said Stephen Conley, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Davis. The study, mostly funded by SoCal Gas, used measurements of methane concentrations taken from an airplane flying downwind from the leak to calculate the volume of leaked gas. Determining the amount of leaked methane, the primary component of natural gas, has important financial and climate implications. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, 84 times more potent at warming the earth’s atmosphere over 20 years than carbon dioxide. On Jan. 6, Gov. Jerry Brown ordered SoCal Gas to pay for climate mitigation efforts equal to the total volume of methane emitted. The leak went on for 3½ months until the well was capped on Feb. 11. Conley cited several ways of calculating the volume of leaked gas. One is the method he and his colleagues used, measuring downwind methane concentrations and factoring in things like wind direction and wind speed. A second method would have required adding an easily detectable chemical to gas in the storage facility before it escaped from the leaking well, he said, but SoCal Gas had not added that chemical. Another option is for SoCal Gas to measure the volume of gas left in its storage facility and compare that with the amount there before the leak, adjusting for volumes injected and withdrawn since the emissions began. In a letter to Timothy Sullivan, executive director of the California Public Utilities Commission, SoCal Gas senior vice president Jimmie Cho indicated on Jan. 22 the company has at least some knowledge and capacity to measure its Aliso Canyon inventory. The gas company said in a press release on Jan. 6 it would comply with the governor’s order to mitigate the climate effects. “SoCal Gas reaffirms our prior commitment to mitigate the environmental impact of the actual amount of natural gas released from the leak,” it said. In a joint filing by SoCal Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Southwest Gas Corp., on Feb. 17, the companies said, “In the event of catastrophic pipeline failures, the Joint Utilities are not aware of any established methodology that could be used to determine the release of methane.” In response to questions from InsideClimate News, SoCal Gas spokeswoman Tammy Taylor said in an email, “The statement refers to the fact that there is no generally agreed upon method to measure emissions from catastrophic events. It does not mean that the amount of natural gas emitted from the Aliso Canyon incident, or other catastrophic events, cannot be measured.” The language in the filing nonetheless angered environmentalists who have called for greater transparency in reporting methane emissions. “They continue to say they are going to make it right, they are going to mitigate the emissions,” said Timothy O’Connor, director of the Environmental Defense Fund’s California oil and gas program. “But where the rubber hits the road they use purposeful arguments to backtrack and undercut what they have said in the public.” EDF, which helped bring attention to the leak with infrared camera footage that captured the magnitude of the emissions, filed a response Wednesday to the gas utilities’ joint filing. “The Joint Utilities also make the claim that they are ‘unaware of any established methodology used to determine the release of methane,'” EDF said in the document. “However, this point seems inaccurate insofar as SoCal Gas has funded, and thus is aware of, the measurements taken by airplanes, towers and satellites at Aliso Canyon. Similarly, this purports to run counter to express statements of SoCal Gas that they themselves can measure the size and will mitigate the catastrophic leak at Aliso Canyon.” In a separate filing Wednesday, the utility companies said, “Establishing a methodology for measuring emissions from such unusual events is challenging and unique, as ARB [the California Air Resources Board] has recently recognized in discussing the limitations of the aerial surveys over the Aliso Canyon storage facility.” The reference was to a preliminary estimate on Feb. 22 of greenhouse gas emissions by the California Air Resources Board based on Conley’s flight data. The data “can be used to develop a very rough estimate of the total methane leaked to date,” the agency said on its website. “Once completed, the estimate calculated from these data will be the most robust quantification of the overall leak.” Conley’s Science study estimated the amount of methane released into the atmosphere from the Aliso Canyon reservoir between Oct. 23, when the leak was detected, and Feb. 11, when it was plugged. The rate of leaked gas, up to 60 metric tons of methane an hour, was comparable to the emission rates of entire oil and gas production regions. For example, production in the Barnett shale region of Texas emits 76 metric tons of methane an hour, and the Haynesville shale region in northwest Louisiana and East Texas, emits 80 metric tons an hour, according to the study. “If you look at this leak on a global scale, compared to worldwide methane emissions, it’s a drop in the bucket,” Conley said. “But if you look at it compared to other individual leaks, it’s a monster. It’s the biggest leak in U.S. history.” Conley and his colleagues calculated the leak volume by measuring methane concentrations and meteorological data on weekly flights through the emissions plume, including an otherwise restricted flight zone immediately surrounding the leak. The California Air Resources Board contracted the work. SoCal Gas paid for 11 of the 13 flights. Conley, who has measured leaks from the oil and gas industry by plane since",

    "date": "2016-02-26T11:00:25-05:00",
    "content": "EDITOR’S NOTE: An earlier version of this article has been amended to reflect Exxon’s comments on the Paris climate accord and other regulatory issues. ExxonMobil’s annual report to stockholders this year may be more noteworthy for what the fossil fuel giant didn’t say about global warming than for what it did say. In the document’s legally mandated discussion of risks to the business, Exxon didn’t disclose that the New York State attorney general is investigating whether the company violated shareholder and consumer protection statutes in its communications about climate change over almost four decades. The company did for the first time mention climate change in connection with preparedness for natural disasters. Legal academics and representatives of shareholder groups have criticized the company for failing to discuss the New York probe. Environmental groups, presidential candidates, lawmakers and climate scientists have been urging the Justice Department and state attorneys general to investigate what Exxon knew about global warming and what it told shareholders and the public. Exxon showed little indication in its 10K annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is changing course on global warming. “What we have is a corporate circling of the wagons, heads in the sand,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at the Vermont Law School. Exxon may have exercised allowable discretion in remaining mute on the New York investigation, according to Michael Gerrard, a professor of environmental law at Columbia University. Exxon may have concluded that being served a subpoena did not meet the threshold for legal action it needed to disclose or that it yet posed a material threat to its finances, he said. “If the investigation leads to a lawsuit being filed seeking monetary penalties, that would add a new factor that would need to be considered in determining whether there is a disclosure obligation,” Gerrard said. “For an extraordinarily large company like Exxon, potential losses have to be quite substantial to materially affect their bottom line.” Exxon spokesman Alan T. Jeffers said the company complied with SEC disclosure requirements, including not divulging information when the “liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote.” The SEC did not respond to a request for comment. Investigators for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a subpoena in November demanding a mountain of records on the company’s history of climate research and its conduct concerning climate change. Before the probe came to light, InsideClimate News had published a series of investigative stories that revealed Exxon’s little-known history of conducting rigorous climate change research from the late",

More than 100 geoscientists are calling on the American Geophysical Union to drop ExxonMobil as a sponsor of its annual earth science conference in response to the company’s years of spreading climate denial views. The call appeared in an open letter posted Monday morning on a science website called The Natural History Museum. The oil giant Exxon has a history of funding organizations that perpetuate climate misinformation and try to thwart policies that address climate change—in direct conflict with the earth science association’s mission and funding policies, the scientists said in their letter to Margaret Leinen, president of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). “AGU has established a long history of scientific excellence with its peer-reviewed publications and conferences, as well as a strong position statement on the urgency of climate action,” the letter said. “But by allowing Exxon to appropriate AGU’s institutional social license to help legitimize the company’s climate misinformation, AGU is undermining its stated values as well as the work of its own members,” it added. Leinen responded in a post on AGU’s blog. “The AGU Board of Directors will take up the questions raised in this letter at their upcoming meeting in April, and prior to that will carefully review the information that has been provided, and any additional information that becomes available in the meantime,” Leinen wrote.

The industry’s inability to cut production could have a profound impact on the climate as well as corporate bottom lines. Despite reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across Canada, continued tar sands oil production will most likely keep the nation from meeting targets it set as part of the international climate accord agreed to in Paris.

    "title": "Maryland Attorney General Suggests His Office May Investigate Exxon, Too",
    "date": "2016-02-24T08:00:55-05:00",
    "content": "In response to a petition calling for an investigation of ExxonMobil, Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said his office will “hold accountable any individuals and corporations who have intentionally contributed” to climate change. Frosh made the strongly worded statement in an email to people who signed an online petition calling on his office and 15 other attorneys general to probe Exxon in connection with the company’s history of climate denial. While Frosh didn’t say an investigation is underway, some environmental activists and elected officials from other states said his wording suggested he is poised to take on the oil giant. “There is some very specific language—’intentionally contributed’—in his statement that lawyers don’t use unless they are serious about an issue,” said R.L. Miller, co-founder of Climate Hawks Vote, one of the organizations behind the petition. “I see that as a strong statement that his office is going to get involved.” Exxon is already the target of an investigation by the New York State attorney general’s office. In November, investigators for Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a subpoena demanding that Exxon turn over documents related to its climate change studies and how the company represented the information to the public. California Attorney General Kamala Harris, another Democrat, has also been under pressure to probe Exxon. Legal experts say Exxon could be accused of violating shareholder and consumer protection statutes. “I welcome any attorney general who joins the fight,” Schneiderman said after Frosh issued his statement. Exxon and other oil companies have an obligation to ensure that their disclosures to investors about climate risks are truthful and not misleading, Schneiderman said. Frosh’s director of communications, David Nitkin, declined to elaborate on the statement. “He believes it speaks for itself, about his concern about the issue,” Nitkin said. When asked whether Frosh is pursuing an Exxon investigation, he said, “This office does not comment on or confirm the existence of any investigations.” “Thank you for signing the MoveOn.org petition on climate deception. There is no doubt that climate change is an existential threat to our society and to our entire planet. Like you, I am deeply troubled that oil companies have contributed to the problem by intentionally promulgating misleading information, testimony and advertising. The Maryland Office of the Attorney General will continue to look for ways to address climate change, and to hold accountable any individuals and corporations who have intentionally contributed to it.” —Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh Exxon officials declined to comment. The petition by MoveOn.org and Climate Hawks Vote is one of several online appeals across the country to investigate Exxon and other fossil fuel companies. It was launched in the wake of an investigative series by InsideClimate News that revealed the company was aware of the potentially catastrophic consequences of rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide associated with the burning of fossil fuels, yet it chose a path casting doubt on that science and funding denial groups. “American citizens in every state of the nation are suffering from the damages of Exxon’s unlimited greenhouse pollution,” the petition says. “Every attorney general’s office should use all of the tools at their disposal to prosecute Exxon’s deliberate deception.” Frosh, a 69-year-old first-term Democrat, said he has “no doubt that climate change is an existential threat to our society and to our entire planet.” “I am deeply troubled that oil companies have contributed to the problem by intentionally promulgating misleading information, testimony and advertising,” he said in the statement. “The Maryland Office of the Attorney General will continue to look for ways to address climate change, and to hold accountable any individuals and corporations who have intentionally contributed to it.” The Maryland Senate this week voted overwhelmingly for a measure requiring the state to slash emissions 40 percent by",

    "date": "2016-02-25T09:00:39-05:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil has challenged a shareholder resolution that calls for the company to show how its business will be affected by the global commitment to dramatically slow global warming. The resolution—filed by the New York State comptroller’s office and four co-filers—also seeks an explanation of how Exxon will address those impacts. Exxon notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it wants to block a vote on the proposal at its annual meeting in May. The fossil fuel giant argued that it’s unlikely that strict emissions restrictions will be imposed to meet the goal of holding global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius that world governments agreed to in last year’s Paris climate accord. By challenging the resolution, Exxon positioned itself as an outlier in the oil industry’s growing acceptance of the consequences of burning fossil fuels and the urgency to halt global warming, some industry analysts said. The SEC recently denied a request by AES Corp., a generating company in Virginia, to block a similar shareholder resolution. “It’s a little bit like a toddler putting their fingers in their ears and saying if I can’t hear you then what you’re saying isn’t true,” said Shanna Cleveland, manager of the Carbon Asset Risk Initiative at the nonprofit sustainability advocacy group Ceres. Exxon’s position signals that while nearly 200 countries around the world agreed to the Paris accord, Exxon remains on the sidelines, she said. Exxon investors have filed a series of shareholder resolutions seeking to reform the company’s climate change policies, including appointing someone to the board who is in tune with climate issues and for the company to take moral responsibility for climate change. The company is challenging other climate-related resolutions, including the moral responsibility proposal. Stockholders have been urging Exxon to confront the threat of climate change for decades. They have fought to have the company invest in renewable energy, cut harmful emissions and perform carbon risk assessments. Yet the company has regularly rejected shareholders’ requests and dismissed their concerns. The New York comptroller’s resolution was filed in concert with the Church of England’s investment fund, the Vermont State Employees’ Retirement System, the University of California Retirement Plan and the Brainerd Foundation. “ExxonMobil risks becoming an outlier among its peers who have publicly supported reining in climate change,” New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said in a statement after Exxon challenged the proposal. “As investors, we need to know how ExxonMobil’s bottom line will be impacted by the global effort to reduce emissions and what the company plans to do about it.” Exxon declined to comment, saying its position is clear in SEC filings. The SEC did not respond to a call for comment. In its SEC filing, Exxon argued that the resolution was vague and demanded facts and figures that would be hard to derive. The SEC will most likely issue its ruling before Exxon sends proxy materials to shareholders later this spring. In a letter to the SEC, the shareholders argue that the Paris agreement is an urgent call for action that will affect regulatory policy, technological progress, consumer demand for energy—and ultimately the way Exxon conducts business. “As the profound implications of a warming world resonate with global policymakers, and a credible path to action has been initiated, the need for companies to provide reliable information on the financial risks and opportunities associated with climate change has only been underscored,” the shareholders’ letter said. “Investors require clear, transparent, and comparable information about climate change impacts to make informed assessments about their use of capital.” In its resolution, the group said the assessment “should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2-degree target.” Exxon told the SEC that the 2-degree goal renders the resolution vague and indefinite. “The meaning and implications of the term are not explained and would be understood only by persons with significant scientific knowledge gained outside the text of the Proposal and supporting statement,” according to Exxon’s letter to the SEC. In AES’s bid to block a similar resolution, the SEC rejected the company’s argument that the proposal was too vague. “We note that the proposal focuses on the significant policy issue of climate change,” the SEC said in a letter to AES. “Accordingly, we do not believe that AES may omit the proposal from its proxy materials.” Other fossil fuel companies, including Shell and BP, have agreed to publicly describe how they will be affected by lower greenhouse gas emissions. Exxon declined to join ten major oil and gas companies last year in support of policies consistent with a 2-degree goal. “The issue of living in a 2-degree world isn’t going away,” said Tim Smith, senior vice president of Boston-based Walden Asset Management, which promotes environmental, social and corporate responsibility on behalf of investors. “The company is facing a huge amount of reputational risk in terms of climate,” Smith said. “By going to the SEC to try to prevent their investors from having a debate and a vote on the 2-degree world, they are continuing to dig a hole that harms their image and positions them as outcasts in the discussion of global warming.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2016-02-12T18:18:25-05:00",
    "content": "One hundred and eleven days after a massive gas leak was first detected, the leaking well was temporarily plugged at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. Southern California Gas Co, which owns and operates the large, underground gas storage unit, announced on Thursday that a relief well it started digging in early December had pierced the leaking well near its base, more than a mile and a half beneath the surface. Pumping heavy drilling fluids into the well stopped the flow of gas. Along with that news, however, came a filing by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission that stated the company may have continued pumping gas into the leaking storage facility for two days after the leak was first discovered on October 23. Pumping additional gas into the underground reservoir increases its pressure, which in turn increases the leak rate. A prior press release from the company did not clarify when injections into the well ceased, saying only that they began to draw down the volume of gas in the facility on October 25. “Currently, there are no gas injections into the storage field, and withdrawals have taken place since October 25 to reduce the reservoir pressure.” The filing, published on Thursday, also said significantly more households have been relocated by SoCal Gas than the company published in a recent press release. That press release issued Wednesday said 4,645 households had been relocated by the company. The company’s SEC filing said “approximately 6,400 households utilized temporary relocation services.” In its SEC filing, SoCal Gas added that it will continue preparations to drill a second relief well until it is confident that the leak has been permanently sealed, “which at this point is not assured.” The leak has so far cost the company between $250 and $300 million and has resulted in 67 lawsuits filed against the company. Some of the suits have also targeted SoCal Gas’s parent company, Sempra Energy, according to the filing. Independent, real-time monitoring of methane emissions in Porter Ranch, a neighborhood of northwest Los Angeles approximately one mile from the leaking well, suggests the temporarily plug is holding but that methane levels are still slightly higher than normal. “There is no evidence that the leak is going on, but there are above ambient levels that might include [small leaks from] the other 7,000 miles of pipe that are up in that whole mountain system,” said Robert Crampton, senior scientist at Argos Scientific, a company that",

    "title": "In Latest Blow to Solar Users, Nevada Sticks With Rate Hikes",
    "date": "2016-02-15T11:00:36-05:00",
    "content": "Nevada utility regulators dealt their latest blow to the state’s solar industry on Friday, refusing to reconsider their recent decision to gradually erase the state’s popular solar credits. Regulators did, however, decide in a 3-0 vote to give solar users more time to adjust to the new rules, slowing the phase-in of the credit reductions from four to 12 years. Solar advocates were disappointed by the regulators’ decision, which they said dims the future for the rooftop solar industry in Nevada. “We are profoundly disappointed by the actions of the Public Utilities Commission…More than 17,000 Nevada households who installed solar panels under programs promoted and supported by the State and the [Public Utilities Commission] remain stranded by today’s decision, and thousands more will be denied the opportunity to produce their own power in the future,” Chandler Sherman, a spokeswoman for the solar provider SolarCity, said in a statement Friday. Last December, regulators at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (PUC) passed some of the most extreme solar rate hikes and credit cuts in the nation. State officials also took the unprecedented—and highly unpopular—step of applying those changes to both new and existing solar users. Other states that have recently passed solar credit reductions, such as California, Arizona and Hawaii, have grandfathered, or exempted, existing users from the policy changes for 10-20 years. It didn’t take long for the state’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, along with a Nevada homeowners association and several solar groups, to petition regulators to reconsider the rules. Solar users, workers and activists spoke at the latest meeting in Las Vegas, urging regulators to review the solar policies, or, at the very least, exempt the state’s existing solar users from the rule changes for up to 20 years. Activists delivered about 55,000 comment cards that similarly criticized the changes. But the commissioners unanimously rejected the petitions to reconsider all the rules as well as the grandfathering rule. Exempting existing solar users from the credit cuts would “create harm to the 98 percent of ratepayers in the state that don’t have solar on their homes,” Paul Thomsen, chairman of the commission, said during the meeting. But he also acknowledged that implementing the changes over only four years would harm solar users. The fairest solution, the commissioners decided, was to triple the phase-in time of the solar changes, a solution Commissioner David Noble proposed in a draft order issued before the meeting. Activists and members of the solar industry have since voiced their disapproval of the modified rules, which they say make solar less affordable for new customers and many existing ones, too—and means certain death for the state’s once burgeoning rooftop solar industry. Nevada’s governor also spoke out against last week’s decision. “While I have respected the Commission and its deliberations by not influencing its process, the PUC did not reach the outcome I had hoped for,” Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, said in a statement. “I remained optimistic that the Commission would find a solution that considered the economic consequences to existing rooftop solar owners. Today’s decision does not go far enough to protect their interests.” NV Energy, the utility most affected by the new rules, has not yet commented on the recent decision. However, the power company had come out on Jan. 25 in support of exempting its thousands of existing solar customers from the new rules for 20 years. NV Energy’s request for new rates and credit changes for solar customers helped prompt the utility regulators to review the state’s solar policies in the first place. Traditional power companies, whose profits have suffered as more people have gone solar, have often argued that the incentives mean solar users do not pay their fair share of costs to maintain the grid. The rule modification does not impact the first set of rate and credit changes that took effect on Jan. 1. In Nevada, the monthly bill for a typical homeowner with rooftop solar panels has already increased from $12.75 to $17.90; the homeowner’s credit for energy returned to the grid has decreased from 11 cents per kilowatt-hour to 9 cents. Under the updated rules, the full rate change goes into effect in",

After Scalia died last week during a hunting trip, the Supreme Court may feel his absence for a year or more, as Republicans in the Senate resist approving a successor chosen by President Barack Obama. And partly because of two coincidences, Scalia’s death is putting pending decisions on climate change and other environmental questions in sharper relief than ever. No analysis of the environmental stakes missed the first coincidence: that Scalia’s vote just a week before he died had tipped the balance of the ideologically divided court in an ominous direction for President Obama’s climate policies. The court’s conservative Republican appointees, with a 5-4 vote, pushed through an unprecedented stay of Obama’s most important climate regulation, the Clean Power Plan, until all judicial reviews are exhausted.

    "content": "Sign up to receive our latest reporting on climate change, energy and environmental justice, sent directly to your inbox. Subscribe here. One big unknown clouds the aftermath of the Los Angeles County methane disaster: the health effects for thousands of people living nearby who were exposed to the gas while it leaked for three and a half months. People from 600 households near the leak at the Aliso Canyon gas storage unit reported headaches, nosebleeds, nausea and other symptoms to county officials as thousands were evacuated from their homes. It isn’t known which, if any, toxic chemicals in the natural gas may have caused the symptoms, or whether there will be long-term health ramifications, according to environmental scientists. “We’re dealing with a gap in the science,” said Michael Jerrett, professor and chairman of the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. “We just don’t have a very good scientific understanding of what that means for long-term health effects.” Southern California Gas Co. permanently sealed the leaking well at its underground gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon Thursday after bringing it under temporary control last week. The leak persisted for more than 100 days after it was discovered Oct. 23, producing the same impact on the climate over the next 20 years as the emissions from more than seven coal-fired power plants, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. No one has been able to make a similar estimate of the health effects. In response to a query about the long-term health effects of the leak, SoCal Gas cited a Jan. 31 report by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, an agency it is collaborating with to address health concerns related to the leak. The report concluded, “the average levels of benzene and other trace chemicals that have been measured in the community are currently at or below levels seen elsewhere in the county, and do not pose an increase in the risk of short‐term or long‐term health effects.” Independent scientists, however, said not enough is known about the long-term effects of short-term exposures to certain compounds that were released from the gas reservoir. The potentially troublesome chemicals include benzene, a known carcinogen; hydrogen sulfide, which can affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems; and n-hexane, a neurotoxin. Elevated levels of each of those chemicals were recorded soon after the leak was detected, but the extent of the exposure is difficult to determine because of the limited air monitoring conducted at the time. SoCal Gas did not begin monitoring the air until Oct. 30, a week after the leak was detected. The South Coast Air Quality Monitoring District, the air pollution control agency for much of southern California, took its first samples on Oct. 26. Most health officials have attributed the reported symptoms to mercaptans, a class of odorants that are added to natural gas to make leaks easier to detect. State and county officials say mercaptans have not been associated with long-term health effects. However, mercaptans aren’t known to cause nosebleeds. Nearly a third of the 600 households near Aliso Canyon that registered complaints of health effects reported bloody noses, according to a Los Angeles County public health survey published last week. What’s more, only about half as many households, or 17 percent, reported smelling the mercaptan odorant. “The high prevalence of reported nose bleeds and low prevalence of reported odor are noteworthy, however, and somewhat inconsistent with expectations,” according to the report. “Additional testing may be warranted to investigate these observations further.” “I don’t think we can say definitely that mercaptan was the only reason for the health effects,” Jerrett said. “I’ve been scouring the literature, and I can’t seem to find any evidence that mercaptan causes nosebleeds.” The literature includes a state and federal epidemiology study of a",

    "date": "2016-02-11T10:00:52-05:00",
    "content": "California proposed new regulations to curb methane from the oil and gas industry last week, adding momentum to a state and federal push to reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. If enacted, California’s rules would be the strongest in the country, outpacing similar efforts from the Obama administration and several other states, said Dan Grossman, an expert on state oil and gas programs at the Environmental Defense Fund. The regulations would require regular inspections for leak detection and repair, and apply to many parts of the supply chain including storage facilities, processing plants, wellheads and related equipment. The rules for underground storage are particularly important, given the ongoing leak at the Aliso Canyon storage facility in Los Angeles. The leak, now spewing methane for three and a half months, prompted the evacuation of thousands of residents, mostly from the affluent Porter Ranch neighborhood. David Clegern, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board (the agency behind the proposed rules), said the methane released so far from Aliso Canyon is equal to half a percent of the state’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. Clegern said the new methane rules weren’t inspired by Aliso Canyon. They’ve been in the works for years, he said, and grew out of AB32, California’s landmark climate change law that passed in",

    "content": "Most public middle and high school science teachers in the United States are devoting two hours or less per course to the topic of climate change —and they are often getting the facts wrong, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science. While three out of four teachers are teaching the issue, only half of those instructors are correctly explaining that humans are driving climate change. An even smaller number of teachers are aware of how overwhelming the scientific consensus on the issue is. These findings appear in a landmark study that involved a comprehensive national survey of public school science teachers for the first time. It asked if and how they are talking to students about climate change. The results come as at least 16 states are adopting a new science curriculum (the Next Generation Science Standards) that tackles climate change more directly and in greater depth. The study was conducted by researchers from Penn State University, Wright State University in Ohio and the California-based nonprofit National Center for Science Education. They concluded that teachers aren’t getting enough training on climate science—and they are being influenced by the politicization of the subject outside of school. “The fact that 75 percent of teachers are covering this issue at all shows teachers are interested in the topic and they find it important,” lead author Eric Plutzer told InsideClimate News. “Many of them personally believe the burning of fossil fuels is causing warming, but are not aware that view is shared by climate scientists. That lack of awareness surely contributes to the willingness to [entertain] alternatives and non-scientific views in their classrooms,” said Plutzer, a political science professor at Penn State. Multiple studies have shown an overwhelming percentage of climate scientists—97 percent or more—agree that climate change is being propelled by human activity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its fifth, and latest, report it is “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” Yet just over half of U.S. adults believe that scientists are in consensus about the human contribution to climate change, according to a",

Cornell’s decision falls into the trend of Ivy League schools continuing to be noticeably absent from the movement to divest from fossil fuel holdings. That movement has rapidly expanded to include hundreds of individuals, state college systems, public pension funds, big banks and more, with combined assets worth at least $3.4 trillion. Cornell became the latest of the Ivies to decline when it announced that decision on Jan. 29. “The university’s endowment must not be regarded primarily as an instrument of political or social power; its principal purpose is to provide income for the advancement of the university’s educational objectives,” said Donald Opatrny, chairman of the school’s investment committee. Cornell, located in Ithaca, N.Y., has a student population of nearly 22,000. Still, Cornell officials said that they would consider divestment when a company’s actions or inactions are “morally reprehensible.” By choosing not to divest in any fossil fuel companies, the officials indicated they don’t believe those companies qualify for such an extreme label. They did point out other ways the university is tackling the climate issue, however, such as through making buildings on campus more efficient. By saying it did not want to politicize its endowment actions, Cornell echoed Harvard University’s announcement rejecting divestment in October",

    "date": "2016-02-08T16:20:07-05:00",
    "content": "Federal regulators say they may propose safety rules as a response to the three-and-a-half-month methane leak in California, but the rules may not address two key issues that turned Aliso Canyon into a disaster: emergency shutoff valves and a safer configuration of pipes. Last week, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it may issue its first safety regulations for storage sites like Aliso Canyon. The agency also urged operators to voluntarily follow guidelines developed by the industry itself. Those guidelines don’t require systems to stop the flow of gas in an emergency or include redundancies to isolate the methane from the environment. Adoption of the industry guidelines would probably do little to prevent a similar disaster at the 418 similar storage units across the country, according to pipeline safety and environmental groups. The ongoing release of methane—a potent greenhouse gas—from Southern California Gas Co.’s Aliso Canyon storage unit has forced thousands of people to evacuate because of health concerns. “Once again, the industry has got out ahead, drafted the regulations, and now PHMSA , which hasn’t done anything for years, is going to incorporate these recommended practices as the regulation,” said Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit based in Bellingham, Wash. “So once again, it’s industry designing their own regulations.” Lax regulation may have played a role in the Aliso Canyon leak, according to environmentalists and California lawmakers fashioning a response to the crisis. Nearly a year before the leak was discovered Oct. 23, SoCal Gas told state regulators of aging, corroding, leak-prone wells at the Aliso Canyon facility, but proposed repairs have not begun. There is little federal oversight for the storage of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, a potentially explosive fuel. More than 100 facilities like Aliso Canyon that aren’t part of the interstate gas network are governed by a patchwork of state regulations. In California, multiple agencies have some responsibility for underground gas storage, with no designated lead authority, according to state lawmakers. Even if PHMSA imposes new regulations, storage units would most likely remain under state jurisdiction, though state authorities may adopt any new federal rules. More than 230 storage units that are part of the interstate gas network fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of PHMSA, but it has always deferred to state agencies in regulating the underground part of such facilities. In its advisory to the industry last week, PHMSA cited two sets of guidelines developed by the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, and one from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC), an intergovernmental group led by state oil and gas regulators. One set of API guidelines pertains to gas storage in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, like those in Aliso Canyon, and depleted aquifers. The two other sets of guidelines pertain only to salt caverns. Depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers make up 91 percent of gas storage facilities nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. The API published its guidelines for depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers in September",

FEMA is also now requiring state governments to incorporate climate change into their disaster mitigation strategies or risk losing out on billions of dollars of federal funds. The agency also helped develop new flood risk policy that mandates all federally funded projects—including FEMA ones—located in a floodplain be built higher and stronger than previously required. Nimmich spoke alongside Richard Spinrad, the chief scientist for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Major General Robert Livingston of the South Carolina National Guard at an event hosted by the Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington, D.C.

    "content": "Oil giant ExxonMobil moved to reject a shareholder proposal calling for the company to assert moral leadership on climate change and pledge to work toward limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less. In a letter to securities regulators, the company said the resolution filed by a faith-based organization is “vague and indefinite.” Exxon also said it’s unnecessary for shareholders to consider the proposal at the annual stockholders meeting on May 25 because the company has already taken steps to tamp down global warming. The resolution was filed by the New Jersey-based Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment. While social responsibility groups have been demanding action on climate change from Exxon for decades, the Tri-State resolution is the first to call on the company to acknowledge moral responsibility. Over the past 25 years, shareholders have submitted 62 climate change-related proposals to Exxon, according to an InsideClimate News review of shareholder resolutions. Of those, 22 were either withdrawn or blocked by the company. None of the remaining 40 got enough votes to pass. Management often urges the Securities and Exchange Commission to bar shareholder proposals from the proxy statements they publish for annual investor meetings. Sister Patricia Daly of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell, N.J., one of the sponsors of the resolution, called Exxon’s move “arrogant and dangerous.” “This challenge demonstrates that ExxonMobil plans to continue to cling to an unsustainable paradigm that severely harms our planet, without reflecting on the moral dimensions of a ‘business as usual’ scenario,” she said. “I wonder what management fears will be revealed if they allow this resolution to go to a vote. “They don’t see the moral imperative,” she said. “They are dodging the 2 degrees.” The resolution declares, “We believe that ExxonMobil should assert moral leadership with respect to climate change.” It also calls on Exxon to adopt policies consistent with limiting the average global temperature increase to 2 degrees since the beginning of the Industrial Age and to acknowledge urgency in meeting that goal. The Tri-State Coalition represents nearly 40 Roman Catholic groups with pension funds that hold shares of Exxon. A spokesman for Exxon declined to comment.

    "date": "2016-01-27T04:01:42-05:00",
    "content": "Fearing a depletion of its emergency fuel reserve California regulators ordered Southern California Gas Co. to stop pumping all natural gas out of its Aliso Canyon storage facility, the main way it has been reducing the amount of methane escaping from a ruptured well. The drawdown has lowered the volume of leaking gas by 68 percent since emissions peaked Nov. 28, according to the California Air Resources Board, but regulators are now worried the effort might be tapping too much of Los Angeles’ emergency natural gas reserves. The leak has blown 4.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere since it was detected Oct. 23, according to state regulators, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, whose district includes a portion of the Porter Ranch neighborhood in northwest LA, said the regulators’ top priority should be stopping the leak. “There is only one thing that has been successful or partially successful so far, and that is SoCal Gas has drained the facility down to about 25 billion cubic feet of working gas,” Sherman said at a Porter Ranch town hall meeting Friday. “Efforts to reduce the pressure and reduce the leak are [now] going to stop. Not only is that an outrage for anybody who breathes air in the North San Fernando Valley, it is also a violation of the governor’s emergency order.” In a letter sent Friday, Sherman urged Gov. Jerry Brown to order the California Public Utilities Commission to comply with a provision in his Jan. 6 state-of-emergency declaration calling for maximum gas withdrawals to slow the leak. CPUC officials argued that they also have an obligation to ensure adequate gas supplies for heating homes and generating electricity. The dispute over the CPUC’s ruling last week spotlights the dilemma facing SoCal Gas and California policymakers over how to stop the runaway leak from the Aliso Canyon storage unit, now in its 96th day. The leakage has forced school closures and the evacuation of thousands from their of homes because of health concerns. Methane from the well equals the greenhouse gas emissions of burning more than 830 million gallons of gasoline, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. And yet the natural gas stored there is essential fuel for one of the largest urban areas in the U.S. Separately, well control experts who have been drilling a relief well to plug the massive, ongoing leak are within approximately 200 feet of their goal, the base of the ruptured well more than a mile and a half below ground. As engineers enter their final phase of drilling, progress will slow to ensure the relief well hits its target. The project is on schedule to intercept and attempt to plug the well by late February, SoCal Gas said in a statement. According to the company, 3,226 households have been relocated in nearby neighborhoods, and an additional 1,563 households are preparing to relocate. Schools in the area have closed after residents complained of nosebleeds, skin rashes, headaches and nausea. CPUC executive director Timothy Sullivan ordered SoCal Gas senior vice president Jimmie Cho last Thursday to stop the drawdown and maintain a working volume of 15 billion cubic feet of gas in the underground storage. The company was drawing gas from the facility through other, non-leaking wells and pumping it to customers. Previous efforts attempting to capture and burn the leaking gas ceased earlier this month after SoCal Gas decided the effort was too risky. “We have used our best efforts to develop and consider multiple plans to safely capture and process the gas,” SoCal Gas president and chief executive Dennis Arriola said in a Jan. 18 letter to Gov. Brown. “Unfortunately, none of the identified plans adequately address these safety risks to our satisfaction.” Flaring or otherwise burning the leaking gas would have significantly reduced residents’ health concerns and would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions because methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a much more potent greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide that is released when it is burned. Until the well is plugged, natural gas will continue to leak, though the rate of emissions depends on the volume and pressure of gas remaining in the storage facility. That’s what makes the decision to keep natural gas in the facility controversial. SoCal Gas views “that natural gas as an asset, while we in Porter Ranch know it’s a toxin,” Rep. Sherman said at Friday’s town hall meeting. In his letter to the governor, the congressman wrote, “Maximizing daily withdrawal from the storage facility is the only way to reduce pressure and thereby reduce the daily amount of the leak. Failure to withdraw natural gas from Aliso Canyon as quickly as possible creates unnecessary threats to public health.” Three environmental organizations also criticized the CPUC decision. In a joint statement on Jan. 24, the groups Save Porter Ranch, Food and Water Watch and the Sierra Club said the ruling is “threatening residents with further exposure to toxic emissions.” “It protects SoCal Gas’s assets, and it appears to violate Gov. Brown’s order to withdraw the maximum amount of gas from the field,” said Alexandra Nagy, Southern California organizer with Food & Water Watch. “SoCal Gas has been unwilling [to] protect residents because to drain its facility would harm its bottom line.” Gareth Lacy, deputy press secretary for Gov. Brown’s, said the Governor received Sherman’s letter and is reviewing it. In addition to calling for maximum daily withdrawals from the storage facility, Brown’s executive order also said, “The California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission, in coordination with the California Independent System Operator, shall take all actions necessary to ensure the continued reliability of natural gas and electricity supplies in the coming months during the moratorium on gas injections into the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility.” CPUC officials defended their decision to halt the drawdown when the working supply of gas reaches 15 billion cubic feet, a volume that SoCal Gas officials said may have already been reached. An estimated 16.4 billion cubic feet of gas remained in the storage facility as of Friday after accounting for gas lost through the leaking well according to a letter from SoCal Gas’s Cho to Sullivan of the CPUC. Well control specialists hired by SoCal Gas have been drilling the relief well since Dec. 4. Earlier efforts to stop the leak by pumping heavy fluids and drilling mud into the top of the well failed. The relief well has now entered the cap rock, a layer of impermeable rock at the top of the storage reservoir about 8,400 feet underground, according to SoCal Gas and California Department of Conservation officials. About 200 feet now separate the relief well from the leaking well. When they reach it, engineers plan to fill the well near its base, first with heavy fluids and drilling mud and then with cement to permanently seal it. Progress on the final stage of drilling will still take weeks, as operators have to alternate between drilling and sending an electromagnetic probe to ensure the relief well intercepts the leaking well. But the drilling equipment has to be retracted before the probe can be sent down, an exchange that can take up to a day according to SoCal Gas. As of Monday, drilling had stopped for 48 hours as operators waited for newly installed cement lining the relief well to cure, according to California Department of Conservation spokesperson Don Drysdale. “This final phase requires precision and accuracy, which takes time,” SoCal Gas said in a said in a statement. SoCal Gas was ordered Dec. 10 by the California Department of Conservation to begin drilling a second relief well in case plugging efforts with the first relief well do not succeed. Drilling of the second well is expected to start Feb. 8, Drysdale said in a statement. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2016-01-25T19:41:48-05:00",
    "content": "State regulators ordered Southern California Gas Co. to permanently close and seal the well adjacent to the Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los Angeles that’s spewing methane and sickening local residents. They also called for enhanced air-quality monitoring in the vicinity and an independent study of potential health effects from the well’s emissions. The state agency, however, did not order the shutdown of the Aliso Canyon underground natural gas storage facility that the leaking well taps in its ruling on Saturday, as environmental groups had demanded. The Sierra Club, Food and Water Watch, and Save Porter Ranch, an environmental group in the northwest LA neighborhood closest to the leak, sharply criticized the decision by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) as not going far enough. “SCAQMD’s failure to put Californians’ livelihoods first is shameful, and Gov. Brown should intervene swiftly,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a joint statement from the three environmental organizations. “There should be no other choice but to shut down the dangerous Aliso Canyon facility and look to close every urban oil and gas facility throughout California and our country, to ensure the health of our communities and our climate is never again sacrificed for corporate polluter profits.” Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency on Jan. 6, months after the massive leak was discovered Oct. 23. The ruptured well has emitted almost 88,000 metric tons of methane from one of the largest natural gas storage sites in the U.S. That’s the greenhouse gas equivalent of burning nearly 830 million gallons of gasoline, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Well control specialists hired by SoCal Gas are drilling a relief well to plug the leak, an effort the gas company said should be completed by late February. Thousands of Porter Ranch residents have evacuated and schools have closed since the leak began. Hundreds of residents reported symptoms including nausea, headaches and dizziness. California regulators attribute the symptoms to mercaptans—sulfurous chemicals that are added to natural gas to aid in the detection of leaks. Some health experts are skeptical, however, because there’s virtually no research on prolonged exposure to mercaptans, and trace amounts of benzene, toluene and other known toxins associated with the leaked gas have also been detected. An independent board appointed by SCAQMD voted to issue Saturday’s abatement order after hearing testimony from more than 100 residents and elected officials. The order calls for SoCal Gas to fund continuous air monitoring. SCAQMD and SoCal Gas have conducted air monitoring since the leak began, but not continuously, drawing criticism from outside experts.. The health study ordered by the agency will include any potential effects from exposure to mercaptans and other odorants added to the gas. The abatement order also called for continuous monitoring of the ongoing leak with an infrared camera until 30 days after the leak has stopped. Infrared cameras and other monitoring equipment have shown plumes of methane gas, which are invisible to the naked eye, blowing across nearby communities, but no known effort to continuously monitor the plume has been attempted. The hearing board also called for the development and implementation of an enhanced leak detection and reporting program for all of the roughly 115 wells at the storage site. Brown’s state of emergency declaration requires the state’s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission to submit a report assessing the long-term viability of natural gas storage in California. Aliso Canyon is one of 14 underground natural gas storage areas in the state and supplies 21 million customers in Central and Southern California, according to SoCal Gas. The report is due six months after completion of an investigation of the cause of the Aliso Canyon leak. “These gas storage fields can’t disappear overnight, or there would be impacts to actually heating our homes, turning on the lights, etc.,” Wade Crowfoot, deputy cabinet secretary and senior adviser in the Governor’s office, said at a community meeting in Porter Ranch Jan. 15. “But the state is committed to actually understanding what should be the future of Aliso Canyon. What should be the future of these storage wells? Is it feasible to shut Aliso Canyon down? Is it feasible to shut other gas storage fields down? We’re very open-minded, all options are on the table, but it needs to be fact-based.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2016-01-14T11:00:22-05:00",
    "content": "Independent researchers reported detecting elevated methane levels as far as 8 miles from the massive, ongoing leak of natural gas from a storage site in northwestern Los Angeles. A ruptured well at Southern California Gas Co.’s Aliso Canyon underground facility has spewed more than 80,000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere since the leak was discovered Oct. 23. The release of the powerful greenhouse gas led to the evacuation of thousands of people from the affluent Porter Ranch neighborhood a mile from the leak after reports by residents of nosebleeds, rashes, headaches and nausea. Finding elevated methane levels well beyond the Porter Ranch area raises potential health concerns for people living outside the immediate vicinity of the leak, the researchers said. Inhaling low concentrations of methane, the primary component of natural gas, is generally not considered a health concern, but natural gas often contains trace amounts of other, more harmful gases. “Whatever else may be in the gas—benzene, toluene, xylene —that is what people may be breathing,” said Nathan Phillips, an earth and environment professor at Boston University. “Even though we’re not measuring things other than methane, there is a legitimate concern that there is that other nasty stuff in there.” The findings challenge assurances from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the regional air pollution control agency, and the state’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment that the leak hasn’t increased residents’ exposure to toxic gases. The cumulative methane emissions from the Aliso Canyon facility to date have the greenhouse gas equivalent on the Earth’s atmosphere of burning nearly 800 million gallons of gasoline, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. On Wednesday Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander called on SoCal Gas to extend its residential relocation program to residents of neighborhoods adjacent to Porter Ranch, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. People in these communities were also reporting similar symptoms related to the leaking gas, according to the paper. SoCal Gas spokeswoman Kristine Lloyd said the gas company is providing temporary accommodation and air filtration for residents within a five-mile radius of the leak, extending beyond Porter Ranch. Democratic U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California sent a letter to the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice Wednesday calling on the federal agencies to offer further assistance to the State of California in responding to the gas leak. In a mapping effort funded by the Home Energy Efficiency Team, a Cambridge, Mass., nonprofit, Phillips and Robert Ackley of Gas Safety Inc. measured methane emissions for the past several days near the Aliso Canyon leak. Gas Safety Inc. provides natural gas leak detection services to industry, businesses and homeowners. They used a laser-based system mounted to a car. It recorded methane concentrations and plotted the readings on Google Earth. On Tuesday and Wednesday the researchers drove further from the leak and recorded methane concentrations as much as two times higher than background levels, as far as 8 miles away from the site. (Click to view a large version of the Google Earth data visualization, seen above.) “It’s not just in Porter Ranch, it’s going all the way across the [San Fernando] Valley,” Ackley said of the methane plume. The valley is home to 1.8 million people including Northridge, Winnetka and Woodland Hills, neighborhoods across the valley where the researchers confirmed increased methane concentrations. California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment evaluated air samples collected by SoCal Gas in the Porter Ranch neighborhood between Nov. 1 and Jan. 9. The analysis included an assessment of benzene and other toxic chemicals and concluded that “available Porter Ranch neighborhood air sample data does not indicate that an acute toxicity health hazard exists in the Porter Ranch neighborhood as a result of the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak.” The agency said the symptoms reported by many Porter Ranch residents can be attributed to mercaptan, an odorant added to the otherwise odorless natural gas. Mercaptan smells like rotten eggs and helps in leak detection. “These odors can evoke physiological responses (e.g. nausea, headaches) without inducing more serious or longer-lasting health effects, such as eye, or respiratory system damage,” the office said. Independent scientists, however, questioned those findings. The “acute” guideline is “the most cautious interpretation you could take,” Michael Jerrett, the chair of the UCLA Department of Environmental Health Sciences, told the Los Angeles Daily News. Acute guidelines focus on health effects from breathing significantly elevated levels of benzene over a short period but don’t assess the health effects of inhaling lower levels over a longer time. “There’s a potential here for health effects that could be experienced long term,” Jerrett told the paper. Phillips made the same point. “We are going in for a half hour at a time to check out the plume, but if I had that as a constant condition in my place of work or home, I would definitely be concerned about it,” Phillips said. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment’s analysis was based on measurements that were collected twice daily. “One thing I was most struck by was the inadequacy of once or twice a day sampling stations,” said Robert Jackson, an earth system science professor at Stanford University who joined Phillips and Ackley in taking methane readings over the weekend. “There is an array of a dozen sampling stations that sample gases once or twice a day,” Jackson said. “The area needs more real-time continuous sampling.” There should also be additional sampling locations outside the Porter Ranch neighborhood, he said. The South Coast Air Quality Management District has taken 24-hour readings on six days in Porter Ranch since Dec. 21. “The benzene levels are actually on the low side of what we see typically in the LA area,” said Sam Atwood, spokesman for the air quality district. “They were all 0.1 parts per billion with the exception of one, which was 0.2 parts per billion. Typically we would see anywhere from 0.1 to 0.5 parts per billion. That’s good news. We’re not seeing elevated levels, at least in these continuous 24-hour samples.” Phillips disputed the characterization of low levels of benzene and other toxic compounds. “They are documented carcinogens,” Phillips said. “You really can’t say there is a safe level.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "In a crushing loss for Nevada solar users, state utility regulators voted 3-0 on Wednesday evening to keep a solar policy that may be the most controversial in the nation. Starting Jan. 1, Nevada’s more than 17,000 residential and small-scale commercial solar users were hit with higher electricity rates, coupled with reductions in the credits they receive for sending their unused solar energy back to the grid. The state Public Utilities Commission had approved these changes less than two weeks before, astonishing and angering the solar industry and customers. The backlash has been swift and intense. Customers have balked. Major solar installers, including Sunrun and SolarCity, announced they were ceasing local operations, closing offices and cutting hundreds of jobs. Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who appointed the regulators, tried to distance himself from the decision. The controversy has spread even to the presidential campaign, where two Democratic contenders have criticized the decision. Bernie Sanders called it “just about the dumbest thing I have ever heard.” More recently, Hillary Clinton said, “I don’t think any change in rules should penalize people who were permitted and encouraged to do what folks have done” in Nevada. Nevada is among a handful of states that have repealed incentives aimed at encouraging residential-scale solar and other forms of distributed generation, part of a push by some utilities and fossil fuel interests to fight the spread of renewable power. The leading industry trade group Edison Electric Institute has called customer-owned distributed energy a “disruptive challenge” to the control utilities have over America’s electricity supply. What particularly rubbed people the wrong way in Nevada, however, was abandoning the concept of “grandfathering.” When other states, including Arizona and Hawaii, increased rates for their solar customers or rolled back credits, they did so for new customers; existing customers were grandfathered into existing policies. Nevada changed the rates across the board. Defying the request of solar advocates, Nevada regulators announced their decision on Dec. 22 to approve immediate rate and credit changes for both future and existing solar customers. Those rates will increase, and the credits will decrease every year until",

It is a concrete measure toward leaving fossil fuels in the ground, as the science demands. But it was the invisible hand of the coal markets, not the inexorable thrust of the climate models, that ultimately drove the federal government to this point. Coal companies have been going bankrupt, even as they have been granted access to a virtually limitless resource at almost negligible prices. So the federal government, as the steward of the public patrimony, could no longer justify business as usual. “The business partnership between the federal government and the coal industry no longer works,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), which has long criticized federal coal leasing practices. “It became apparent that the industry does not have a strategy for moving forward in the face of a shrinking market.” The market realities opened the door to a review that, if it ends up imposing climate accountability on the coal industry, could lock up huge quantities of carbon fuels for decades to come. Environmental advocates cheered the announcement. “This is a historic decision that greatly improves the world’s chances of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change,” said Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth. “With this decision President Obama sent a clear signal to coal companies, and their investors, that the days of dumping their pollution onto the American public are ending.” The moratorium will have no immediate impact on the supply or demand for coal, even though coal produced from federal lands accounts for 40 percent of all domestic production. The Obama administration has already approved leases providing billions of tons of coal, and the amount already available to the industry that hasn’t been dug up is “enough to sustain current levels of production from federal land for approximately 20 years,” the Interior Department said on Monday. Those contracts are not being broken. But new leases, such as two pending offers that would have made another 640 million tons of Wyoming coal available, will be suspended. The policy review is expected to last more than three years, well beyond President Barack Obama’s term in office. Republicans, vehemently opposed to what they call his “war on coal,” are guaranteed to rally to the industry’s side, along with some Democrats from fossil fuel-producing states. “This announcement is the manifestation of a misguided ‘keep-it-in-the-ground’ policy that will harm local economies and threaten future energy supplies – while doing little to promote innovation or transparency,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who chairs the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources committee. Administration officials denied the move was merely an attack on coal. “Even as our nation transitions to cleaner energy sources, building on smart policies and progress already underway, we know that coal will continue to be an important domestic energy source in the years ahead,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a conference call. “We haven’t undertaken a comprehensive review of the program in more than 30 years, and we have an obligation to current and future generations to ensure the federal coal program delivers a fair return to American taxpayers and takes into account its impacts on climate change.” How the government eventually addresses the climate costs of the leasing program is what will determine whether the review will have the powerful and lasting impact that environmental advocates are seeking. For years, government auditors and Congressional critics have said that at the very least, the royalty fees on coal should be raised to provide a fair return to taxpayers. But how much would it have to go up to reflect environmental costs as well? “The short answer is there is no short answer,” Jewell said. But she said it was no longer appropriate to run a program on the principle that the goal was basically to “get as much coal out of the ground as possible.” Federal coal leases produce as much greenhouse gases each year as 161 million cars, according to a recent study by the Wilderness Society and the Center for American Progress. Those in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana alone account for 10 percent of U.S. emissions. Coal production also has other environmental impacts, such as local pollution, destruction of wildlife habitat, and the like. Any policy that reflects coal’s climate costs in its market price would further disadvantage the ailing industry in its competition with other, cleaner energy sources, such as natural gas or renewables. The administration has calculated that the full social cost of carbon – a rough estimate of how much environmental damage from climate change will eventually cost, expressed in today’s dollars per ton of carbon dioxide emissions – to be nearly $40 a ton. Other economists say the true cost is far higher than that. Dan Utech, a top White House climate advisor, said it is premature to declare whether the social cost of carbon would be reflected in revised royalty fees. Shaun Donovan, director of the White House budget office, said that the administration recognized that climate change is already causing “billions of dollars of costs to taxpayers,” and that the new policy was meant “to reflect the true cost across the board.” The formal order launching the review of the leasing program said that along with accounting for environmental costs and getting taxpayers a fair return, addressing recent changes in the coal market was a crucial concern. Pro- and anti-coal advocates have urged the administration “to take these significant market changes into account, although the recommended changes vary,” the document said. “Some suggest that the program should attempt to improve the economic viability of the coal industry and help coal-dependent communities by reducing royalties and streamlining the leasing and permitting processes. Others raise concerns that the program has contributed to low coal prices by incentivizing over-production through non-competitive sales that oversupply the market.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "Against the backdrop of the historic Paris climate treaty last month and in the face of mounting calls for sweeping investigations of the company, ExxonMobil investors have filed a series of shareholder resolutions seeking to reform the company’s climate change policy. Stockholders are demanding more transparency this year from the global oil giant over how much it spends on lobbyists and organizations dedicated to obfuscating climate science and opposing emission regulations designed to slow climate change. They want Exxon to pledge to comply with measures to hold global warming under the 2-degree Celsius limit set by the Paris accord, and they want the company to add climate-conscious board members. Two resolutions proposed for the annual shareholders meeting May 25 would ask the company’s board to disclose information about its public policy advocacy. One was filed by the Needmor Foundation, a social justice organization based in Ohio, and a similar one by the United Steel Workers of America. The proposals are among seven climate-related resolutions that shareholders hope will make it to a vote. “We believe there is a broad cross-section of investors who are concerned about the ways oil and gas companies are using their power and influence to oppose forward-looking policies on climate,” said Tim Smith, senior vice president of Boston-based Walden Asset Management, a company that promotes corporate responsibility on behalf of shareholders. While all seven proposals may not make it to a vote, this year’s crop of resolutions continues a 25-year campaign by activist shareholders to get Exxon to confront the threat of climate change. Investor groups have fought to have the company invest in renewable energy, cut harmful emissions and perform carbon risk assessments. Exxon has regularly rejected shareholder requests, and no climate change resolution has been adopted. In",

    "title": "Coal’s Decline Sends Arch into Bankruptcy and Activists Aiming for Its Leases",
    "date": "2016-01-12T20:00:51-05:00",
    "content": "Arch Coal, the nation’s second-largest coal mining company, filed for bankruptcy on Monday to help shed more than $4.5 billion in debt. It throws into question the company’s current and pending projects and its effects are expected to ripple across the entire beleaguered industry. It is the largest coal company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, following Alpha Natural Resources in August. Patriot Coal also filed for bankruptcy in May—for the second time in three years. The bankruptcies come as little surprise, given that coal production has sunk to its lowest level in nearly three decades, driven mainly by federal environmental regulations and increasing competition from natural gas and renewable energy. Coal prices dropped precipitously last year. The announcement from Arch Coal, however, has particular implications for the future of America’s coal leasing program and critical infrastructure projects, from railroads to coal export terminals. The company has pending applications to lease at least 65,000 acres of federal lands for mining, a bid for more than 40 miles of rail extension, a 38 percent stake in the proposed coal export terminal in Longview, Wash., as well as 11 coal mines. When a company as large as Arch Coal declares bankruptcy, “I think it’s a clear indication that coal is certainly on its way out. And I think it’s an indication this nation needs to get serious about making sure this transition happens as quickly and as orderly as possible,” said Jeremy Nichols, climate and energy program director for WildEarth Guardians, a Denver-based conservation group. According to Nichols, this should signal federal regulators to reject the company’s pending applications for permits for new coal mines and coal mine extensions on federally owned land. For now, Arch Coal’s permit for a new Colorado lease remains under review, and the company has already asked regulators at the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management to put its Wyoming lease applications on hold, according to Jessica Kershaw, an Interior Department spokeswoman. Kershaw said she did not know of a case in which regulators denied a coal company’s permit application because of a bankruptcy filing, but she said officials do consider whether a company can maintain an active operation during the application process. WildEarth Guardians sent a letter to Arch chairman and chief executive John Eaves on Monday asking him to withdraw all the company’s pending federal coal lease applications, among other steps, to reduce the company’s liability. “If Arch were to obtain these leases, the company faces at least $703 million in financial commitments, although likely higher, a sum that it cannot currently afford. It seems absurd to believe that the company now or in the future could shoulder such liability,” the activists wrote in the letter. The group also recommended Arch Coal relinquish its federal coal leases in Wyoming, at sites where no coal production is currently taking place—as well as commit to paying for the eventual cleanup and rehabilitation of land it is currently mining. Ending the leasing of coal on public lands has become a target of environmental groups, including WildEarth Guardians, because it is one of the federal government’s biggest carbon-polluting programs. Arch Coal did not respond to a request for comment. But in a statement on the company’s website, the company said it plans to continue operating as usual. “Our mining operations and customer shipments will continue in the ordinary course throughout this court-supervised process,” it said. “Today’s announcement represents another significant step in our ongoing efforts to position the company for long-term success,” Arch Coal’s Eaves said in a separate press release. The decision came after the company reached an agreement with most of its significant lenders. The process involves restructuring the debt of the company, which has about 5,000 employees. The move “sends a signal to investors: don’t go near coal and that’s a good thing,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

    "title": "SOTU: Obama Vows to Revamp Federal Coal Leasing Program",
    "date": "2016-01-13T06:20:53-05:00",
    "content": "President Obama pledged on Tuesday to push for changes in how the federal government manages fossil fuel development on public lands, an emerging battleground in the nation’s climate policies. In the final State of the Union message of his presidency, he spoke at some length of the climate crisis, and derided those who deny the problem’s severity. But his words were mostly a recitation of past accomplishments and familiar ambitions. There was no laundry list of bold programs and budding proposals this time. But his call to “accelerate the transition away from dirty energy” did signal an emphasis on revamping hotly disputed programs, notably those for the leasing of coal reserves at low prices. These are being challenged because they sustain the production of high-carbon fuels that scientists say must mainly be left in the ground in order to avoid the worst risks of global warming. “That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal reserves, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet,” he declared. Although he offered no particulars, clean energy campaigners seized on the words as the latest sign that the administration wants to increase the price that mining companies pay for coal. “It’s time to not only reform our fossil fuel leasing program, we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground,” said Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth, in a statement. “The issue of fossil fuel extraction on public lands is going to be a key fight over the coming months,” said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org. Because longstanding federal statutes call for a balancing act by federal land managers in how they develop and conserve the national patrimony of natural resources, Obama has considerable leeway in setting policies on leasing and similar management strategies. Environmental groups have already mounted a campaign in court to challenge rock-bottom prices charged for some fossil fuels. At a time when parts of the coal industry are on the brink of collapse, there’s a sharp argument over the economic repercussions of any changes. Obama’s speech sought to put this fight in the context of broad changes during his administration, and to depict them as mostly favorable economic developments. “In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal —in jobs that pay better than average. We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy — something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth,” he said. “Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either.” But cheap gasoline, appealing as it may sound to ordinary people, is troublesome both to those who want to keep on drilling and to those who would prefer to discourage profligate driving in newly affordable gas-guzzlers. Similarly, when Obama boasted that in his two terms the nation has “reinvented our energy sector” he could be cheered both by solar advocates and fracking fans—but not lawmakers from coal states, who sat stolidly through his discussion of climate change. Obama made sure there was no mixed message on the matter of climate science, though—the underpinning of his policy agenda. “When the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there,” he said, in what was probably the night’s most pointed barb. “Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it,” he went on. “You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "The lengthening list of Americans calling for more investigations of ExxonMobil Corp.’s behavior on climate change includes members of Congress, three presidential candidates, dozens of climate scientists and Glenda Poliner, a San Diego grandmother. She was one of almost 9,000 people who signed a petition calling on California Attorney General Kamala Harris to investigate whether Exxon misled the public on global warming. Poliner, a schoolteacher who says she has a second grandchild on the way, included a note to Harris, a Democrat. “I almost told my daughter to not have children because they would be facing a steadily deteriorating world because of the actions of companies such as ExxonMobil,” she said in the note. “These companies must be held accountable for their misdeeds. Please continue to do everything in your power to reverse this devastation.” From the halls of Congress to the campaign trail to households across the nation, there is a roiling call for federal and state prosecutors to probe what Exxon knew about climate change and whether it broke consumer and shareholder protection laws in what it communicated to the public. Petitions and other public demands for investigations follow the publication of investigative stories by InsideClimate News and other news organizations that showed Exxon was at the forefront of global warming research decades ago until it launched campaigns to cast doubt on climate science and delay action. Exxon is already the target of a probe by the state attorney general in New York, though the inquiry was opened months before the nationwide clamor for action began. Investigators for Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed Exxon records last month spanning four decades of research findings and communications about climate change. “We’re not just shouting this into the wind,” said R.L. Miller, president of the political advocacy group Climate Hawks Vote. Her organization called on U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and California’s Harris to open probes into Exxon. Miller, a California environmental activist who is influential in the Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, said she expects the party’s California candidates for the U.S. Senate, including Harris, to make an investigation of Exxon part of their platform. Doing so would play a “very, very big part in the committee’s decision on who to support,” Miller said. More than a dozen environmental and activist groups have mounted petition drives, including CREDO, the California League of Conservation Voters, Climate Hawks Vote, MoveOn, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Avaaz and 350.org. “We’re not surprised that Exxon lied about climate change,” says a petition aimed at the U.S. Department of Justice that was fashioned by 350.org and circulated by a number of groups, including Climate Hawks Vote. “We’re not even surprised they lied for so long. What’s dismaying is that they just might get away with it.” So far that petition has collected 355,000 signatures. The California League of Conservation Voters petition signed by Poliner has attracted 8,934 supporters since Nov. 20. A petition orchestrated by the Union of Concerned Scientists has drawn 12,500 signers since Dec. 11. Exxon declined to respond to questions. A spokeswoman for Harris said the office does not comment on possible investigations. The U.S. Justice Department as a matter of policy “generally neither confirms nor denies whether a matter is under investigation,” spokesman Mark Abueg said in an email. “We suggest seeking clarification from the company and if it is willing to provide additional details,” Abueg said. Public demands for action and petition drives—no matter how impassioned—typically have little influence on how prosecutors proceed, said former California Democratic Attorney General Bill Lockyer, though such calls are never completely off the radar for elected officials. “Prosecutors make decisions based on the best available facts, not on public opinion,” Lockyer said. “But they have to remain open to listening. Now whether that goes from listening to prosecutorial action is another question.” Although the calls for investigations may not carry legal sway, they are raising social consciousness, said Stephen Mulkey, president of Unity College in Maine, which calls itself “America’s Environmental College.” “There is so much awareness now about the conduct of Exxon that it is making it increasingly unlikely they can continue business as usual,” said Mulkey, who led a successful effort to get the college to join with other educational institutions in selling fossil fuel investments such as Exxon stock. Even if Exxon is never hauled into a court of law, it faces a guilty verdict in the court of public opinion, Mulkey said. “The voice of the public can be very powerful,” Mulkey said. “They are saying it’s time to take a stand.” U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, was one of the first to call for an Exxon investigation. Others doing so in Congress include Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, a California Democrat, and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat. Lieu, a former military prosecutor who is in his first term in the House, said that while investigators must act independently, the pressure being brought to bear is vital because it signals a national will to take action. He said he feels an obligation to the people of his Southern California district to press for an investigation. “I believe one of my duties is to yell and scream on behalf my constituents,” Lieu said. “When things go wrong—and it is very clear to me that things are wrong with Exxon—I have a moral obligation to speak as loudly as I can to bring light to the issue.” Lieu’s two sons—Brennan, 12 and Austin, 10—are part of his motivation, he said. “We have a moral obligation to make sure we give a world to our children that is better than we have now,” he said. “This is about the future as much as it is about the past.” That’s the message Lieu said he believes will resonate with those empowered to hold Exxon accountable. It’s also the point that hooked Poliner, the San Diego grandmother and teacher. “We’re talking about the future of the world, something that will destroy our planet,” Poliner said. “I can’t think of anything that’s more important.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

Fueled in part by a strong El Niño, ski resorts in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, such as Lake Tahoe, got more snow the first few weeks of December than all of last winter. In the European Alps, many major ski areas are in the same boat as the northeastern U.S., with their slopes empty of snow weeks after their typical opening days.

    "date": "2015-12-04T06:30:08-05:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil Corp. will probably miss a Dec. 4 deadline for turning over to New York state prosecutors almost four decades of documents on climate change, according to people familiar with the attorney general’s investigation of the fossil fuel giant. It may take Exxon into next year to fully comply with a subpoena issued last month by the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, according to the people, who said they couldn’t comment on the record because they aren’t authorized to discuss the investigation. The delay reflects the sheer scope of the records investigators are seeking on the company’s climate science research and communications about it, they said. “It’s a very large and complex undertaking to recreate 30 or 40 years documenting the history being sought by the attorney general,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at the Vermont Law School. “I don’t think the attorney general could have reasonably expected Exxon to meet such a deadline.” At the same time, he said, “What the deadline does do is show Exxon that the attorney general is serious.” Although there is no penalty for missing the deadline, one of the first things Exxon and the attorney general’s office will most likely agree to is a timeline for the company to turn over documents, Parenteau said. Even then, he said, it’s probable that Exxon will not be required to turn over everything at once but rather to incrementally surrender the records. The company may come under pressure to provide the same materials to other investigators. Attorneys general in California and 15 other states have also been asked by Climate Hawks Vote, an environmental activist organization, to investigate whether Exxon misrepresented the risks of climate change to investors and the public. Presidential candidates, lawmakers, climate scientists and environmentalists have also repeatedly urged the U.S. Justice Department to probe the matter under federal racketeering statutes. The calls followed an investigative series of stories published by InsideClimate News that revealed Exxon scientists were warning company executives as far back as more than three decades ago of the potentially catastrophic consequences of global warming. The Los Angeles Times later published similar findings. Exxon didn’t respond to a request for comment. New York prosecutors are seeking Exxon documents related to its climate change studies and how that research factored into the company’s business decisions, and the way in which it portrayed those internal findings to investors and the public. Schneiderman discussed the probe in an interview aired on PBS NewsHour last month. “The public record is troubling enough that we decided we had to bring this investigation,” Schneiderman said. “We…have issued a broad subpoena to Exxon because of public statements they have made, and how they’ve really shifted their point of view on this in terms of their public presentation and public reporting over the last few decades.” At one time Exxon was at the forefront of rigorous climate science and then “changed tactics for some reason,” he said in the interview. “We’re interested in what they were using internally and what they were telling the world.” If the investigation shows that Exxon made misleading statements about climate science, Schneiderman suggested it could amount to “some form of fraud.” New York investigators have been looking into Exxon’s disclosures to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission for about a year. New York authorities based their probe on the state’s powerful shareholder-protection statute, the Martin Act, as well as the state’s consumer protection and general business laws. The",

    "content": "The tenth to thirteenth centuries, when temperatures in Europe were unusually warm, was also a time of relative cold in the western North Atlantic, according to a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The findings further undermine the notion of a global Medieval Warm Period that climate change denialists often hold up to support the false idea that today’s global warming is a result of natural, non-manmade causes. It also further debunks the belief that early Norse settlements in Greenland flourished and later folded because of changes in the region’s climate. “The Medieval Warm Period was certainly not a global event and probably didn’t even span the entire North Atlantic region,” said Nicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University who was the lead author of the study. Young and colleagues measured the extent of glaciers, a proxy for temperature, over the last 1,000 years in Western Greenland and further west on Baffin Island.

In his response, the journalism school’s dean, Steven Coll, wrote that after reviewing the allegations, speaking to the authors and reading the email correspondence, he concluded that Exxon’s complaints were not about factual errors, but rather its dislike of how the company’s climate change record was interpreted. “What you dispute is the emphasis of the articles,” Coll wrote to Kenneth P. Cohen, Exxon’s vice president of public affairs and the author of the letter to Columbia. “You have dressed up this rather commonplace criticism of investigative reporting in academic clothing, alleging violations of university research standards. In any event, the record that I have reviewed does not support your characterization.” On November 20, Cohen sent a six-page letter to Columbia President Lee Bollinger accusing journalism school instructor Susanne Rust and her reporting team of graduate students of serious ethical lapses in producing two lengthy articles published in October in The Los Angeles Times.

    "title": "Companies Could Pay ‘Talent Tax’ for Ignoring Climate Change, Survey Suggests",
    "date": "2015-12-02T11:00:27-05:00",
    "content": "The threats that climate change pose to a business’s bottom line are well known—severe weather events alone can disrupt everything from production to distribution and sales—but an additional asset, future talent, could also be at risk if businesses don’t take proactive measures to address global warming, a new study suggests. Forty-four percent of business school students say they would accept a lower salary to work for a company with better climate change and other environmental practices, according to a report published Wednesday by Yale University, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Global Network for Advanced Management. One in five business school students also said they would be unwilling to work for a company with bad environmental practices, regardless of the salary offered. “You might think that business students are very mercenary, but that doesn’t seem to be the case,” said Todd Cort, who teaches sustainability at Yale’s school of management and is a lead author on the report. “They see climate change as something that needs to be addressed.” The results are based on the responses of 3,700 students from 29 leading business schools around the world; they were asked about how they would address climate change and other environmental concerns in their future careers. Cort says the findings send a clear signal to the business community that a failure to address global warming will also affect its ability to hire top talent. “There is this clear kind of tax that companies that don’t perform well and don’t address climate change and environmental sustainability are going to have to pay to recruit employees,” Cort said. Not everyone, however, was encouraged by the findings. “What kind of shocks me is that four-fifths of business students would not refuse to work for a company that they perceived to have bad environmental practices,” said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate and business law at Cornell University. By focusing their teaching on maximizing profits while not encouraging students to think about the consequences of their actions for the rest of the world and for future generations, business schools are largely to blame, Stout said. Sixty-four percent of survey respondents said they wanted more career services and counseling on sustainability-related jobs, and 61 percent added that business schools should hire more faculty and staff with expertise in sustainability. Cort disagreed with Stout’s rather pessimistic assessment of business school students and the institutions that educate them. Among the four-fifths of students who said they would work for an environmentally irresponsible company, Cort noted that 44 percent said they would require a higher salary to do so, and 84 percent said that if two companies offered equal pay, they would work for the company that they perceived as more responsible. “You are really limiting your talent pool if you are a company that is not taking these things seriously,” Cort said. Robin Roberts, an accounting professor at the University of Central Florida, noted that choosing between companies with good and bad environmental practices may be more difficult than it seems. “Since companies make mostly voluntary disclosures they tend to focus selectively on positive efforts and fail to report on the negative environmental aspects of their performance,” Roberts said in an email. Choosing a company with a “good” climate and environmental track record may actually be a process of selecting the company that is the least bad, Roberts added. “It is hard to find a business growth strategy that is a net benefit to planetary sustainability,” he said. Though largely pessimistic about the study’s findings, Stout said she does sense a growing change in priorities in today’s students, based on her own observations. “The millennial generation is much less wedded to free market ideology and much more conscious of their ethical and moral responsibilities when it comes to the matter of climate change,” Stout said. Cort said he is optimistic that the report’s findings will further encourage companies to participate in the United Nations’ ongoing climate negotiations, which have drawn 195 nations to Paris to try to hash out a new global climate regime to rein in greenhouse gas emissions over the next nine days. Any agreement will require years of follow-up, innovation and investment from public and private sectors. “To me it’s really paving the path for the corporate participation in these negotiations,” Cort said. Corporations “should be real proponents for an agreement to come out of Paris.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "Another scientific analysis has debunked the theory that global warming stalled 15 years ago. A similar finding by U.S. government scientists is at the center of a months-long probe led by Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science committee. There is no evidence of a recent pause or hiatus in global warming, according to an analysis of 40 peer-reviewed studies on the subject published Tuesday in the Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed journal of the Nature Publishing Group. Researchers found that the studies positing a hiatus didn’t examine a long enough period of time to support such a conclusion. “There has never been a pause in global warming unless you try to create one by looking at an insufficiently large number of data points,” said lead author Stephan Lewandowsky, a social scientist and professor of psychology at the University of Bristol in the U.K. The study’s co-authors are James S. Risby, a climate scientist with Australia’s national science agency, and Naomi Oreskes, a science historian at Harvard University. The most recent study is the sixth paper this year that reached similar conclusions, Lewandowsky said. Smith, a prominent climate change denialist, for months has been investigating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration focusing on a study NOAA scientists published in June debunking the hiatus theory. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the House science committee’s ranking Democrat, called the NOAA probe a “fishing expedition” and “a witch hunt designed to smear the reputations of eminent scientists for partisan gain.” The new findings cast additional doubt on studies that found a pause in climate change.

The demonstration is the latest of a dozen or so sit-ins and rallies held on college campuses across the U.S. this year. After a series of protests in the spring, from a 32-day campus sit-in at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania to a three-day protest at Tulane University in New Orleans, student action has recently picked up again across the country. In Cambridge, Mass., MIT students are approaching their fourth week of a sit-in, responding to the school’s rejection of divestment on Oct. 21. Down the street from MIT, Harvard students likewise held a rally Monday night calling on the school to divest from fossil fuels. So far, none of this year’s acts of campus civil disobedience have moved school administrators to adopt divestment. At Stanford, however, the debate is not about whether to divest, but rather how much. In May",

    "date": "2015-11-13T11:00:18-05:00",
    "content": "Portland, Oregon took a step toward combatting climate change on Thursday when its leaders unanimously supported a resolution to actively oppose the local expansion of all new fossil fuel storage and transport. Hailed as “historic” and “visionary” by climate campaigners, the resolution––passed by the mayor and four commissioners of Oregon’s largest city––is the latest in a series of major climate actions nationally. President Barack Obama recently announced the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline on climate grounds. Citing New York’s pledge to mitigate “catastrophic effects of climate change,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Thursday blocked the Port Ambrose liquefied natural gas project. Last week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and six other Democrats proposed the “Keep It In the Ground” bill to end new fossil fuel extraction on public lands. According to Portland Mayor Charlie Hales, the first-in-the-nation resolution offers a blueprint for other cities, states––even nations––to follow. Hales co-sponsored the resolution with Commissioner Amanda Fritz. “There is a fear among younger generations that their future will be compromised if our generation doesn’t act on climate change. The reality is, while climate change could be even more catastrophic, it’s not too late to do something about it. If we’re aggressive about carbon reduction, we can, city by city, make a difference,” Hales said in a statement. The resolutions is not a “ban” or “moratorium,” even though that’s how it has been referred to by some activists. Several federal preemptions would likely render a direct ban illegal, said Brett VandenHeuvel, executive director of the local grassroots group Columbia Riverkeeper. Instead, the city council’s resolution is a broad policy mandate to halt the local expansion of fossil fuels through the city’s existing laws. Over the course of several months, city staff at various departments will examine laws––including those related to public health, safety, building and fire codes––and come up with recommendations and proposed city code changes in order to enforce the policy. Their strategy must go through a public comment period before it takes effect. “I think it is a very smart approach,” said VandenHeuvel. This policy “directs city staff to take a look at their laws and enforce their laws, or change them if necessary” in order to make this policy happen. “Any city could do that.” An example of how this could work is the Pembina Pipeline Corporation’s proposal last year to build a propane storage facility. The project requires the construction of a pipeline through a swath of conservation land in Portland, where such infrastructure is prohibited. In the past, city officials might have been able to exempt the project from this law (though they have not done so). Yesterday’s resolution makes such an exemption and the project’s approval less likely. According to Bob Sallinger, conservation director of the Audubon Society of Portland, this “historic” resolution sends a firm message to the fossil fuel industry: “Portland is closed for business.” The resolution is also consistent with Portland’s",

    "date": "2015-11-15T08:00:10-05:00",
    "content": "Last fall at a journalism conference in Phoenix, Daniel Ellsberg spoke to me over dinner about the vital role that whistleblowers play in investigative journalism. He said journalists should not wait for whistleblowers to come forward—we should go looking for them. In particular, in the case of climate reporting, he suggested to me that we find people inside energy companies to expose the origins of climate denialism. “You’ll find people of conscience in every company,” he said. “I should know.” Ellsberg, now 84, is an approachable and avuncular guy, despite his uncommon brilliance. He graduated from Harvard summa cum laude, served three years in the Marine Corps, and after getting a Ph.D., also at Harvard, went to work for the RAND Corporation. He became an expert on nuclear weapons and a consultant to the Department of Defense and the White House before and during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Eventually he went to work on a top-secret history of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, which, after he made it public, came to be known as the Pentagon Papers. He was put on trial for his act of whistleblowing, and faced a possible sentence of 115 years in prison. He also became the target of governmental misconduct that figured in the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon. The next day at the conference, this time standing before a roomful of journalists, Ellsberg repeated the suggestion he had made to me. I was hoping no one else was paying attention. After InsideClimate News published Exxon: The Road Not Taken, I sent Ellsberg a note of thanks. His reply was enthusiastic. With his permission, parts of it are published below. Dear David This is the BEST, most heartwarming feedback and “thank you” I’ve ever gotten since the Pentagon Papers! (Forty years ago). I could not be more pleased, really overjoyed, at what you’re telling me! I said to Patricia [his wife], “I’ve been saying this for a year, whenever I talk about whistleblowing; I’m sure the fossil fuel companies have done internal studies of the effects of their product, just like the tobacco companies. If only someone would dig those out, or spill the beans. I knew it! And now they’ve got it!” Next I read that there was a possibility of prosecution. And now, you tell me I had a hand in this! (I’m wearing down my exclamation points). I could not be more pleased. I really think that you’ve come up with something that might make a difference. For years I’ve tried to spread the word that officials (I usually talk about government officials, only lately I’ve added corporate ones) lie all the time and keep secrets the public should know. The documents exist in safes and files (and now computers), and journalists should be actively looking for people who realize that telling certain secret truths is worth personal risk to themselves. I can only hope that I’m spreading seeds. I’ve almost never been told if one bore fruit. Now I feel like a fan who pointed to the bleachers: and it turns out I was yelling to Babe Ruth! OK, I think you get my mood. I appreciate very much that you gave me this notice. Now, I know I don’t have to tell you to Stay With It! Please thank and congratulate your team for me!

    "title": "Investors Urge Exxon to Take Moral Responsibility for Global Warming",
    "date": "2015-11-11T11:00:13-05:00",
    "content": "ExxonMobil stockholders are turning up the heat on management over the oil giant’s history of resisting action to confront climate change with a first-ever request asking the company to accept moral responsibility for global warming. The proposal by the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment calls on Exxon to take urgent climate action on moral grounds by agreeing to limit temperature rise to the globally accepted 2 degrees Celsius target. Tri-State represents nearly 40 Roman Catholic shareholder organizations with pension funds invested in the oil giant. “ExxonMobil claims that its energy production responds to a ‘moral imperative’ to meet growing energy demand and eradicate poverty, but this does not offset the necessity to mitigate climate change or the moral imperative to limit warming to 2°C,” according to the resolution. A second proposal by the Province of St. Joseph of the Capuchin Order of friars asks stockholders to vote on naming someone with climate change expertise to the board for the second year in a row. How Exxon responds to resolutions proposed for the company’s annual meeting next May could add to scrutiny of the company, as New York State prosecutors probe what Exxon knew about global warming and what it told investors and the public. Meanwhile, lawmakers, presidential candidates, climate scientists and environmentalists increasingly are calling for federal investigations of Exxon under racketeering and securities fraud statutes. “There is no doubt there is more interest in Exxon’s conduct than ever before,” said the Rev. Michael Crosby, who represents the friars and has called on the company to address climate change for more than a decade. “Exxon has dismissed calls to take responsible action on the climate for so long, and now maybe there will be a feeling that what we’ve been calling for was right all along.” The suggested resolutions, which still must be cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are part of a 25-year campaign by corporate responsibility advocates to get Exxon and other fossil fuel producers to limit emissions of harmful greenhouse gases. Exxon has rejected all the resolutions, including a widely endorsed climate policy in corporate America—to set company-wide goals to lower its emissions. The moral-responsibility proposal is “a different strategy,” said Mary Beth Gallagher, acting director of New Jersey-based Tri-State. “Our hope is that it sends a signal that a company’s shareholders care about how it generates profit, not just that it generates profits.” Exxon spokesman Scott J. Silvestri declined to address questions about the Tri-State resolution, saying the company will respond next year before the shareholder meeting. The company last week denied “allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research” after the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a subpoena for documents spanning almost four decades. The subpoena follows an InsideClimate News investigative series showing that Exxon knew decades ago of the climate effects of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Because shareholder requests at publicly traded companies are purely advisory, Exxon has no legal reason to heed shareholder demands on climate change. But there is a growing argument—most notably by Pope Francis in his encyclical on the climate and his speech to the U.S. Congress—that dealing with climate change is a moral obligation, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of Boston-based Walden Asset Management, which promotes environmental, social and corporate responsibility on behalf of investors. “From a moral point of view, they could have been part of the early warning system,” he said. “They chose another path. Now they have the opportunity to evolve and become more in line with the consensus on climate change.” But Exxon may have legal reasons not to accept the Tri-State resolution, according to Michael Gerrard, a professor of environmental law at Columbia University. “It seems the resolution asks Exxon to admit certain things that Exxon may not want to admit,” Gerrard said. “I could imagine any admission of this sort playing into some of the new theories of liability being considered.” Those include prosecuting Exxon under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, Gerrard said. The federal statute was originally enacted to fight organized crime but was successfully employed against the tobacco industry in the",

    "date": "2015-11-10T11:00:55-05:00",
    "content": "Pulling the same legal levers as those involved in its climate change investigation of ExxonMobil, the New York state attorney general’s office obtained an agreement from coal giant Peabody Energy to end misleading statements and disclose risks associated with global warming. Peabody Energy has a responsibility to be honest with investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in announcing the settlement with Peabody Monday. Other fossil fuel companies must embrace the same obligation, Schneiderman said. The agreement calls for Peabody to make more detailed disclosures to investors about the financial risks the company faces from any future changes in policies and regulations associated with climate change and other environmental issues that could reduce demand for its product and affect the company’s profitability. The company does not face any fines or other penalties. The settlement concludes a two-year investigation in which state prosecutors found that Peabody had not been upfront with investors and regulators about threats to its business from climate change issues, concerns the company considered behind closed doors, according to the 19-page settlement. “This case represents an unprecedented first step in the absolutely critical work of forcing coal and other fossil fuel companies to start being honest about the damage they are doing to our planet,” Schneiderman said in a prepared statement. “I believe that full and fair disclosures by Peabody and other fossil fuel companies will lead investors to think long and hard about the damage these companies are doing to our planet.” Last week, Schneiderman’s office demanded that Exxon turn over documents spanning four decades of research findings and communications about climate change. The office issued a subpoena ordering the oil giant to surrender materials related to its research into the causes and effects of climate change. “The Peabody case is a roadmap for the way the investigation of Exxon will proceed,” said John Marti, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota. “The central question in both cases is what were Exxon and Peabody saying publically compared to what they knew internally.” Marti is now in private practice in Minnesota. New York investigators have been looking into Exxon’s disclosures to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission for a year.

    "date": "2015-11-04T11:01:09-05:00",
    "content": "New Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s first full day in office will be greeted by hundreds of climate activists who plan to gather at his residence in Ottawa starting Thursday. The protesters will urge the new leader to take an aggressive stance on global warming—starting with halting the expansion of the Alberta tar sands. For the next four days, demonstrators plan to march a quarter-mile to 24 Sussex Drive and stage a sit in at the official residence, risking arrest for trespassing. Organizers say it will be the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of the Canadian climate action movement. “Prime Minister Trudeau has yet to define himself as one thing or another on climate change,” said Cameron Fenton, an organizer with the environmental group 350.org who is helping arrange the protests. “Meeting a 2 degree target [for global warming] means leaving 85 percent of tar sands in the ground… We need a government that is going to take bold and decisive action on climate change.” The event is being organized by 350.org, the Council of Canadians, the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition and other environmental, civil and indigenous groups. Trudeau’s Liberal Party took control of the Canadian government in late October after a stunning parliamentary election upset. Trudeau and the Liberal Party support a national carbon pricing plan and have promised to work with Canadian provincial leaders to create a climate action strategy. The new prime minister has even invited the provincial leaders to attend the December climate treaty talks with him in Paris. But environmentalists have criticized Trudeau for not providing more detail on how he plans to accomplish those goals. The new leader is also supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline project, which he has called “important energy infrastructure.” Production in the Alberta tar sands, the world’s third-largest oil reserve stretching nearly 55,000 square miles, nearly doubled during Stephen Harper’s nine-year tenure leading the Conservative government. Harper led a systematic dismantling of Canada’s climate agenda during his time in office, slashing funding for several climate research facilities, firing government scientists and muzzling others, weakening dozens of environmental regulations and undermining international climate treaty talks. Slumping global oil prices have shaken the country’s economy over the past year, and calls to expand and diversify Canada’s energy portfolio and employment base became campaign issues. Organizers of the protests say stopping the continued expansion of the oil sands is the obvious place for Trudeau to start to both boost Canada’s economy and fight climate change. “When you find yourself in a hole like this, the first rule is simple: stop digging,” the event’s website says. “This is literally what we need Prime Minister Trudeau to commit to. Freeze the expansion of the tar sands and commit to a justice-based transition to a clean energy economy. No huge new mines on top of the ones that already scar the landscape, poison the environment and violate Indigenous and treaty rights—it’s already big enough. Instead, build a just, clean energy economy that works for people and the planet.” The protests plan to present Trudeau with “gifts” every day upon their arrival to the residence, including copies of scientific reports, signatures on petitions to stop tar sands drilling from the past 10 years, and a set of solar panels, which organizers hope Trudeau will install at 24 Sussex. Trudeau announced soon after his election that he will not be moving into the official residence for a few weeks because of renovations being done to the building. Organizers decided to keep the protests there because Trudeau will still be at the building for important meetings and summits. The demonstrators are being briefed on the legal risks they will likely face by trespassing on government property. A team of lawyers will be on site, and organizers plan to launch a crowdfunding campaign to pay legal fees associated with protesters’ arrests. “We’ve rallied, we’ve marched, we’ve written op-eds, we’ve confronted politicians and still Canada has remained a pariah on the world stage when it comes to climate action,” the organizers’ wrote on their website. “We also know that we simply don’t have time to wait three, two or even one year for a new government to get its act together on climate. We are ready to step up our mobilizations to demonstrate the urgency and immediate need for action in the face of a catastrophic global crisis to Canadian politicians.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

If approved, the $190 million complex would handle up to 360,000 barrels (or 15 million gallons) of oil a day. Much of it would travel by rail through Portland and surrounding communities. “With this amount of oil comes an enormous amount of risk,” Cristina Nieves, policy advisor and executive assistant to the bill’s primary sponsor, Commissioner Amanda Fritz, said at the meeting.

    "date": "2015-11-05T18:32:53-05:00",
    "content": "New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office demanded that ExxonMobil Corporation give investigators documents spanning four decades of research findings and communications about climate change, according to a person familiar with the year-long probe. An 18-page subpoena issued to the oil giant late Wednesday seeks documents from Exxon (NYSE:XOM) related to its research into the causes and effects of climate change, to the integration of climate change findings into business decisions, to communications with the board of directors and to marketing and advertising materials on climate change, the person said. Investigators have been looking closely into the company’s disclosures to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the subpoena also sought documents related to those communications. The probe is based on New York’s powerful shareholder-protection statute, the Martin Act, as well as the state’s consumer protection and general business laws. “We have received a subpoena for production of documents relating to climate change from the attorney general of New York and are assessing our response,” Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement. “ExxonMobil has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in our 10-K, Corporate Citizenship Report and in other reports to shareholders. We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.” While investigators have been looking into what Exxon knew about climate change and what it said about it to the public and shareholders for some time, recent investigative news reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times made the issue “more ripe,” the person said. Lawmakers, presidential candidates, environmentalists and climate scientists have recently begun calling for investigations of Exxon under federal racketeering and securities laws. “Just as New York’s Teddy Roosevelt took on the Standard Oil Trust a century ago, New York’s attorney general has shown great courage in holding to account arguably the richest and most powerful company on Earth,” Bill McKibben, founder of the advocacy organization 350.org said in a statement. “We hope that other state attorney generals and the federal Department of Justice, and the Securities Exchange Commission will show similar fortitude.” New York’s Martin Act forbids “any fraud, deception, concealment, suppression, false pretense” or “any representation or statement which is false” and gives the state broad powers of discovery.

    "date": "2015-11-04T11:00:08-05:00",
    "content": "When environmental advocates started selling cheap solar power to a church in Greensboro, N.C., five months ago, they did it to test the state’s ban on non-utility providers of renewable energy. But now the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy, is fighting back. As state regulators review the controversial case, the battle lines are clearly drawn. Advocates at North Carolina Waste Awareness and Reduction Network (NC WARN) and members of Faith Community Church support policy change. Duke Energy has responded by asking regulators to impose a stiff financial penalty against NC WARN that could threaten to shut down the organization. “The stakes are high,” said Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN, a small nonprofit dedicated to tackling climate change by promoting renewable energy. Referring to Duke Energy, Warren said, “they certainly don’t want competition.” When NC WARN submitted the case for regulatory review by the North Carolina Utilities Commission back in June, it argued that it should be exempted from the third-party sales restriction because it was providing funding and a service to the church beyond selling electricity. If the commission lets the partnership stand—a decision not expected for several months—it would open the door to similar projects. And the interest is already there: dozens of churches looking to following in Faith Community Church’s footsteps have reached out to NC WARN in recent months, said Warren. North Carolina is one of four states with limitations on third-party sales. Earlier this year legislators proposed a bill allowing third-party solar providers in the state, but it failed to get out of committee. Seeing this case as an opportunity, SolarCity and other solar proponents including North Carolina Interfaith Power & Light have filed in support of NC WARN’s position. But Duke Energy argues there is no wiggle room in the existing law, a position shared by the public staff of the Utilities commission, which makes policy recommendations to the commission but is not the same as the seven commissioners who will ultimately vote on this case. “The law is clear in North Carolina,” said company spokesman Randy Wheeless. If you want to sell power in the state, that makes you a utility and subject to all the regulations that come with that role. That’s why Duke has proposed regulators impose a $1,000 fine on NC WARN for every day its solar panels are connected to the grid. That would amount to more than $120,000. Regulators have charged power providers similar daily fines for violations in the past, Wheeless explained. Sam Watson, general counsel for the Utilities Commission, told InsideClimate News that similar penalties have been imposed, but their circumstances are not similar to this case. According to NC WARN’s Warren, the group’s budget in",

Although boardwalks and businesses have reopened, and families have returned home after months, if not years, of upheaval, what hasn’t been restored is the confidence that New York could handle the next storm of Sandy’s size and destructive power. In the years following Sandy’s unprecedented destruction—43 people died in New York City and the damage was estimated at $32 billion—the city has been busy implementing a $20 billion resiliency plan to safeguard its five boroughs from future climate-related impacts. It revised building codes, replenished beaches and is in the process of designing and studying walls and wetlands to stave off sea level rise and stronger coastal storms, all expected to come with future climate change. But the question remains, is New York resilient enough? The city is better off than it was before Sandy, scientists and environmental, policy and legal experts told InsideClimate News, but there’s still much to do. “This stuff takes time, it is complicated work,” said Bill Ulfelder, New York State executive director for The Nature Conservancy. “The needle is moving in the right direction, but we need to be moving faster.

When asked after a town hall event in Berlin, N.H. whether she would call for a federal probe into Exxon, Clinton replied, “Yes, yes, they should. There’s a lot of evidence that they misled people.” The Clinton campaign did not respond to InsideClimate News’ request for further comment. Clinton joins a growing number of politicians—including both of her Democratic presidential challengers—calling for the Justice Department to investigate ExxonMobil for sowing doubt about climate change after the company’s own scientists had confirmed and accepted the role of fossil fuels in global warming. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this month asking for a task force to investigate Exxon. Governor Martin O’Malley voiced his support for an investigation on Twitter. Hours before Clinton’s statement Thursday, four U.S. Senators, led by Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, sent a letter to ExxonMobil Corp. asking whether it made donations to a financial clearinghouse that were funneled to climate denial groups after the company said it had stopped making direct contributions to them. Two California congressmen—Democratic representatives Mark DeSaulnier and Ted Lieu—also asked for a federal probe earlier this month. The calls for investigation have been prompted by ongoing reporting from InsideClimate News, and separate but related project by the Los Angeles Times.

    "content": "A Southern California school district will soon become one of the first in the nation to get most of its electricity from on-campus solar panels and giant batteries. The Temecula Valley Unified School District partnered with the San Mateo-based solar provider SolarCity to install a network of 20 solar arrays and five batteries for energy storage systems across 19 schools and one administrative building. The district’s total capacity will be 6 megawatts—that’s enough electricity to power nearly 1,000 homes—and is among the largest school solar projects in the country. This venture is rare, said Phillip Haddix, program director at The Solar Foundation, a research and education group. Last year, about 3,750 schools invested in solar, but only a handful chose the solar-plus-storage route, Haddix said. But with the cost of both solar and storage technologies declining, he told InsideClimate News that he expects there will be “a bigger uptake in adoption” in the future. Case in point: Temecula Valley. Temecula opted for this trendsetting project to cut costs in the face of rising electricity prices. Located in Riverside County, the district of 32 schools and approximately 27,700 students currently spends about $3 million a year on utilities. Before entertaining the idea of solar, Temecula district spent four years cutting its electrical usage about 20 percent by being more efficient, such as cutting the use of air conditioning. “We had gotten to the point where we felt that we cut about as much as we could readily,” said Janet Dixon, the district’s director of facilities development. “It was time to look at solar.” When Temecula Valley was considering the idea, there was already a lot of solar in the area, explained Dixon.

    "date": "2015-09-28T19:19:33-04:00",
    "content": "Royal Dutch Shell announced Monday it is abandoning a multibillion-dollar effort to drill for oil and gas in the Arctic, bowing not to the vocal protests or calls to save the climate, but to cold hard reality. The company’s exploratory well, it turned out, was not finding enough oil or gas. Shell said that its exploratory drilling at the Burger J well in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea tapped some reserves, but Shell determined they were “not sufficient to warrant further exploration,” according to a company statement. The project’s results are “a clearly disappointing exploration outcome,” said Marvin Odum, the director of Shell Upstream Americas. Environmentalists feel otherwise, hailing the company’s decision as a major win for the climate. “Shell’s abandonment of drilling and cancellation of all exploratory activity in the Arctic is joyous news for our climate, communities along the Arctic Ocean, and the hundreds of thousands of people who have joined in public protests saying ‘Shell No’ to Arctic drilling,” Michael Brune, Sierra Club’s executive director, said in a statement. Earlier this year, Shell faced a flotilla of “kayaktivists” in Seattle during the departure of its Arctic drilling fleet. While en route to Alaska, the company discovered a gash in one of its Arctic-bound icebreakers, the Fennica. The damaged vessel was sent for repairs to Portland, where the company faced a new wave of protests. Shell’s Arctic efforts later got it kicked out of the Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, a group Shell helped establish. Despite the opposition to the project, environmental advocates were caught off guard by Monday’s announcement. “It’s safe to say we were pretty surprised,” said Tim Donaghy, a senior research specialist at Greenpeace. Shell cited the project’s high costs—the company said it would lose spent $4.1 billion on the failed project—and an unpredictable regulatory environment as the driving factors behind the decision to halt drilling offshore of Alaska “for the foreseeable future.” Shell has sunk more than $7 billion into its Arctic drilling efforts. The Arctic has remained tantalizing to oil companies because it is estimated to contain 22 percent of the world’s untapped oil and gas reserves. But tapping that comes with major logistical problems, largely because of sea ice and unpredictable weather. Russian companies have watched their efforts to drill offshore languish as well and plunging oil prices have made the endeavor even less rewarding. “This amount of wasted capital is something that Ceres and its investors have been warning Shell about for years now,” Shanna Cleveland, senior manager of the carbon assets risk initiative at the Boston-based sustainability group Ceres. “It really shows that going after these types of high-risk projects, where you essentially need to hit a gusher to break even is a not a good strategy for companies,” she said. Ann Pickard, a Shell executive vice president, warned that the Arctic program hinged on the success of the Burger J well back in May. According to FuelFix, Pickard said, “If we get a dry hole in J, we’re done.” This is not the first time Shell’s northern drilling efforts have been stymied. In",

What a … day this is.” Green groups have struggled for decades to enlist young people to not just care about environmental issues, but also to actively participate in the movement for change, by attending rallies and engaging their political leaders. Turns out, Beyoncé and the other headlining bands were a pretty good bribe. The Global Citizen Festival is now in its fourth year and boasted a star-studded cast. New Yorker Marie Ternes, 26, said she wasn’t much of an activist before now and that “the music was the bait.” Sarah Ranaldson and Matt Ascani, both 20 and students from the University of New Hampshire, hadn’t done much either. “I saw that Coldplay was playing and that piqued my interest,” Ranaldson said. “The messages about gender inequality have really resonated with me. I’ll definitely consider doing more activism from here on out.” Emily Kelvas, 23, and Francesca Sills, 24, traveled from the Hudson Valley region of New York for the festival. Both have attended before, but said the activism required to get tickets this year was more intense than in previous years. Younger generations have gotten involved in a few aspects of the modern climate movement. The divestment movement, calling for endowments and pension funds to pull their money from fossil fuel company stocks, got its start at colleges across the country, for example. The People’s Climate March in New York City last September included tens of thousands of students and young adults marching for climate action. But most climate action events, especially smaller, community ones, are populated by Baby Boomers—not their kids. Jenny Marienau, manager of 350.org’s U.S. divestment campaign, said she has heard a lot of frustration from grassroots groups about why more young people aren’t coming to meetings and events. “Young people, above all else, want to understand how the actions they take now lead to the change they want to see,” Marienau said. “Youth aren’t just out there to feel good about themselves or for fun. They’re hungry for change, and they need to be treated less as warm bodies and more as co-conspirators.” Bob Wilson, a historian at Syracuse University who studies the modern environmental movement, said activism has been consumer-based for decades. If you are concerned about climate change, you buy a different car or you recycle, he said. The Global Citizen Festival is a similar model, but “it is good that it requires people to express some deeper sort of commitment beyond just buying a ticket.” Wilson noted the success of the divestment movement and the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline in getting youth involved in activism. “But in terms of how to get students to push for political change, to sway Congress, I don’t think anyone has cracked that yet,” he said. The Global Citizen Festival this year focused largely on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals adopted Friday, which will address poverty, hunger, inequality and climate change. The goals’ logo stayed on the main screen for most of the concert. Celebrities and political leaders focused their messages on the UN’s new agenda. Michelle Obama announced a White House-led effort to get the world’s 62 million uneducated girls into school, called the #62milliongirls campaign. World Bank group president Dr Jim Yong Kim and Big Bird talked about the public health benefits of portable toilets. A number of leaders spoke about the Syrian refugee crisis. DiCaprio said the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals are critical to ensure that shelter, food, education and medical care “are seen no longer as privileges, but as inalienable rights. But all this work would be in vain if we don’t address climate change.” “Powerful fossil fuel interests are fighting to monetize what is still underground,” he told the crowd. “Please get involved. The fight for the planet and against poverty are inherently linked.” Coldplay played their set to images of the planet scrolling in the background. Ed Sheeran took the stage solo, his voice cutting clear across Central Park’s packed Great Lawn. Beyoncé focused on female empowerment, performing Run the World, Diva and Survivor interspersed with quotes from Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and poet Maya Angelou. Pearl Jam closed the show with a 50-minute set that included Mind Your Manners, Do the Evolution, Better Man, a cover of Bob Marley’s Redemption Song with Beyoncé and Rockin’ in the Free World. After six hours of standing, not to mention countless hours waiting to get in and go through security to enter the festival, the crowd looked exhausted by the time Pearl Jam played its last song just after 10 p.m. But most stuck it out until the very end, listening patiently to calls for action to hear their favorite musicians. How many of the attendees will continue their streak of activism, however, remains to be seen. “We need young people to win on climate, and in some ways it’s their fight more than anyone’s,” Marienau of 350.org said. “It sounds trite, but the concentrated voice of young activists has real power, because they are the voice of the future. Students and youth have led social movements throughout history, and this generation of youth is growing in political power.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Pope Francis to Congress: Act on Issues of Life and Death, Including Climate",
    "date": "2015-09-24T16:34:19-04:00",
    "content": "In a landmark speech to a Joint Session of Congress Thursday morning, Pope Francis urged U.S. lawmakers to take “courageous actions and strategies” to fight climate change. “We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all,” the Pope said. “I am convinced that we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States—and this Congress—have an important role to play.” But in his nearly hour-long speech, Pope Francis spent just a few minutes addressing the environment and climate change. Instead, he made a broader appeal to Americans to work together on many thorny problems, including gun violence, the death penalty and immigration. He was clearly appealing to a deeply divided Congress—and country—to look beyond those divisions and recognize the common good. “Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies, aimed at implementing a culture of care and an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature,” the Pope said. Despite the brief mention of climate change—only 225 words of his 3,396-word speech were directly in reference—environmental groups said they were happy with the Pope’s address. “Pope Francis made it clear both to Congress, and yesterday at the White House, that fighting climate change is a moral obligation and must be a priority,” said David Willett, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters. “We couldn’t be more thrilled with his attention to this important issue.” In his first visit to the U.S. as Pope, the content of Francis’s speech to Congress was a matter of intense speculation, especially after he released his encyclical “Laudato Si,” or “Be Praised,” in June that called on nations to quickly and aggressively act on climate change. “His call to action on climate change has been crystal clear from the beginning, including a 184-page encyclical and yesterday, when he quoted MLK to say we’re defaulting on a promissory note,” said Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for the environmental group 350.org “I’m not super worried that he didn’t bash climate deniers today; he was speaking to a big audience, and a call for unity and moral purpose makes more sense for that.” Since the encyclical’s release, the religious leader has been making climate change a centerpiece of his appearances—including within hours of setting foot on U.S. soil. In a speech at the White House on Wednesday, the Pope commended U.S. efforts to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, finalized in August. “It seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation,” the Pope told the crowd gathered on the White House lawn. The big question remains, however, what sort of impact Pope Francis’ climate campaign will have on U.S. politicians. Republicans have been in a particularly tricky position because his climate activism runs counter to their stance on the issue. House Speaker John Boehner, a Catholic, invited Pope Francis to the U.S., and sat behind him during his speech to Congress, at times visibly uncomfortable with some of the Pope’s words. The Pope also challenged Republican policy with his call to abolish the death penalty and to deal with the proliferation of guns and gun violence. His climate agenda, though, remains the biggest hurdle for Catholic Republicans. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona announced last week that he planned to boycott the pope’s speech, pointing specifically to the religious leader’s climate campaign. “If the Pope plans to spend the majority of his time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend,” Gosar wrote on the conservative website Town Hall. “When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.” Religious and political experts predict party doctrine will likely trump church doctrine on the issue of climate. But there have been glimmers of change already. Rep. Chris Gibson, a Catholic Republican from New York recently crafted a resolution agreeing that human activity is driving climate change and urging Congress to take action. Gibson has recruited nine of his Republican colleagues to sign the resolution, including Catholic Representatives Carlos Cur­belo of Flor­ida, Pat Mee­han and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Richard Hanna and Elise Stefanik of New York. Catholics make up nearly 32 percent of the House of Representatives and 26 percent of the Senate, compared with 22 percent of the U.S. population. Environmentalists are hopeful the pope’s visit could sway these politicians on the issue, most of whom either deny that climate change is happening or argue that taking action could disrupt the economy. Several of the GOP’s most prominent climate denialists are Catholics, such as Boehner, presidential contender Marco Rubio, a Florida senator, and former vice presidential candidate and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Likely presidential contenders Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana are also Catholic. They question the science of human-caused global warming and oppose climate policy. Following his speech to Congress, Pope Francis made a public appearance in front of the Capitol Building before heading to lunch with people who are homeless or living in shelters. On Friday morning, the Pope will address the United Nations General Assembly ahead of the adoption of new sustainable development goals.

This year’s Climate Week—the seventh—kicked off over the weekend. More than 100 events fill the official calendar, which coincides with the 70th General Assembly of the United Nations, where world leaders will adopt a new set of development goals. Pope Francis’ speeches to both Congress and the UN, a climate rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. on Thursday to coincide with the Pope’s tour, and the state visit of China’s President Xi Jinping are not officially part of Climate Week, but are timed just about perfectly to round out the excitement. Here is InsideClimate News’ handy guide to the events that will make news during Climate Week: Note: All times Eastern. Some events will be live-streamed. Click on links for more information. Pope Francis’ first visit to the U.S. will include his speeches to Congress and the UN, a meeting with homeless people, a visit to a prison and presiding over Catholic masses in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York. Pope Francis to Address Congress At the invitation of Republican House Speaker John Boehner, the Pope will address both House and Senate members, and then make a public appearance outside the Capitol Building.

    "content": "The fossil fuel divestment movement skyrocketed in the past year as hundreds of institutions and thousands of individuals committed to selling their oil, natural gas and coal holdings, according to a new report. So far, 436 institutions and 2,040 individuals representing $2.6 trillion in assets have agreed to sell their fossil fuel investments, according to a review by Arabella Advisors, a Washington, D.C.-based consultant that works with philanthropies. It represents a 50-fold increase from a year ago, when the divestment totals were 181 institutions and 656 individuals representing more than $50 billion in assets. “This is just stunning and shows the real strength for this momentum for change,” Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in a recorded video shown at a press conference Tuesday. Figueres said divestment is critical to keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, forestalling the most catastrophic effects of climate change, while making the transition to clean energy sources. The divestment event was part of Climate Week, a series of climate-related events and announcements in New York. Now in its seventh year, this Climate Week will include meetings on climate resiliency, clean energy and the Paris climate treaty negotiations.

    "date": "2015-09-21T09:00:30-04:00",
    "content": "The source of water used for drilling in the Alberta tar sands could dry up in the coming decades, according to new research released Monday. The questionable future of the Athabasca River threatens the longevity of fossil fuel extraction in the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve. Scientists at the University of Regina and University of Western Ontario in Canada looked at 900 years of tree ring data and found water levels have dwindled along the 765-mile river at various points throughout its history. The analysis, published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows the waterway has shrunk over the past 50 years as global warming has melted the glaciers that feed it. It also found the region has experienced several droughts that have lasted more than a decade in the last few centuries. Such a drought could likely happen in the near future, the scientists said. “Conventional water management assumes that what you had for river flow the last 50 years is what you will have for the next 50,” said Dave Sauchyn, a climate scientist at the University of Regina in Canada and lead author of the study. This short-term data is what officials use to determine how much water tar sands operators can take from the Athabasca, he said. “No one can predict the future, but if the region’s past 900 years is any indication, and you factor in climate change, you’re going to have a warmer situation that could mean the river will no longer be a sustainable water source for the tar sands,” he said. The Alberta tar sands, which cover 55,000 square miles in western Canada, are estimated to contain approximately 1.7 trillion barrels of bitumen, a sticky, thick form of petroleum that can be extracted through both surface mining and drilling. Water is used to separate the bitumen from surrounding sediment, as well as to create steam that heats the oil so it flows into production wells. It currently takes as many as 3.1 barrels of water to produce one barrel of crude oil from the Alberta tar sands, according to the paper. In",

    "date": "2015-09-15T11:58:53-04:00",
    "content": "If you ever wondered how much of your future fortune––your retirement fund––is tied to the fortunes of fossil fuels, now there’s an app for that too. Andrew Behar, who runs a foundation that promotes socially responsible investing, shared your curiosity. So he sat down at his computer to figure out how much of his retirement fund depended on the growth and success of fossil fuel companies. What he discovered was disturbing. And what he came up with is FossilFreeFunds.org. It’s a web platform that makes it easier for investors to assess the holdings in their portfolios. It was a natural project for Behar, who is chief executive of As You Sow, a 23-year-old nonprofit in Oakland, Calif., which promotes shareholder activism and dialogue with corporations. Behar spent days sifting through federal securities databases and creating spreadsheets in an effort to track down every last fossil fuel company in his 401k plan. Ultimately, after a bit of coding help from a coworker, he came to a startling realization, he says: “We were up to our necks in fossil fuels and we didn’t know it.” The website, which launches Tuesday, is free and designed to be simple to use. Enter the name or the ticker code––a five-letter shorthand––of the mutual fund in your 401k or other plan into a search box, and the tool will pull up a list of the fossil fuel stocks in the fund. The tool allows users to filter fossil fuel companies in different ways. Investors can search for companies on the Carbon Underground 200, a list of the top 100 coal companies and top 100 oil and gas companies. Or users can search for the so-called Filthy 15, the largest and dirtiest coal companies in the U.S. They can also choose to include peripheral service companies such as pipeline constructors. The tool also has an option to filter for fossil fuel-fired utilities. The range of options allows users to decide how they want to define fossil fuel stocks. “We’re not making value judgments,” said Behar. “This is a transparency tool to let people know what they own, so they can own what they own.” The website pulls data from Morningstar, an investment research firm based in Chicago. When Morningstar updates its holding data once a month, FossilFreeFunds.org automatically updates its data. “More information gives investors better tools for making informed decisions, whether for retirement accounts or any other part of their portfolio,” Lisa Woll, head of the national association The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, told InsideClimate News in an email. “We welcome new initiatives like this one that provide easily accessible information on a broad range of investors on critical environmental, social and governance issues.” Scientists have warned that failing to keep the planet’s warming to within 2 degrees Celsius could be catastrophic. Burning all of the world’s fossil fuels would melt almost the entire Antarctic ice sheet, leading to sea level rise of 200 feet, according to a recent study.

    "date": "2015-09-09T11:37:44-04:00",
    "content": "It was a late afternoon in July when James Spriggs, a West Texas rancher, was driving home and got a call from a representative of Energy Transfer Partners, a pipeline company based in Dallas. The man on the line issued him an ultimatum, Spriggs said: sign an agreement giving the company access to build a pipeline through his ranch in Marfa or face a court order in 48 hours. “I said, ‘Then send the court order and the sheriff,'” Spriggs recalled. “My last nerve had come to an end.” Spriggs, 70, bought his cattle ranch 23 years ago with his now deceased wife, Glenda, who loved animals. He worked for the state highway department before deciding to raise cattle full time. He is now part of an unlikely coalition of environmentalists and ranchers at the forefront of a fight to stop the construction of a pipeline running through one of Texas’ last remaining pristine natural landscapes. The Trans-Pecos pipeline will originate at the Waha hub near Fort Stockton, then traverse the northern edge of the Chihuahuan desert before dipping under the Rio Grande and into Mexico, where it will connect to another pipeline, in the border town of Ojinaga. Residents are angry not only because the pipeline will run near ecologically sensitive areas, but also because its construction will rattle their quiet communities and when it is operational, they will live with the prospect of an explosion threatening their safety. Vicki Granado, a spokesperson for ETP, said the company’s first priority was to obtain voluntary agreements to use residents’ land. Without that, the company has other legal options, but those “are undertaken only in situations where we cannot come to a mutual agreement with the landowner,” she said. Their properties fell into ETP’s sights because of the mushrooming demand for power in Mexico’s growing cities. The country’s pipelines haven’t been able to handle the increased load, leading to a natural gas crisis. In",

    "date": "2015-09-10T19:16:29-04:00",
    "content": "The growing fossil fuel divestment movement snagged what its proponents consider a significant victory as the University of California announced Wednesday that it had successfully purged its $200 million in coal and oil sands holdings. “This is a huge, huge, huge win,” said Karthik Ganapathy from 350.org, an environmental group that has supported divestment efforts nationwide. This “adds a lot of momentum to the divestment campaign and right when we need it.” This news came a week after the California legislature passed a bill mandating that the state’s two major public pension funds, worth a combined nearly $500 billion, divest their less than one percent holdings in coal. The University of California—one of the largest university systems in the world—is made up of 10 campuses and 238,000 students. The school’s investment portfolio is made up of five funds totaling about $98 billion. School officials say all direct holdings in coal and oil sands have been sold from these funds, but the school’s indirect holdings may still be tied up in such companies. The school system’s decision to divest was shared at a recent Board of Regents meeting by chief investment officer Jagdeep Bachher. “Slowing global demand, an increasingly unfavorable regulatory environment, and high threat of substitution pose insurmountable challenges to coal mining companies. We believe coal mining stocks will not see a sufficient recovery warranting investment for the foreseeable future,” Bachher said, according to a transcript provided by the University of California’s Office of the President. Bachher added that oil sands were similarly “an increasingly risky investment.” Divestment activists said they were not aware the university system had been quietly divesting its holding in recent months, said Silver Hannon, a fossil free campaign director with the California Student Sustainability Coalition. “However, it’s not surprising news given the vast university-wide support for divestment from these companies and the continued pressure we’ve placed on the [University of California] over the last year,” said Hannon. Activists have been urging the University of California to divest for three years. Although happy with the recent news, they remain committed to pressuring the university system to also rid its portfolio of oil and natural gas assets. The University of California schools join nine other colleges and universities in the state that have already divested or committed to doing so. The primary argument for divestment is laid out on the 350.org website: “If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from the wreckage.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2015-09-11T10:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Methane is spewing from more than 1,000 natural gas leaks under Manhattan, giving it 10 times the number of leaks per mile in its aging natural gas pipelines as cities with more up-to-date infrastructure, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. Methane is the second-largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide, making the reduction of methane emissions a high priority in fighting climate change. While methane emissions are significantly smaller than those of CO2, methane is much more potent as a greenhouse gas, trapping 86 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and 34 times more over 100 years. In the study, researchers measured concentrations of methane on the streets of New York, which has a high concentration of decades-old cast iron and steel pipes beneath its streets. They compared the findings with measurements in Durham, N.C., and Cincinnati, which recently replaced their aging pipelines. “What was surprising was how well [pipeline replacement] programs worked,” said lead author Robert Jackson of Stanford University. “They reduced leaks to very low densities.” Methane leaks are the subject of an $18 million project led by the Environmental Defense Fund that includes work by more than 100 researchers. That project, which is not affiliated with the current study, is being done in collaboration with the natural gas industry and utilities. The researchers in the Manhattan study concluded that pipes under Manhattan averaged 4.3 leaks for each mile of pipe. Durham had 0.2 leaks per mile and Cincinnati had 0.5. Replacing the pipes, some of which have been in use for more than 100 years, also improves air quality and reduces the risk of explosion. One such explosion killed eight people and destroyed an apartment building in East Harlem in",

That’s what’s in store if all available fossil fuel reserves are burned, releasing about 10,000 gigatons of carbon and almost completely melting the Antarctic ice sheet, according to the research published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances. “Global sea level rise of that magnitude is unprecedented in human civilization,” said Ricarda Winkelmann, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and the lead author of the study. “Dozens of major coastal cities would be threatened, including New York, Tokyo, and Shanghai.” Winkelmann and colleagues found that seas could rise nearly 10 feet each century in the first 1,000 years under this scenario, and would continue to rise for thousands of years after that. Some scientists reviewing the study, though, said researchers may have even underestimated the speed of ice melt and sea level rise. “We usually think about our generation, maybe the next generation,” Winkelmann said. “It is hard for people to think of Earth a thousand years in the future. But what we are doing right now, the CO2 we are emitting into the atmosphere, could change the face of our planet a thousand years from now.” Antarctica has not been ice-free since approximately 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, Winkelmann said. Until recently, scientists have focused mostly on how the Greenland ice sheet, which is one-eighth the size of its southern neighbor and therefore more susceptible to rapid thawing, will respond to global warming. But large sections of Antarctica once considered stable have begun melting at an alarming rate in the past few years. Scientists estimate that the world has already emitted two-thirds of the greenhouse gases that can be released before global warming exceeds 2 degrees Celsius since the beginning of the Industrial Age. That’s the threshold after which climate impacts are expected to be catastrophic, and is the target for international climate treaty negotiations in Paris this December. But with much of the world declining to cut emissions as much or as quickly as scientists say is needed, Winkelmann and colleagues at the Carnegie Institution for Science and the University of California modeled what would happen to the Antarctic ice sheet if nations were to use up all the oil and gas available before completing a transition to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. They found that if the world succeeds in limiting emissions to an additional 600 gigatons of carbon, most likely holding warming to 2 degrees, much of Antarctica would remain intact and its contribution to global sea level rise would be just 6 and a half feet. Burn all 10,000 gigatons of remaining carbon and the outcome is “terribly scary,” said Hal Wanless, a climate scientist at the University of Miami. “The results of this study are sobering.” But Wanless said the model Winkelmann and her colleagues used probably underestimated how quickly Antarctica’s ice will melt and seas will rise. “Ice feels change early and it feels it quickly,” Wanless said. “When we went from the last ice age to today, there were serious rapid pulses of rise. That’s what we should expect now, several feet in a short period of time. Not the millennial time scale shown in the study. There is no way we aren’t going to have a major rise this century.” Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State, also said the modeling results seemed too conservative, particularly in the immediate decades and centuries to come. “The authors show a maximum sea level rise from Antarctic melt of only a small fraction of a meter per century for a 2C warming target,” Mann said. “But there is considerable empirical evidence that we are likely already now committed to at least three to four meters of sea level rise from West Antarctic ice loss, due to warming already in the pipeline and the destabilization of the ice shelves.” In other words, there might a worse worst-case scenario than even this study predicted.

    "content": "A report released Wednesday examining the pay practices of the 30 largest publicly held U.S. oil, gas, and coal companies concluded that pay incentives for the companies’ chief executives encourages reckless behavior and is hastening a climate crisis. In the analysis, all 13 oil exploration and production companies examined by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) tied executive bonuses to increasing the amount of proven carbon reserves each year. “What we are essentially doing here is paying people massive amounts of money to continue to drill and burn and do things that are going to harm the planet and put a lot of costs on the rest of us,” said lead author Sarah Anderson of IPS, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. Fossil fuel companies current hold vast reserves of oil, gas, and coal which, if burned in their entirety would emit five times the amount of carbon than can be emitted to keep the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. The same companies also spend $600 billion a year to locate additional carbon reserves. “These companies are already sitting on reserves that if fully burned would cause catastrophic effects, so why are we tying executive bonuses to expanding those reserves?” Anderson said. Compensation packages for corporate executives are increasingly tied to short-term profit gains, a practice financial watchdogs criticize. For the oil and gas sector, however, the concern is amplified by the carbon dioxide emissions created from burning fossil fuels. “When you’re talking about companies with this great of an impact on our long-term health, we think it is even more necessary to take a long hard look at this and change the incentives,” Anderson said.

    "title": "Obama Walks a Fine Line on Climate in Alaska, and So Do Alaskans",
    "date": "2015-09-01T09:00:26-04:00",
    "content": "President Obama hopes his three-day tour of Alaska this week highlights the devastating impacts of climate change in the Arctic, even though it comes just two weeks after he approved a permit for Shell to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea. That move has generated ire from many environmentalists who see this trip as hypocritical. But the conflicting actions demonstrate the grey area Obama is attempting to navigate around climate change: He is fighting for global warming action, particularly in the months before international climate treaty talks in Paris begin in December, while at the same time supporting one of the nation’s most profitable industries and the foundation of its energy system. And it is a struggle that the people of Alaska are all too familiar with, perhaps more so than in any other state. Alaska has warmed 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit in the last half-century—twice the national average. Entire coastal towns have been relocated due to rising sea levels. As the state’s permafrost melts, hundreds of miles of roads, airstrips and other transportation infrastructure have collapsed under the sinking soil. But Alaska is also highly dependent on fossil fuels. With no income or sales tax, nearly 90 percent of the state’s operating budget comes from the oil and gas industry and one-third of its jobs are tied to fossil fuel extraction. “Alaskans are already living with [climate change’s] effects,” Obama said in his weekly address on Saturday. “More frequent and extensive wildfires. Bigger storm surges as sea ice melts faster. Some of the swiftest shoreline erosion in the world—in some places, more than three feet a year… Even as we accelerate this transition [to renewable energy], our economy still has to rely on oil and gas.” These conflicting, complex factors have left communities in the northernmost state of the union divided over the issue of climate change. Sixty-two percent of Alaskans acknowledge global warming is happening, but only 45 percent attribute it to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels, according to estimates and polling data analysis by Yale University. “People are struggling to reconcile the impacts of climate change they see every day with the very real human intuition to stick with the status quo, in this case with the industry that has supported our state financially for decades,” said Jim Adams, policy director for the conservation organization Audubon Alaska. Groups on both sides of the issue are taking Obama’s visit as an opportunity to make their point. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which represents approximately 12,000 Inupiat Eskimo shareholders, asked Obama in television ad last week to “stand with Alaskans and continue to support Arctic energy development.” The group reiterated the point in a letter sent to the President on Friday. “History has shown us that the responsible energy development which is the lifeblood of our economy can exist in tandem with, and significant enhance, our traditional way of life,” leaders of the group wrote. But in an op-ed in The Guardian on Monday, Inupiaq Eskimo artist Othniel Art Oomittuk Jr. wrote, “Using the oil locked in the Arctic Ocean will accelerate climate change. Climate change is already here for us. The ice has changed. It comes late, it leaves early.” Dozens of other environmental groups in the region have come out against Obama’s approval of Arctic offshore drilling. A rally held in Anchorage on Monday to “confront President Obama’s climate hypocrisy” attracted several hundred protesters. The event was organized bylocal green groups, including Alaska Rising Tide, RedOil, Alaska Climate Action Network, Chukchi Sea Watch and ShellNo Alaska, as well as national organizations like Greenpeace and the Center for Biological Diversity. Obama began his trip Monday by speaking at the Conference on Global Leadership in the Arctic: Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement and Resilience (GLACIER). The gathering of 21 international leaders was organized by Secretary of State John Kerry to discuss the Arctic’s climate challenges. “The United States recognizes our role in creating this problem, and we embrace our responsibility to help solve it,” Obama told the foreign ministers and delegates gathered in Anchorage. “And I believe we can solve it. That’s the good news. Even if we cannot reverse the damage that we’ve already caused, we have the means—the scientific imagination and technological innovation—to avoid irreparable harm.” Obama will skip across the state through Wednesday, hiking in Kenai Fjords National Park in Seward, meeting with salmon fishermen in Dillingham, examining rapid coastal erosion in Kotzebue, and talking with indigenous leaders at various stops along the way. At some point, he will also film a segment for the NBC reality show “Running Wild With Bear Grylls” observing the impacts of climate change. Obama is the first sitting president to visit Alaska.

    "date": "2015-09-03T10:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "More than half of North America’s birds may lose most of their current home range by the end of the century due to climate change, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE. The study models a range of scenarios with a range of greenhouse gas emissions and predicts how the distribution of nearly 600 North American bird species will change because of rising temperatures. Even under the most hopeful scenario, the study found that 126 species will lose more than 50 percent of their current range––with no opportunity to expand to more hospitable locations. In some cases, species will lose almost 100 percent of the area suitable for their survival. The results were sobering and more dire than expected, said lead author Gary Langham, chief scientist of the National Audubon Society. “It wasn’t as if the ranges were just shifting but rather they were just disappearing, almost the way you think about species on a mountaintop being pushed further and further up the top of a mountain,” Langham said. The study found 188 species that will lose more than half of their range, but could potentially inhabit new areas. “The Baltimore Oriole, state bird of Maryland and mascot for Baltimore’s baseball team, may no longer nest in the Mid-Atlantic, shifting north instead to follow the climatic conditions it requires,” Langham said in an email. The ability of some birds to colonize new areas is encouraging but other factors may make relocation difficult. “Just because climatic space moves doesn’t mean that all the things they need on the ground like habitat and food and all the predator interactions won’t necessarily line up in a favorable way for them in the future,” Langham said. The study relied on data from Audubon’s annual Christmas Bird Count and the U.S. Geological Survey’s Breeding Bird Survey. Combined, those findings provide snapshots of places where hundreds of bird species are found in winter and early summer. Langham and colleagues then combined this information with a number of climate variables, including temperature and precipitation, to build a profile of the range of climatic conditions in which individual species live. “You can then project the possible shift [in geographic range] onto any future climate that you have,” Langham said. Models based on climate are a start, but the true picture can be much more complicated, said Amanda Rodewald, director of conservation science at Cornell University’s Lab of Ornithology. “We know species are part of a community and they are influenced by other species [like] certain plants that they depend upon,” Rodewald said. Allen Hurlbert, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, agreed, citing birds living in the boreal forests that extend across south and central Canada as an example. If the temperatures rise, the birds might move farther north for a cooler climate––but doing so would push them into a completely different, tundra habitat. “Are they going to do less well where the climate is right but there are no food resources and no habitat or are they going to do less well where the climate is slightly uncomfortable but there is all the habitat and food they are accustomed to?” Hurlbert asked. Rodewald added that focusing too much on climate change could come at a cost. “We don’t want to lose sight of the fact that right now today we are still living in a world where habitat loss and degradation are the most serious threats imperiling species around the globe,” she said. Rodney Siegel, executive director of the Institute for Bird Populations in California, praised the work as an important first-of-its-kind study. “This is a starting point,” Siegel said. “What you see here is raw material for many, many specific hypothesis about how individual birds in particular places are going to move around on the landscape. What I would like to see happen is a flourishing of follow-up studies.” At the same time, Siegel says, it’s time to start acting on what we already know about the effects of a warming planet. “It’s kind of a wake-up call that many of our more common species even could be in jeopardy in the coming decades,” Siegel said. “We need to get land management right to do the best conservation that we can in the face of climate change that is largely inevitable.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "California is one governor’s signature away from becoming the first state to mandate its major public pension funds to at least partially divest from fossil fuel holdings, which could have ripple effects across the nation. The California Assembly voted 47 to 30 on Wednesday to mandate the state’s two largest pension funds divest from coal assets. It now heads to Gov. Jerry Brown’s office for approval. The Senate voted in favor of the measure in June. Even though the legislation—Senate Bill 185—awaits the governor’s signature, Brown has been a strong advocate of climate action and has helped steer the state toward being a leader in renewable energy, so divestment proponents are already celebrating. RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, was “very happy” and “giddy” after the vote. “This is the beginning of an avalanche,” said Miller, who has helped build support for fossil fuel divestment within the California Democratic Party for several years. The website 350.org, a green group that has supported divestment efforts across the country, lays out the primary argument for divestment as: “If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage.” Fully divesting involves selling off stocks and bonds tied to oil, natural gas and coal companies, and the process can take months to years. Targeted in this bill is the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), which combined represent more than 2.4 million retirees. They are the country’s two largest pension funds, worth nearly $500 billion. Less than one percent of those funds are invested in coal assets. The legislation forbids them to make new investments or renew existing investments in coal companies, and mandates they sell their holdings in these companies by July",

    "date": "2015-08-31T15:00:07-04:00",
    "content": "The odds of extreme tropical storms or hurricanes will go up significantly as the planet warms, according a study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, and they are more likely to hit areas that don’t yet consider themselves high-risk. The study looked at potential storm surge for tropical systems hitting Tampa, Fla., Cairns, Australia and the Persian Gulf. It gave these storms a new name: “grey swans.” Infrequent, high-impact, and seemingly unpredictable storms have previously been described as “black swans.” The new “grey swans” are extreme storms that seem improbable based on historical records alone, but could occur based on current understanding of oceanic and atmospheric conditions. In the Persian Gulf, tropical storms including low-intensity depressions, storms with sustained wind speeds of 39 miles per hour or less, haven’t been recorded. Computer models, however, suggest storms with wind speeds up to 257 mph, greater than the highest wind speeds that have been observed from tropical storms anywhere, could occur today. The authors note that future warming of the oceans will likely increase the chance of such an extreme storm hitting the region. “They are looking into potential systems that may happen in future climate [conditions] and have shown a range of values that exceed anything that has been observed in those regions,” said Greg Holland, a climate and hurricane researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the current study. The study shows that storm surges from extreme tropical storms could reach as high as 20 feet in Tampa, 19 feet in Cairns and 13 feet in Dubai. By the end of the century, computer models show the possibility of storm surges up to 23 and 36 feet for Dubai and Tampa. Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans 10 years ago and was the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, generated a 33-foot storm surge, the highest ever recorded in the country. The damage caused in New Orleans occurred in spite of levees built to protect the city from a storm, but which failed. The locations in this study were selected because they are not associated with or prepared for such intense storms. “The common feature of these locations is they are vulnerable but we have not recognized the vulnerability of these places before,” said lead author Ning Lin, a civil and environmental engineer at Princeton University. “For example, Tampa had extremes before but it hasn’t had extremes for the past 95 years and during that time it has greatly developed. We wanted to assess the risk even though the extremes haven’t happened for a while.” The findings are somewhat controversial as they are significantly higher than prior predictions. “Nearly all of the projections for intensity change published previously are for only 0-5 percent stronger,” said Christopher Landsea of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. “Their conclusions of hurricane intensity climate change are thus about 20 times larger than the consensus.” Holland said some of the figures, in particular the incredibly high wind speeds that could occur in the Persian Gulf, will need additional verification in future studies. On the whole, however, he said it’s a “terrific” and important study. “They are saying ‘hey, here is something that you have never experienced before, a grey swan in other words, and we think you should at least know about it,’ and to that extend this is the sort of study we want more of,” Holland said. The “grey swans” are not only projected to become more powerful in the coming decades, but the risk of them occurring is expected to increase due to climate change. For example, a hurricane with a 20-foot storm surge in Tampa currently has a likelihood of occurring once in every 10,000 years. By the end of the century the odds go up to once in every 2,500 to 700 years. The increase in likelihood is alarming but may not be enough to change how cities and regions prepare, said James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “The likelihood changing from one in 10,000 to one in 2,500 years is certainly a huge increase but one in 2,500 years over the 21st century may not be relevant in terms of how it might galvanize action on the ground,” Kossin said. Holland disagrees. “It’s something so likely to occur that you really can’t neglect the potential for this occurring,” Holland said. “If you are a town planner or a civil defense person that is looking out on a 40 or 50-year time frame you have to accept that this is a possibility.” The study comes as scientists gain a better understanding of the role warming oceans will play in tropical storms. A decade ago, most researchers assumed storm intensity and frequency would increase with warming waters, which play a key role in generating and sustaining such storms. But recently, assumptions about storm frequency have changed. A",

    "content": "Stay informed about the latest climate, energy and environmental justice news by email. Sign up for the ICN newsletter. Melting sea ice and warmer temperatures in the Arctic are to blame for the brutal cold snaps that have plagued parts of Asia and North America in recent years, according to new research by Korean and European scientists released Monday. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Geoscience, adds to the growing evidence linking rising Arctic temperatures to changing weather patterns across the globe. It also helps further debunk one of climate deniers‘ favorite arguments: cold weather proves the world isn’t warming from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Deniers reveled in their theory last winter as a record-breaking 110.6 inches of snow fell on Boston and temperatures as low as minus-35 degrees Fahrenheit chilled wide swaths of the Central Plains and Northeast. Republican Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe famously brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to “prove” his point and Republican Presidential frontrunner and businessman Donald Trump tweeted in February, “Record low temperatures and massive amounts of snow. Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING?“ “This research blasts enormous holes in that argument, if the deniers choose to pay attention to these findings,” said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey who was not involved in the research. The concept seems contradictory at first, warmer temperatures in one place causing cold winters in another. But the paper finds that a hotter, less icy Arctic—a region that has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the world over the last two decades—creates a bulge of warm air in the lower atmosphere that forces the jet stream to become wavier, dipping farther south in some places and peaking farther north in others as it moves eastward around the globe. As it dips south into latitudes lower than it used to, it carries with it cold Arctic air. Climate scientist and lead author of the paper Jong-Seong Kug of Pohang University in Korea and his colleagues found that warming north of western Russia creates colder winters in central Asia and warming north of western Alaska creates colder winters in eastern and central North America. The scientists triple-checked their findings using temperature and weather data from recent decades, jet stream simulation experiments and global climate models. Kug and his colleagues did not respond to requests for comment. Francis, who has studied the warming Arctic’s impact on the jet stream, said the study could help forecasters and disaster preparedness officials understand what kind of weather to expect in different parts of the world. “The results of this study also tell us that the year-to-year differences in the location of greatest ice loss and warming can help predict—and prepare for—severe winters in heavily populated mid-latitude regions,” she said. However, she also acknowledged that this year’s El Nino and extremely warm ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean could interfere with the warming Arctic-cold weather link this winter. “We’re in uncharted territory,” Francis said. “We don’t have a roadmap for the weather patterns that will occur in these conditions, but it’s safe to predict that ‘unusual’ will be a word that gets plenty of use.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2015-08-20T12:23:19-04:00",
    "content": "As California’s four-year drought has drinking and groundwater reserves at dangerously low levels, households rationing water and the agricultural sector struggling to keep its crops alive, the question has been: how much of a culprit is climate change? New research published Thursday now says as much as 27 percent of the drought can be attributed to global warming. That new research published in the peer-reviewed journal Geophysical Research Letters, by scientists at Columbia University and the University of Idaho, examines how quickly warming temperatures from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is sucking California’s soils and plants dry, a process known as evapotranspiration, and how drastically that process is increasing the severity of the current drought, said the study’s lead author, Park Williams, a Columbia bioclimatologist. “Climate change is like a bully,” Williams said. “Warmer temperatures steal moisture from California’s water budget like a bully would from a bank account. Every year, as temperatures continue to rise, they take more and more moisture away. In the beginning it isn’t really detectable, but after 120 years of warming, it is.” And with no rainfall to replace the moisture during periods of drought, he explained, this lack of soil moisture worsens dry conditions. The drought currently desiccating California has cost the state’s economy an estimated $2.7 billion in",

    "content": "Mapping something you can’t see seems like a quixotic pursuit, but that is exactly what some groups are trying to do around the country to highlight the unseen threat of natural gas leaks to the climate and environment. Google and the Environmental Defense Fund teamed last year to show methane leakage from natural gas lines in cities around the country, and now, a nonprofit in Cambridge, Mass., is getting into the act. The group, Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET), has located more than 20,000 leaks across Massachusetts and published maps showing the exact location of each and every leak. “I want to make the invisible visible,” said Audrey Schulman, president of HEET. “I want to allow people to understand that this isn’t a distant problem that doesn’t have to do with them. I want them to understand it’s on their street, it’s near their home, it’s near their school, and it’s near their business.” The problem with leaking natural gas from a climate perspective is that it consists primarily of methane, a relatively clean fossil fuel when burned, but a powerful greenhouse gas if emitted unburned into the atmosphere. Methane traps 86 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and is 34 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 over 100 years. Aging pipes that deliver natural gas under city streets are notoriously leaky but unless the leaks pose a safety hazard, utilities are not required to fix them. The mapping effort by HEET is an attempt to raise public awareness and help prioritize pipe replacements and repairs. Utilities often have little incentive to fix leaks. In Massachusetts, gas companies are allowed to pass on the cost of lost gas to their customers. The oldest leak in the state, one near Boston’s Fenway Park, has been emitting methane into the atmosphere since it was first reported in",

    "content": "This story was updated on Aug. 18 at 12:40 pm. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s first-ever proposal to reduce methane pollution, announced today, will not go far enough to reach reduction goals for the oil and gas industry, according to leading environmental organizations. The problem with the EPA’s proposal, the groups say, is making the reduction measures voluntary for existing oil and gas infrastructure and mandatory only for new or modified facilities. “There is an essential flaw in the notion that a voluntary program which is not going to get [100 percent] participation can really substitute for regulation,” said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director of the Clean Air Task Force. The EPA said it intended the proposed standards, which were first outlined in January, to be a first step toward cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40–45 percent from",

    "date": "2015-08-12T09:00:20-04:00",
    "content": "The American Legislative Exchange Council’s refusal to act on climate change has cost it another high-profile member: energy giant Royal Dutch Shell. But Shell’s departure comes at a curious time—it is trying to distance itself from a group known for climate change denial while still pressing ahead with climate-threatening Arctic drilling amid determined protests and opposition from a wide range of climate advocates. Shell made the announcement last Friday that it would not renew its membership, officially severing ties early next year with the conservative organization that has supported climate denial campaigns and opposed renewable energy initiatives. ALEC’s “stance on climate change is clearly inconsistent with our own,” Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, said in a statement. “We have long recognized both the importance of the climate challenge and the critical role energy has in determining quality of life for people across the world.” Although climate campaigners are pleased with the news, they question Shell’s timing and sincerity. Shell has recently faced large protests of “kayaktivists” in Seattle during the departure of its Arctic drilling fleet and most recently in Portland, where Greenpeace activists successfully kept the company’s Arctic-bound icebreaker, the Fennica, in port an extra day before it could leave to support the drilling in the Chukchi Sea. Greenpeace has led the protests over the climate implications of extracting Arctic oil. “I think it would be impossible for anybody to see [Shell] having left ALEC as anything other than a press stunt,” said Nick Surgey, director of research at the Center for Media and Democracy. “It’s been very clear for a long time what ALEC’s position is on climate change and corporations have been leaving ALEC in droves” in recent years, said Surgey. ALEC, a conservative group which gets a great deal of its funding from fossil fuel interests, has long opposed environmental action and has funded climate denial campaigns. It has recently tried to counter its image as an opponent of climate action, but it has not prevented the recent departures of major companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo and BP. Although suspicious of Shell’s motives, Kert Davies, executive director of Climate Investigations Center, said he was pleasantly surprised that Shell so clearly cited climate change as its reason for departing. Most of the big-name companies that have left haven’t explicitly said why. One glaring exception is Google, whose company chairman Eric Schmidt said in an interview with Diane Rehm last September that ALEC is “literally lying” about climate change. One of the groups most excited by Shell’s news is the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that advocates public policy based on science, has been pressuring the European oil giant to ditch ALEC since",

    "date": "2015-08-05T11:54:03-04:00",
    "content": "Waiting to tackle ocean acidification caused by climate change through yet-to-be developed geoengineering schemes will be too little too late to prevent mass extinction of ocean life, a new study concludes. Cutting carbon emissions is the only way for oceans to recover from the devastating effects of climate change, according to the new research published in Nature Climate Change. While using deliberate, large-scale manipulation of earth processes to combat global warming has its proponents, intervening in the climate through potentially dangerous geoengineering technologies is unproven. And even if carbon dioxide could be removed from the atmosphere, ocean acidification already spurred by CO2 will persist for centuries. This could cause mass extinctions of marine species, researchers concluded. “Once the ocean is severely affected by high carbon dioxide, it is virtually impossible to undo these alterations on a human-generation timescale,” said Sabine Mathesius of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. Mathesius and colleagues used computer modeling to simulate the effects of CO2 removal on ocean acidification under a high emissions, business-as-usual scenario. Acidification, or a decrease in the water’s pH level, occurs when CO2 is absorbed by seawater and reacts by producing acid. Increased ocean acidity harms a wide range of organisms including coral, mussels, clams, sea urchins, barnacles and microscopic plankton that use calcium carbonate, a mineral that dissolves with increased ocean acidity, to build their shells and other structures. Damage to coral reefs is one well-known example of the effects of increased ocean acidity, but such acidification affects all organisms that rely on calcium carbonate including coccolithophores, phytoplankton found in large numbers throughout the ocean. “They are really at the base of a lot of food chains,” said Steven Davis, an earth systems scientist at the University of California, Irvine. “If oceans are acidified those things are going to suffer and it could destabilize whole webs of the food chain.” The group looked at the effect of removing CO2 from the atmosphere at two rates. The first rate, 5 gigatons of carbon per year, equals half of today’s annual CO2 emissions. They then modeled a more aggressive rate of 25 gigatons of carbon per year, or 2.5 times current annual emissions. Even the higher removal rate, which the authors describe as “probably infeasible,” would be unable to return the oceans to preindustrial conditions by",

    "date": "2015-08-05T16:32:29-04:00",
    "content": "If enough states “just say no” to the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, refusing to impose limits on the carbon dioxide emissions of electric utilities within their borders, that could hasten the emergence of an interstate cap-and-trade regime designed by the federal government. This approach is spelled out in a proposed federal implementation plan published by the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday, alongside the final regulations that for the first time govern carbon pollution from power plants that burn fossil fuels. In the proposal, the agency outlines a model interstate emissions trading scheme that the states could adopt, or that the federal government would impose on any state that does not set up a compliance plan. That sends a powerful signal that even if recalcitrant states refused to comply with the regulations, electricity producers would still be required to steeply cut emissions, the leading source of climate-changing greenhouse gases. The EPA proposed that states use several tools—burning coal more efficiently, replacing it with natural gas or renewable energy, encouraging conservation of electricity and so on—based on “a reasonable assumption that all of those things can actually happen,” the agency said in documents released on Monday. “In the federal plan proposed in this action, the agency is ensuring that these things will happen.” The proposals for carbon emissions trading remain open for comment and revision, and would take a few years to put in place, offering time for opponents to challenge the overall Clean Power Plan in Congress or the courts. But as proposals, rather than final rules, these plans cannot yet be challenged directly in court. Several states and industry groups have already said they will challenge the overall Clean Power Plan, which was proposed last year and finalized on Monday. The National Mining Association has asked the EPA to stay the rule. Coal companies and attorneys general from several states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, also have said they will sue. They claim that the agency is overstepping its authority. Earlier this year, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, advised states to ignore the proposed rules. The governors of six states have suggested they will not comply with its timetable for writing state implementation plans, under deadlines that begin next year. The 755-page proposal and the model trading scheme it would incorporate was released along with the Clean Power Plan on Monday, giving the first glimpse at how the EPA would respond to state inaction. According to the proposal, if a state fails to submit a plan, the EPA will set a cap on how much carbon dioxide each power plant can emit while staying within a state’s overall target, a limit determined by the EPA in its final regulation. The agency will then create a cap-and-trade system that utilities can choose to participate in to make it easier to comply. Under such a plan, power plants that release less carbon than is allowed will generate credits that they can then sell to those power plants that exceed their allowances. “The EPA is very much interested in pushing the whole system toward trading,” said Daniel Selmi, an environmental law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California. The EPA, Selmi said, is building on its previous experience with trading. The agency first implemented a trading program in the early",

    "date": "2015-07-28T18:00:43-04:00",
    "content": "In a move to accelerate the spread of solar power in the United States, the nation’s largest residential solar installer launched a new offering Tuesday aimed at the underserved small- and medium-sized business market. SolarCity has grown quickly with a boost from new financing options for residential installations that have removed or significantly lowered the up-front costs. Now the company hopes to do the same thing for smaller commercial customers. SolarCity said it will start in its home state of California, targeting businesses with 5,000 to 50,000 square feet of available flat roof space for solar systems that will generate between 30 and 500 kilowatts of power at a cost 5 to 20 percent below California market rates. The business would have a fixed lease payment over the life of the 20-year contract. The company eventually hopes to expand beyond California and offer service to a market that includes more than 28 million small and medium-sized businesses nationwide. For years, that market has largely been left to smaller, local solar companies because costs and financing challenges made the market unattractive for the national solar installers such as SolarCity and SunEdison, according to SolarCity chief executive officer Lyndon Rive. The company’s chairman is Elon Musk, founder of Paypal and Tesla, the electric car and renewable energy company. For its large business and government installations, SolarCity worked with subcontractors to perform the work—which is too expensive for smaller commercial projects, according to Rive. That and limited access to credit to finance the work has caused the smaller business market to lag behind installation rates for residential and corporate customers, said Rive, who noted, “We think we’ve cracked the nut on both of those.” Rive said SolarCity will cut the cost of serving that market 30 percent by using its own crews and technology to speed up installation and fit more solar panels on each roof. In California, solar leasing customers can now tap into the state’s Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, which allows businesses and residents investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy to add the costs onto property tax bills as an assessment. Late last year, California expanded the program to include leased solar transactions too. The PACE program allows customers to begin saving on energy bills without paying the full cost up front. The energy savings is meant to more than offset the larger property tax bills. The payments can also be tax deductible along with the property taxes. Eventually, SolarCity expects small- and medium-sized businesses to be the second-largest market for rooftop solar. But, Rive said, the market “needs time to mature.” The announcement comes a day before the company releases its second-quarter earnings, which will show that the fast-growing company is not yet profitable. Last quarter, SolarCity posted a net loss of $147 million. The company, founded in",

    "content": "With the Obama administration poised to issue its sweeping rules to cut carbon pollution from power plants, a Texas-based conservative think tank is making a far-fetched bid to quash the new regulations. The latest effort shows the extraordinary lengths that opponents of Obama’s Clean Power Plan will go to scuttle the administration’s effort to slash emissions. This long-shot proposal is one of several designed to give state lawmakers tools to stymie or grandstand against the regulations, which could be issued as soon as Monday. The Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), a group connected to the Koch brothers’ network, is floating what it calls an Interstate Power Compact, a proposal that would give states constitutional authority to ignore the Clean Power Plan. An interstate compact is a binding contract between two or more states that is similar to a treaty and requires Congressional approval. “We are promoting an all-of- the-above strategy for states to express discontent with the [Clean Power Plan], and it seemed like there was a role for interstate compacts,” said Doug Domenech, director of the Fueling Freedom Project at the TPPF. The proposal is the latest in a slew of ongoing attacks by Republican legislators, conservative advocacy groups and fossil fuel interests against the Clean Power Plan, the cornerstone of Obama’s climate agenda and a key for helping the nation meet the president’s Paris treaty pledge. Opponents—led by coal companies and states—have mounted legal challenges, set up roadblocks by coordinating action in state legislatures and openly called on states to refuse to comply. “This seems to be a new novel approach [to circumvent the Clean Power Plan],” said Shannon Fisk, managing attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental group. But “it’s not a real threat.” Interstate compacts are not uncommon. Today, more than 200 of them exist, with states, on average, belonging to 25 interstate compacts. They are used to establish regulatory agencies operating in more than one state, set up commissions to study problems affecting several states and implement regulations on a broad range of issues including agriculture, flood control and education.

    "date": "2015-07-31T09:00:55-04:00",
    "content": "Three hundred sixty-five companies and investors sent letters on Friday to more than two dozen governors supporting the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to significantly reduce carbon emissions from power plants, urging even the most recalcitrant states to recognize the economic and environmental benefits of the new rules. The Clean Power Plan, expected to be issued in final form as early as Monday, has drawn significant opposition, particularly from Republicans and the fossil fuel industry, but the corporate push counters the argument that the regulations are bad for American business. “These standards…are critical for moving our country toward a clean energy economy,” the companies wrote. The letters represent the largest backing by American business owners to date for the Obama administration’s regulations, the signature component of his agenda on climate change. They also come just days before the agency is expected to finalize the carbon rules. Signatories range from local businesses like Sixpoint Brewery in Brooklyn to Fortune 500 conglomerates like Staples, Gap, L’Oreal and Nestle. Most of the companies that signed on to the campaign have been adopting sustainability measures for years with no negative impact, said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a Boston-based non-profit that works with the business community on sustainability and climate change issues; Ceres organized the campaign. “Our support [of the Clean Power Plan] is firmly grounded in economic reality,” the companies wrote. “Evidence shows that emissions reductions can be achieved without long-term economic harm or damage to the reliability of our electricity system.” The letter also said that businesses need “clear and consistent” climate policies to manage risk and transition to a clean energy economy. “The rhetoric is out there that the Clean Power Plan is bad for business, but that is absolutely not the case,” Mark Buckley, vice president of environmental affairs at Staples Inc., told InsideClimate News. The office supply store has invested in renewable energy and increased energy efficiency for nearly 14 years. “We’ve only seen benefits from this strategy,” Buckley said. Letters were sent to governors in 29 states that had at least 10 companies participating in the campaign headquartered or operating there. Several of the carbon rules’ biggest opponents made the list, such as Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin, all three of which are challenging the legality of the EPA plan in court. Texas, another recipient, has signaled it might also sue when the rules are finalized. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has been a particularly vehement opponent, saying “the regulation would likely shrink [his state’s] economy by almost $2 billion and throw countless out of work.” But the campaign also targeted states that are strong supporters of the Clean Power Plan, including California, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. “This effort will add an extra layer of support for the governors or lawmakers already on board with the plan,” said Stu Dalheim, vice president of shareholder advocacy at Calvert Investments, a firm that specializes in socially and environmentally responsible companies and a signatory of the letter. “But it could also maybe help convince those who are not on board.” Lubber of Ceres said the Clean Power Plan’s success is crucial if the U.S. wants to be a “key leader and player” in international climate negotiations in Paris this December.

    "date": "2015-07-23T08:00:07-04:00",
    "content": "About 80 billion cubic feet of the potent greenhouse gas methane escapes into the air each year from the complex U.S. system for carrying natural gas to power stations and other consumers, according to new research published this week. That would be enough to satisfy South Dakota’s natural gas needs for an entire year, with a value of $240 million. Researchers led by scientists at Colorado State University in Fort Collins found that 0.35 percent of the methane in natural gas transmission and storage sites leaks into the atmosphere, about what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates. At the same time, the study found that 4 percent of the facilities surveyed accounted for 23 percent of the the leaked emissions, demonstrating the prevalence of so-called “super emitter” stations. The scientists estimated that 1 in every 25 facilities among thousands across the country is a super emitter. The findings were published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science and Technology. “This study reiterates what several other recent studies have found: A few leaks can dominate the methane emissions coming from the natural gas supply system,” said Amy Townsend-Small, a geologist at the University of Cincinnati who studies methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The study is part of an ambitious, four-year-old methane research program led by the Environmental Defense Fund. The environmental organization is coordinating an $18 million series with industry of 16 studies by more than 100 researchers investigating the booming natural gas industry’s climate footprint as gas increasingly supplants coal in America’s energy portfolio. Policymakers often champion natural gas as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions and fight climate change while the U.S. moves away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. But scientific studies have suggested that the amount of methane—a greenhouse gas 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide—leaking from the largely unregulated natural gas production and transportation industry could eliminate any climate benefits. “Natural gas operators are not required to find and address methane leaks,” said Jonathan Peress, director of EDF’s air quality program for natural gas. The discovery of so many high-methane sites confirms the “need for a rigorous leak detection and repair regulatory program,” he said. Led by Dan Zimmerle, director of Colorado State University’s Electric Power Systems Laboratory, the scientists partnered with seven oil and gas companies—including Dominion, Kinder Morgan and TransCanada—to gain access to drilling sites across the country. They also used other companies’ data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. In total, they analyzed methane emissions and drilling activity from 1,599 facilities, representing more than one-third of all transmission and storage sites in the U.S. The team examined leaks only from storage sites and compressor stations, the points at which natural gas is pressurized for transport through pipelines. They did not measure leaks from the pipelines themselves because it would have been too time- and labor-intensive, Zimmerle said. Because the study relies on modeling to create nationwide emissions estimates, there are inherent uncertainties, said Frank Flocke, an atmospheric chemist and air quality expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo. Yet the study “is a fairly solid approach” to measuring leaks in this part of the natural gas infrastructure, he said. The study found significant discrepancies between what companies report to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and what actually leaks from facilities. Sites required to participate in the federal program—those that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent annually—leaked 2.5 times more methane than they disclosed to the EPA, the study found. This is because the EPA does not require every single piece of equipment at storage and transmission sites to be monitored for leaks, Zimmerle said. In addition, the program does not account for super emitters, which may release methane at increased rates for only a short time. Although the EPA currently does not use most of this reported data for the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions inventory, that could soon change, said David Lyon, an emissions scientist helping to lead EDF’s methane project. Until it does, this discrepancy could affect the accuracy of the inventory, which is used to inform international climate negotiations and track U.S. progress on fighting global warming. While Zimmerle’s study and others from the EDF methane project have helped quantify the natural gas industry’s methane problem, there are still unknowns about the system and its climate impact, said Flocke, the NCAR scientist. “What it really boils down to is we still don’t have a really good handle on this, except that we know quite a bit of methane goes into the atmosphere,” Flocke said. “The whole discussion of whether this is a good bridge fuel—you’re still emitting CO2, you’re just not making as much. But that doesn’t mean methane is going to save the world from getting warmer. If we really want to prevent the Earth from becoming a hell hole, we need to switch off fossil fuels completely, including natural gas.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "The Texas flooding in May that pulled houses off foundations and swamped city streets provided a glimpse of what scientists have long warned could be its new norm because of global warming. But it did nothing to sway the state’s politicians, who have done next to nothing to adjust to a climate that is already bringing more damaging extreme weather. Scientist have warned for years that Texas will suffer from longer and hotter periods of drought punctuated by heavier, more damaging rainfall as the world warms from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Add sea level rise along its coasts, and the state is one of the most vulnerable in the U.S. to the effects of climate change, alongside Florida, Louisiana and the mid-Atlantic region, according to climate scientists. Amid signs that this pattern of weather extremes may already be starting to take hold, Texas leaders—largely conservative Republicans—have ignored calls from scientists, urban planning experts and environmental leaders to adopt policies to address it. And homeowners continue to rebuild homes right back in the areas hardest hit by those extremes. “We have this massive coastline vulnerable to sea level rise, but we also have tornado alley, hurricane alley with all the Atlantic storms, and flash flood alley,” said Kate Zerrenner, the head of the Environmental Defense Fund’s climate and energy project, who is based in Texas. “If we’re not careful in planning for our future, we will come out at a major disadvantage.” Measures to enhance climate resiliency are still rare as most interior U.S. states have yet to develop climate adaptation plans. Texas, however, is one of only a handful of coastal states not to have a plan published or in development. That is worrisome because of the state’s size and exposure to severe climate effects, scientists and climate policy experts said. A majority of Texas lawmakers still don’t concede that climate change is caused by human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. In a",

    "date": "2015-06-10T19:00:45-04:00",
    "content": "A journal publisher that distributed studies written by a climate skeptic whose work was financed by fossil fuel interests has launched an ethics investigation over undisclosed funding. The investigation by Elsevier, a global network of scientific journals, was prompted by documents showing that Harvard-Smithsonian scientist Willie Soon failed to disclose industry funding in 11 studies published by nine journals. Six of those papers were published in four Elsevier publications. Elsevier requires its authors to disclose financial conflicts that “could inappropriately influence, or be perceived to influence, their work.” The documents were obtained by Greenpeace and made public in February by the Climate Investigations Center, an environmental watchdog organization based in Virginia. After the documents were released, the center alerted the journals that the lack of disclosure violates ethical guidelines requiring authors to identify their funders and potential conflicts of interest. “We applaud your guidelines for ethical behavior in science, but we are concerned that your conflict of interest policy has been ignored and that Dr. Soon may have hidden his funding,” wrote Kert Davies, the center’s executive director, in letters to the journals. “Violations of ethical norms in scientific publishing may undermine the credibility of your journal.” Elsivier’s ethics inquiry was made public in a report issued by the center Wednesday that includes the responses from all nine journals. “We have referred the matter to Elsevier and they have an ethics team investigating,” Rob Hyndman, editor of International Journal of Forecasting, said in a response to Davies. “We will not be taking any action until we have received advice from the Elsevier ethics investigators.” Chris Capot, a spokesman for Elsevier, confirmed the investigation, but declined to discuss the nature of the review or any potential outcomes. “The review is still ongoing. The results of our review will be published in any affected journals,” Capot said. In addition to the Elsevier inquiry, one publication, Journal of Climate, amended a",

    "date": "2015-06-10T16:14:30-04:00",
    "content": "More than 100 North American scientists released a consensus statement on Wednesday concluding that mining in Canada’s tar sands region is destroying the local environment, endangering the rights of indigenous groups and threatening the world’s ability to fight climate change—and urging Canadian leaders to curtail their development. Their statement, 18 months in the making and the first to specifically take a stance on the oil sands, said further development would make it impossible to stave off dangerous levels of climate change. They sent the analysis to Canada’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper and members of Parliament, and requested meetings to discuss the findings. “We offer a unified voice calling for a moratorium on new oil sands projects,” the scientists wrote. “Continued expansion of oil sands and similar unconventional fuels in Canada and beyond is incompatible with limiting climate warming to a level that society can handle without widespread harm.” Signatories to the statement include climate scientists, economists, geophysicists and biologists from dozens of U.S. and Canadian universities and private institutions. Among them are 12 fellows of the Royal Society of Canada, 22 members of the U.S. National Academy, five recipients of the Order of Canada, and a Nobel Prize winner, Stanford University economist Kenneth Arrow. Other signatories include James Hansen, the former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the earliest climate science advocates; Stanford conservation biologist Paul Ehrlich; climate scientist Michael Mann of Penn State University; and atmospheric scientist Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “This is a remarkable coalescing of folks who have had quite different positions on other issues ideologically, and even on climate change, but are speaking in a unified voice on oil sands,” said Thomas Homer-Dixon, a lead author and an expert on global security threats, including climate change, at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. “It is really important to clear up a lot of the misinformation that has been promulgated about the oil sands,” said Homer-Dixon. “The document states things really unequivocally. It helps clarify what scientists actually know about tar sands issues like the ability to restore the landscape after mining and tar sands’ relationship to climate targets.” The oil sands are large deposits of a heavy crude oil known as bitumen. The tar-like substance is more difficult to clean up when it spills than other types of fuel, and emits 17 percent more greenhouse gases over its life-cycle than conventional crude oil. The statement identified 10 reasons for a ban, including the widespread poisoning of nearby forests and waterways resulting from lax environmental regulations. The statement noted that less than 0.2 percent of the land affected by tar sands mining has been reclaimed or restored to its original state. The scientists also concluded the tar sands threaten the culture and livelihoods of aboriginal communities living near the mining sites. Fossil fuel companies currently produce two million barrels of oil sands crude per day in Alberta. The Canadian government and fossil fuel companies plan to ramp up production to six million barrels per day by",

Rep. Marjorie Decker and Sen. Benjamin Downing, both Democrats, have proposed identical bills to divest Massachusetts’ $62.3 billion public pension fund of its 8 percent holdings (about $5 billion) in coal, oil and natural gas. Tuesday, the Joint Committee on Public Service held a nearly three-hour public hearing on the issue. More than 70 students, public school teachers, retirees, financial analysts, public officials, labor and environmental activists, as well as legislative aides, vied for seating and standing room along the wall of a first-floor room of the State House. About 20 people testified; most supported divestment. The first to speak was Decker, a representative from Cambridge. Rep. Decker told how she had served nearly a decade in public office before the importance of climate change action really sank in. Sitting next to Decker was her young daughter. Decker said this is the first time her daughter has accompanied her to work, and it’s because preschool just ended. But “it is important she’s here,” Decker said, to understand “the sense of urgency I feel around this.” Sen. Downing was the second to testify. Massachusetts has “taken important steps over the last decade to transition away from fossil fuels,” he said. Downing noted that the state is first in the nation in energy efficiency and in clean-energy job growth. He then praised the state’s uptake in solar: In",

    "title": "Pope Francis’s Climate Encyclical: Next Comes the Hard Part",
    "date": "2015-06-17T11:00:17-04:00",
    "content": "When Pope Francis releases his highly anticipated encyclical on global warming Thursday, titled “Laudato Si,” or “Be Praised,” he will call on nations to take immediate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions on ethical grounds—cementing climate action as a pressing moral issue and sending a jolt through efforts to forge a global climate deal in Paris in December. But keeping the momentum going will fall to church leaders and organizations, who now face the monumental task of translating the papal teaching document’s nearly 200 pages of dense, pedantic language into layman’s terms, and engaging the world’s 1.1 billion Catholics to agitate for action on the ground. “Now comes the hard part,” said Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of NETWORK, a Catholic social justice organization. Over the next several months, dozens of U.S. Catholic groups will write op-eds, hold press conferences, meet with policymakers and even create book club-like guides to the text. Thousands of priests and bishops will periodically receive toolkits that demonstrate how a certain week’s scheduled scripture relates to environmental degradation and climate change. Some Catholic universities are already discussing making the encyclical mandatory reading. Other religious groups, including Jews and Evangelical Christians, have also used the pending encyclical to ramp up discussion of climate change in their own communities. Encyclicals are high-level Catholic teaching documents written by a pope and meant to guide Catholics’ actions for decades to come. Most of them end up sitting on a shelf, said Patrick Carolan, executive director of the Franciscan Action Network, a grassroots group that advocates for issues such as alleviating poverty and advancing human rights. Church leaders and theologians may talk about them, but they rarely get attention in the wider world, he said. This papal document is different. “I’ve never seen a buzz [like this] around an encyclical my whole life,” said Carolan, who added that the buzz is coming not just from Catholics, but from “people of all faiths and environmental groups.” But leaders know they have to act fast and aggressively to take full advantage of the intense interest in the encyclical right now. Until this point, the Vatican has spearheaded efforts to publicize the encyclical, arranging meetings with government officials, hosting a climate and global development summit last month and publishing a summary of climate science called “Climate change and the common good: A statement of the problem and the demand for transformative solutions.” Pope Francis is expected to continue incorporating climate change into his speeches, and staffers in Vatican embassies across the globe will meet with government officials about the document. As the world’s smallest country, Vatican City will also participate in the Paris climate treaty talks. Pope Francis is expected to attend and play a role in the negotiations. But once the encyclical is published, experts said, the Vatican is largely expected to take a step back from the document itself and let its network of pastors, scholars and non-profit workers take the reins. “The Vatican is a global church and it would be difficult to suggest a one size fits all approach,” said Daniel Misleh, executive director of the Catholic Climate Covenant, a network of 15 Catholic organizations pushing climate action. Very Little Pushback The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), a group representing the Catholic heirarchy in the U.S., including more than 650 active and retired cardinals, bishops and archdioceses, held a session during its annual spring meeting earlier this month to discuss the document and strategize ways to teach it to its roughly 78 million parishioners. Archbishop of Miami Thomas Wenski, who co-organized the session, said he’s seen very little pushback to the encyclical from his colleagues. The document echoes sentiments on climate change that the USCCB aired a decade ago, he said. “If you accept Catholic moral tradition, you have to pay attention to what the pope is saying,” said Wenski. “You really can’t disagree [with the encyclical] and call yourself a Catholic.” Wenski said he’s also optimistic about how the encyclical will be received at the local level, especially given the Pope’s “rock star quality” that has “generated a lot of fervor and around [the document’s] release.” A version of the encyclical was leaked earlier this week by an Italian newspaper, but the Vatican said the text was only a draft. The USCCB will be collaborating with the Catholic Climate Covenant—an umbrella group of Catholic organizations working for climate action—on a series of events around the country this summer and fall with religious and environmental leaders to discuss local climate impacts and solutions. The agenda includes sea level rise in Miami, agriculture in Des Moines, Iowa, energy efficiency in Cincinnati and drought in Sacramento, Calif. The two organizations will also be producing “homily help” for priests, guides on how to incorporate the encyclical and climate change into weekly sermons and church bulletins, said Misleh. The packages will go out to an estimated 17,000 parishes across the U.S. The Catholic Climate Covenant is also partnering with Green Faith, an interfaith coalition for environmental stewardship, and RENEW International, a Catholic organization fostering religious discussion, to develop a 12-week series that can be used by small groups of people to study and discuss the encyclical, climate change and religious imperative to care for the earth. Campbell said NETWORK will tout the pope’s argument that climate change disproportionately impacts low-income communities through a series of speeches and events across the country in the coming months. It will also hold roundtables with business leaders on how to clean up the environment, as well as send people to Washington, D.C. to speak with senators and representatives about climate change. The Franciscan Action Network is collaborating with the World Wildlife Fund and the Sierra Club to bring the pope’s message to the millions of members of mainstream environmental groups through webinars and other educational activities. One college—Loyola University Maryland—has already decided to require its students read the encyclical, said Erin Lothes, a theologian at the College of Saint Elizabeth in Morristown, N.J. Most of the more than 200 Catholic colleges and universities in the country are also likely to incorporate the teaching document into course curriculum, she said. State-level Catholic conferences, such as the New York State Catholic Conference, that work directly with state legislators to write laws and policies on issues the church cares about, such as social justice, education and abortion, will add climate change to its priority list, Lothes said. The Global Catholic Climate Movement—a coalition of 100 Catholic organizations co-founded by Carolan of the Franciscan Action Network—is also putting together “parish toolkits” of resources and ideas meant to stimulate discussions among parishioners. Carolan said he hopes it will encourage people to make individual choices for the environment, such as eating less meat, as well as going a step further to green their parishes or to influence public policy. Father Jacek Orzechowski, a priest at St. Camillus in Silver Spring, Md., said the encyclical will allow his parish to “continue to challenge ourselves” on sustainability and climate action. Orzechowski, who is chair of the Justice, Peace and Integrity of Creation Directorate for the Franciscans of the Holy Name Province (a group of Franciscan friars on the East coast of the U.S.), said his parish is very active in engaging environmental justice as a moral issue. Members have participated in rallies against mineral mining in El Salvador, and several parishioners, including Orzechowski, were arrested in an anti-Keystone XL pipeline sit-in before the White House. About half of his parish is Latino, Orzechowski said, and there’s also a sizable community from Bangladesh, a country that will be hard hit by rising sea levels. The Challenge in Washington Catholic leaders and organizations know there’s a significant possibility that members of Congress and others who deny the scientific evidence climate change could prove a challenge in their efforts to teach the encyclical. Republican Catholic politicians are unlikely to listen to Pope Francis, and some have already criticized him for taking a stance on the issue. Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, a devout Catholic and former Pennsylvania senator, said the pope should “leave science to the scientists.” At the invitation of Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner of Ohio, Pope Francis is scheduled to address Congress on Sept. 28. Climate change is expected to play a central role in his remarks—further throwing the encyclical into the political arena. But Catholic leaders said they remain hopeful that won’t happen––or that the disinformation campaign on climate action will be isolated to D.C. and conservative media, and left out of churches. Climate science is something that “moves heads,” said William Dinges, a professor of religion and culture at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, D.C. The encyclical can “move hearts and legs” by connecting the dots between climate change and morality, he said. “Precious few voices in this world have as much moral influence as Pope Francis,” said Christiana Peppard, an expert on Catholic environmental ethics at Fordham University in the Bronx.

    "date": "2015-05-28T11:00:14-04:00",
    "content": "Sharp differences are emerging between U.S. oil majors and their European brethren on the issue of climate change, and Wednesday’s shareholder meetings at ExxonMobil and Chevron underscored the divergence as they fought all climate-related shareholder proposals and came away largely victorious. The stiff resistance from Exxon and Chevron came in contrast to recent annual meetings at BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil, where nearly identical climate-related shareholder resolutions passed almost unanimously after the three companies opted to support the measure instead of oppose it. In the wake of the unprecedented climate votes in Europe, some hoped to see a shift in the U.S. too. Exxon and Chevron executives, however, showed no sign of taking a more cooperative stance with shareholder groups worried about climate change. At this year’s Exxon meeting in Dallas, Chief Executive Rex Tillerson didn’t mention climate change in his prepared remarks to shareholders, a change from previous years, one shareholder noted. “How startling that the industry has taken a split on this,” said Sister Pat Daly, who was at Exxon’s meeting representing the Roman Catholic Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell, N.J. “But we’re not going away.” Daly’s group co-sponsored a proposal asking the oil company to set companywide goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the ninth straight year. The measure failed, drawing support from less than 10 percent of the vote. In response to shareholder questions, Tillerson reiterated his views that climate change represents another risk among many that the company manages; that the ramifications of global warming are unclear because “the [scientific] models simply are not that good”; and that technology advances will provide “engineered solutions” to address whatever problems emerge. He said Exxon isn’t interested in diversifying by investing in renewable energy. Without subsidies, “they really don’t make money,” said Tillerson. “We choose not to lose money on purpose.” Michael Crosby, a friar from Milwaukee’s Roman Catholic Province of St. Joseph of the Capuchin Order, countered that renewable energy is competitive and that fossil fuels receives subsidies too. “We don’t receive any subsidies,” Tillerson said, though the company takes advantage of tax breaks that are provided to many industries. The shareholder resolution that won the most support at both Exxon and Chevron asks for a new bylaw allowing qualifying shareholders to nominate board members. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer submitted that resolution for votes at many publicly traded U.S. oil companies, noting that existing board members are not addressing shareholder concerns about how the companies will mitigate the long-term threats posed by climate change. The proxy access resolution (so named because board nominations and ballots are contained in company proxy statements) got a majority vote of 55 percent at Chevron and 49.4 percent at Exxon. Since shareholder proposals are advisory, it’s up to the companies to decide whether or how to respond to the results. If they adopt the resolution’s language, shareholders owning at least 3 percent of a company’s stock for at least three years can nominate people for a limited number of board seats. In a tweet, Stringer called the Chevron vote “a huge victory for shareowners.” Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said in a statement, “The board will consider the final voting results carefully, including the vote on proxy access and the thoughtful stockholder discussions on that issue.” Huge victory for shareowners at @chevron. 55% of investors favor having a say in how corporate boards are elected! @calpers @nyscomptroller — Scott M.

The California State Parent Teacher Association, which represents nearly 1 million parents and educators, adopted a resolution this month to urge schools to prioritize climate curriculum and improve energy efficiency, as well as to lobby lawmakers to act on climate warming. The group plans to bring the resolution to the National Parent Teacher Association for adoption as early as next year. If that were to happen, it would mean that millions of parents in school districts across the country would be pushing for improved climate education and legislation at a time when both face serious opposition from conservative groups. “People tend to blow off the PTA,” said Minda Berbeco, programs and policy director at the National Center for Science Education, an Oakland, Calif., not-for-profit group that works to protect evolution and climate science in schools. “But if the PTA supports something, it is hard for politicians and community leaders to go against it. It would mean going against the wishes of the majority of the parents in their state or district.” The resolution frames the issue of climate change as a significant threat to children. “There is broad scientific consensus among climate scientists that human activities contributing to greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of climate warming since",

    "date": "2015-05-11T10:00:57-04:00",
    "content": "Climate denial campaigns have helped slow the public’s acceptance of man-made climate change and delay political action for years, but a new study published last Thursday finds these contrarian arguments have also had an impact on climate scientists. Scientists spend time and resources addressing denialists’ debunked claims in a way the scientific community has never done, said Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive scientist at the University of Bristol in England and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Global Environmental Change. Researchers also often downplay future climate risks to avoid being labeled an “alarmist” by climate contrarians. “Scientists are reticent to begin with, and if they know that everyone wants to ream at them for being alarmists, that adds to their reticence,” Lewandowsky said. “They are human, just like you and I…and some of the actions by deniers can be quite nasty.” He said hate mail and complaints directed to their research institutions are common. This influence, which the study dubbed “seepage,” is something that Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo. has seen first-hand. Climate denial campaigns “can absolutely influence what you do and what you write about,” said Trenberth, who was not involved in the study. “Part of the reason they do it is to distract you and get you to waste your time.” Instead of “publishing the good science needed to advance our understanding of climate change,” scientists are left defending their work and debunking false claims. The study reviewed dozens of psychological and social science papers to understand why scientists are susceptible to denialist campaigns and provided a real-world example of this impact from the climate science literature. The authors concluded that scientists are as vulnerable as anyone to persuasive messaging and fear being stereotyped (in this case, as a global warming alarmist), and that when enough people criticize or question their work they, too, may begin questioning their findings. The example it examined is the scientific community’s handling of the claim that there’s been a supposed pause or hiatus in the world’s warming in the last decade. Lewandowsky, along with Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes and colleagues at several Australian universities examined more than 40 scientific studies that addressed the slowed warming trend.

O’Hanlon was one of nearly 200 people that participated in a 32-day sit-in on Swarthmore’s campus outside of Philadelphia calling for the school’s divestment of fossil fuel holdings. The protest ended on April 20 after administrators agreed to discuss the issue at an upcoming board meeting. Since January, students at Swarthmore and nine other schools with endowments totaling more than $72 billion participated in sit-ins as a way to express their support for divestment. Following the school’s announcement, climate journalist-turned-activist Bill McKibben wrote in a tweet that the Swarthmore students “have worked longer and harder than just about anyone in [the] climate fight” and called the decision by Swarthmore’s Board of Managers a “corporatist disgrace.” This is the second time in recent years that Swarthmore’s Board of Managers has voted against divestment. The board vetoed the first community proposal in",

The results could have major implications for federal policies as the Obama administration moves to regulate methane from the natural gas industry. The research paper raises serious questions about the validity of existing methane data. Measurements taken by the instrument are frequently used by the Environmental Protection Agency to estimate industrial releases of methane—a greenhouse gas dozens of time more potent than carbon dioxide. In fact, the EPA lists the device as an approved tool that oil and gas companies can use to measure and report their methane emissions. “It could be a big deal,” especially if it turns out the EPA is underestimating methane leaks, said study co-author Amy Townsend-Small, a geology professor at the University of Cincinnati. The paper was published in late March in the peer-reviewed Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association. The instrument in question is the Bacharach Hi-Flow Sampler sold by Bacharach Inc.

    "date": "2015-05-01T11:00:54-04:00",
    "content": "As Pope Francis steps up his moral campaign for global action on climate change, Republican Roman Catholics in Congress are more likely to listen to fossil fuel interests and party leaders than their pontiff, religious and political researchers say, based on lawmakers’ track records. The pope hosted a global warming summit at the Vatican this week with economists, scientists and religious and government leaders. The global leader of the Catholic Church plans this summer to issue the first-ever encyclical, a high-level Catholic teaching document, devoted to global warming and its effects on the world’s poor. But as much sway as the pope has with a sixth of the world’s population, party doctrine will probably trump church doctrine in Congress, experts told InsideClimate News. The position of Pope Francis on climate change—and nearly every mainstream climate scientist—bucks that of American conservatives and fossil fuel interests such as the billionaire Koch brothers, who have spent millions of dollars casting doubt on the reality of human-driven climate change and supporting candidates who oppose action to address it. “If the science hasn’t persuaded Republican politicians, the Pope won’t,” said R.L. Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote, a super PAC that works to elect climate-conscious candidates. “American Catholics have been in the habit of mixing and matching parts of Catholic doctrine when it suits them for decades. I don’t see this as an exception.” The pope’s doctrinal statement will come as world leaders prepare to meet in December in Paris on global warming. They plan to hash out an international accord to fight climate change and address the needs of billions of poor people who suffer from the worst effects of warming. It also comes at a time when fossil fuel divestment campaigns are sweeping college campuses across the nation and the world. Like the pope, divestment activists have the goal of turning global warming action into the moral issue of this generation. Campaigns are underway at 500 colleges. Thirty schools worldwide—along with 41 cities, 72 religious institutions, 30 foundations and hundreds of individuals—have divested or pledged to divest from fossil fuels. “Morality moves politicians. Politicians can dodge policy questions, it’s harder to dodge a question like, ‘why are you choosing Exxon over our kids?’ said Jamie Henn, director of strategy and co-founder of 350.org, the environmental group behind the divestment movement. “When climate is about widgets and circuits, you lose people. When it’s about our health, our families, and our future, you start seeing people in the streets.” Catholics make up nearly 32 percent of the House of Representatives and 26 percent of the Senate, compared with 22 percent of the U.S. population. The list of Catholics in Congress includes several of the GOP’s most prominent climate denialists, such as presidential contender Marco Rubio, a Florida senator; House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio; and former vice presidential candidate and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Likely presidential contenders Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana are also Catholic. Those three question the science of human-caused global warming and oppose climate policy. No Republican politician has yet commented on the pope’s climate agenda, but conservatives such as the Heartland Institute, a right-wing tank that has received funding from the Kochs, have lambasted the Catholic leader’s efforts. The Heartland Institute sent a group of climate denialists to Rome earlier this week to, “inform Pope Francis of the truth about climate science: There is no global warming crisis!” according to a press release. Just nine journalists showed up to its press event. At the invitation of Boehner, Pope Francis will address Congress in September, shortly after the publication of his climate encyclical. Rubio, Boehner and Ryan, among others, will probably ignore the pope’s calls for action in favor of following the Republican party line on climate change, political researchers said. None responded to InsideClimate News’ requests for comment. On the other side of the aisle, Catholics including House minority leader Nancy Pelosi of California, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, may use the encyclical to bolster their party’s climate agenda, the researchers said. “If you ask any politician, most say their faith is central to what they do,” said Dan Cox, director of research at the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit organization that examines the intersection of religion, values and public life. “But when you look at specific issues, like the death penalty and abortion, you’re better off knowing their party then their religion.” Invoking Their Faith Still, Catholic politicians, particularly Republicans, have a history of invoking their faith to justify policy decisions.

    "content": "Last month, more than 30 students at Swarthmore College tried an increasingly popular tactic to pressure their school to divest its $1.9 billion endowment of fossil fuels: a sit-in in the hallway of the administration’s office. Thirty-two days and more than 200 protesters later, officials at the 151-year-old liberal arts college near Philadelphia finally agreed to discuss divestment at a board meeting in May. Since January, Swarthmore and nine other schools with endowments totaling more than $72 billion have been beset with campus sit-ins. Those students are urging their universities to join the 30 schools worldwide—along with 41 cities, 72 religious institutions, 30 foundations and hundreds of individuals—that have divested or pledged to divest from fossil fuels. Most recently, the staff at SOAS, University of London pledged April 24 to divest their fossil fuel holdings over the next three years. These so-called “escalation” efforts, according to those involved with the campaigns, have involved thousands of students, alumni and community members in eight states over 70 days. “We were pleased with the movement on the Swarthmore campus, but not surprised,” said Jenny Marienau, the U.S. divestment campaign organizer at the green group 350.org that’s helped the movement grow. For the last three years, the student divestment group Swarthmore Mountain Justice has been building support from students, alumni, faculty and the community, she said. The primary argument for divestment is: “If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage,” according to 350.org‘s website. Divestment involves selling off stocks and bonds tied to oil, natural gas and coal companies, and can take months to years. Swarthmore’s divestment group had been plotting the sit-in for months in coordination with similar student groups at colleges across the country. Since the school’s sit-in launched in March, it inspired similar actions on other campuses such as the University of Mary Washington, in Fredericksburg, Va. The Swarthmore protest has received endorsements from high profile alumni, such as Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a",

    "content": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.––As top-notch experts met at Harvard University to discuss global warming impacts and solutions Monday, dozens of Harvard students and alumni held protests encouraging the university to divest from fossil fuels. The two events––one organized by Harvard’s Office of the President, the other by students, alumni and environmental activists––share a common concern, but they highlight a rift over how the university should address climate change. The Presidential Panel on Climate Change brought scientific and public policy leaders to a sold-out event at Harvard’s 1,000-seat Sanders Theater. For more than an hour, the speakers, moderated by broadcaster Charlie Rose, discussed climate science, policies and solutions. Meanwhile, divestment activists continued various sit-ins on campus to pressure the administration to shed its oil, gas and coal assets. Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust has repeatedly said the university will not divest. The panelists began by summarizing the urgency of the climate crisis and describing what needs to be done. John Holdren, a White House adviser to the president on science and technology, said President Obama is fully committed to addressing the problem through national policies and international collaboration. Christopher Field, a Stanford University professor of environmental studies, said the solution would ultimately require a complete transformation to a carbon-free economy. The first mention of divestment came about 40 minutes into the discussion, from Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard history of science professor. “I think we’re at a point where we need disruptive politics,” Oreskes said. “I don’t see how we can have this conversation we’re having here and still be continuing to invest in companies that are building more fossil fuel infrastructure…that is locking us into the very grave problem [of climate change] that we claim to be very very worried about,” she said to a burst of applause from the audience. Oreskes’ statement led to a debate about the moral imperative to fight climate change, and the role of universities in making political and social decisions. For two years, student activists, along with some alumni and faculty, have pushed Harvard to divest its $36 billion endowment from fossil fuels. It’s part of a global divestment campaign against the oil and gas industry. Over the past few years, 28 universities and colleges have divested or pledged to divest, along with 41 cities, 72 religious institutions, 30 foundations and hundreds of individuals. Rebecca Henderson, a Harvard Business School professor, said she is “very uncomfortable with a blanket policy” on divestment. She said she believes Harvard should divest from coal, but wants to be more “targeted” about the rest of the fossil fuel industry. Harvard geology professor Daniel Schrag had similar reservations. “At a basic moral level, the students are right,” he said. “It’s wrong to use fossil fuels.” But Schrag said it makes more sense to go after coal first because it’s worse than oil and gas for both the climate and public health. Duke environmental professor Richard Newell worried that the focus on divestment would make the debate too polarized. “Unless we bring [the conversation] back to the middle, we will not progress,” he said. Joseph Aldy, a public policy professor at Harvard Kennedy School of Government, wants divestment activists to direct their energy toward politicians who deny climate change. He encouraged them to get political and “impose a cost” on policymakers who say “absolutely ridiculous things” about global warming science. The Other Side of Campus: Civil Disobedience As the panel drew to a close, a handful of Harvard students on the other side of Harvard Yard continued a planned week-long blockade of Massachusetts Hall, the historic building that houses the Office of the President. Meanwhile, nine Harvard alumni launched a parallel sit-in at the Harvard Alumni Association Office. They were prepared to face arrest to make their point. Ted Hamilton, a second-year Harvard law student who was part of the Massachusetts Hall blockade, said he was “pretty disappointed” by the presidential panel. It was a “conversation in a bubble,” he said, with lots of talk about solutions but “no imagination” about how to scale up the solutions to a global level. Jamie Henn, communications director for the grassroots environmental group 350.org, said it was good to see Oreskes “make a vocal case for divestment,” but the panel was essentially a “talk show” that distracted from the real issues. 350.org launched the divestment movement in",

    "date": "2015-04-17T09:00:14-04:00",
    "content": "Republican policymakers who maintain climate denialist views are increasingly at odds with the majority of their constituents, according to a new analysis by researchers at Yale University. The researchers compared votes by U.S. senators on a January climate change measure with their constituents’ posture based on a new model that extrapolates localized climate views from polling data. The vote was on an amendment to recognize that “(1) climate change is real; and (2) human activity significantly contributes to climate change.” Republican Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, for example, voted no on the amendment. Yet 58 percent of Coloradans accept the scientific evidence for anthropogenic warming. Similarly, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida—a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination—also voted no, though 56 percent of Floridians say climate change is real and man-made. So did Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada, where 57 percent would have voted yes. The politicians’ views lag U.S. public opinion, which already trails far behind the scientific community’s certainty on the reality of global warming. Various polls have found between 97 to 98 percent of working climate scientists accept the evidence for human-caused climate change. This gap in climate belief is a “major problem,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. These senators “are some of the key decision makers in American society, and their decisions affect all of us.” The Yale analysis quantifies a growing recognition among political and environmental experts that some lawmakers’ positions aren’t keeping up as the national climate conversation evolves. “Markets have been moving much faster than policymakers” on acknowledging and addressing climate change, Sarah Ladislaw, an expert on energy politics and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said during a panel discussion at the Future of Energy Summit Tuesday in New York. While partisan gridlock has stifled any significant global warming action in Congress, businesses have launched their own energy efficiency, sustainability and climate resilience programs. They are also investing millions of dollars in climate solutions. Americans have become increasingly concerned about climate change in recent years—with 63 percent of the public agreeing that global warming is happening, according to Yale data. They are also increasingly supporting climate action. Sixty-one percent of Americans think the federal government should force corporations to pay a price for carbon pollution, according to a poll released Wednesday by Stanford University and Resources for the Future, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. So far the disparity hasn’t carried political ramifications for legislators, but that may also be in flux, Leiserowitz said. “Climate change is not currently at the top of most voters’ minds when choosing who to vote for, but that’s starting to change,” he said. “There are numerous organizations now working to build public and political will for climate action, including making it a more important electoral issue.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "A $2 trillion group of investors will ask regulators on Friday to force oil and gas companies to provide more disclosures about climate-related risks to their businesses. The request, backed by 62 institutional investors from the U.S. and Europe, is included in an April 17 letter to Mary Jo White, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The comptrollers for New York State and New York City submitted a similar letter to the commission. The letters are the latest sign of the growing concern from shareholders and others about how fossil fuel companies would fare in a world that’s shifting to low-carbon energy sources. “We are concerned that oil and gas companies are not disclosing sufficient information about several converging factors that, together, will profoundly affect the economics of the industry,” the investors wrote. The group cited worries that carbon assets could become uneconomic—or stranded—if climate-related trends permanently undercut prices and demand for fossil fuels. Those fears are exacerbated by “excessive capital spending on high-cost, carbon intensive projects such as Arctic drilling, ultra deepwater drilling and Canadian oil sands projects,” the investors wrote. “We have found an absence of disclosure in SEC filings regarding these material risks,” said the investor group, which was organized by the sustainability group Ceres. On Thursday, shareholders of oil giant BP reinforced the importance of such disclosures by overwhelmingly approving a measure that requires the company to provide more robust yearly climate change-related information, including data about the viability of BP projects in a low-carbon economy. The disclosures are designed to allow investors “to judge whether BP is positioning itself to be a sustainable player in the energy system,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners, the Church of England. The church was part of a broad coalition backing the BP resolution. The BP measure was approved by more than 98 percent of the shares voted, surpassing the 75 percent benchmark for making the resolution binding under British law. Beginning next year, BP must disclose efforts to cut carbon emissions; whether company projects will be viable in a low-carbon economy; the company’s investment in low-carbon energy technology; executive incentives tied to the low-carbon transition; and BP’s lobbying on climate-related public policy. Shareholders have repeatedly requested similar information from ExxonMobil, Chevron and other U.S. oil and gas companies. Several of those requests are included in resolutions set for annual meeting votes next month. Under U.S. securities law, shareholder resolutions are not binding, and fossil fuel companies have routinely opposed and tried to disqualify all shareholder proposals. Last year, ExxonMobil agreed to produce a report on stranded asset risk in response to a shareholder resolution. In the report, the company dismissed the concern by noting that rising global demand for energy would protect its fossil fuel reserves from becoming stranded through",

    "date": "2015-04-13T16:02:55-04:00",
    "content": "While plenty of people found humor in the recent news that officials in Florida and Wisconsin are censoring state workers’ ability to talk about, much less work on, climate change, other states are not necessarily laughing. In fact, several political and environmental experts told InsideClimate News they could use it as a model to imitate. Florida Gov. Rick Scott became the leader of this potential trend last month when news emerged that he had ordered environmental staffers not to use the terms “climate change” or “global warming” in communications or reports. Wisconsin established a similar policy last week, voting to ban staffers who manage thousands of acres of forests from working on or talking about global warming. Experts now say that conservative lawmakers and public officials were far from embarrassed by the censorship revelations; they were emboldened by them. It could lead to a bevy of Republican lawmakers enacting similar policies in other states. “It seems like they are dusting off a playbook from the Bush administration years,” a period when federal officials removed or downplayed climate change research from government reports, said RL Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote, a super PAC that works to elect climate-conscious candidates. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other deep red states follow suit.” In states with substantial conservative bases, shutting down climate action through things like censorship has become a “risk-less position for a local Republican official to take,” said Walter Rosenbaum, an expert in environmental and energy policy at the University of Florida. If more leaders follow Wisconsin and Florida’s lead, it “will suffocate a lot of needed public discussion on the seriousness of this issue,” he said. While the number of Americans’ who accept human-driven climate change has gradually increased in recent years, the issue is still a politically polarizing one. The ideological divide is partly driven by conservatives’ mistrust of science and their belief that climate action requires Big Government policies. Republican lawmakers can often score big points in their districts if they hinder what has become labeled a liberal priority, experts said. While Wisconsin and Florida are the first states to outright ban their employees from working on climate change, at least publicly, Republican legislators have long tampered with how governments address global warming.

    "date": "2015-04-14T14:00:30-04:00",
    "content": "With more and more companies abandoning the American Legislative Exchange Council over its refusal to act on climate change, the prominent conservative organization finds itself in a bind: eager to stanch the exodus of high-profile members, yet at risk of alienating the powerful fossil fuel interests that make up its core membership. “What they’re wanting to do is speak out of both sides of their mouth,” said Nick Surgey, research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal watchdog group that focuses on corporate influence on public policy. The departure of Google last fall over ALEC’s position on global warming prompted the group to publicly refute allegations that it denies climate change. “ALEC recognizes that climate change is an important issue,” and “no ALEC model policy denies climate change,” it said. This month ALEC sent cease-and-desist letters to two progressive advocacy organizations demanding they retract statements that ALEC denies global warming. But as recently as December, an ALEC summit brought together state legislators to develop a model bill for their home states that would dismantle federal environmental and carbon policy, and featured a speaker who said, “Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It is a benefit. It is the very elixir of life.” “Basically [ALEC is] saying, ‘We’ve turned a new leaf and it’s a new day and we’re not living in the past,’ said Kert Davies, executive director of the Climate Investigations Center, a Virginia-based watchdog group. “Yet there’s not been one model bill they’ve generated that is a solution to climate change. All of them are to block current pathways—from renewables to EPA regulation. Their whole slate of work is actively anti-climate.” ALEC did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment. For 40 years, ALEC has convened conservative state legislators and corporations to pare back state-level regulation and try to block federal rules through model legislation, as part of its ideological commitment to small government and unfettered markets. The group is overwhelmingly Republican. With more than two-thirds of state legislative chambers in GOP hands, ALEC’s opportunity to shape state-level policy is enormous. Most of its funding comes from conservative philanthropy and corporate members. Some of its most influential members are powerful fossil fuel interests known for blocking climate action. ALEC’s environmental agenda has included efforts to halt government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, block renewable energy and teach children that the science is too uncertain to conclude man-made climate change is happening. Google left the group in September, followed by Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, Yelp, Rupert Murdoch’s Newscorp, oil and gas company Occidental Petroleum and most recently BP America. Inside the Summit By the time the December summit in Washington D.C. rolled around, the rift between ALEC’s members over climate policy was in full force. Members worked to craft a model bill there that called for abolishing the Environmental Protection Agency and replacing it with a council of state representatives. But they decided eventually to table the discussion after a representative from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said such a move would make the group appear extreme, according to an ALEC member who was present at the discussion and asked not to be identifed for fear his membership would be revoked. Pfizer later sent a statement to the research group PR Watch, a project of the Center for Media and Democracy, and said of its ALEC membership: “Our funding of ALEC is specifically for work on health policy issues, including innovation, patients’ access to medicines, and IP (intellectual property) protection. We disagree with ALEC’s position on climate change.” The December conference also featured Craig Idso, founder of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change. The Arizona-based group claims rising carbon dioxide levels will benefit the planet by increasing crop yields—an argument discredited years ago by scientists. “Instead of being shunned like the plague, the ongoing rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide should be welcomed with opened arms,” Idso told an audience of about a hundred legislators and corporate executives, according to the ALEC member who spoke to InsideClimate News. “Far from being a pollutant, [CO2] is better than being the best fertilizer ever invented because it is actually…food that sustains essentially all plants on a daily basis.” Carbon-reduction policies and actions “are unnecessary, unwise, and unwarranted,” Idso said. Similarly, a summit last August that ALEC hosted featured speakers Joseph Bast of the right-wing Heartland Institute and Marc Morano, head of Climate Depot, a climate denial website. Bast’s presentation included points denying the risks of climate change such as, “Global warming is not a crisis…There is no need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.” He also called for the dismantling of the EPA. Morano said that “polar bears were doing fine,” sea level rise was decelerating, and “on virtually every claim—from A to Z—the claims of the promoters of manmade climate fears are falling short.” No climatologist representing mainstream science has made a presentation to ALEC members. ‘An Untenable Position’ The biggest fossil fuel companies in ALEC’s ranks include the Southern Company, the coal giant Peabody Energy, Koch Industries and ExxonMobil. The conferences it holds several time a year are essential to ALEC’s work, providing a forum where corporate representatives who pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the group get face-to-face access to state legislators. There, they craft model bills together on issues such as environmental protection that generally advance the interests of major industries. The expert presentations at conferences are meant to motivate and inform the legislators’ work on the model bills, according to the ALEC member who wished not to be identified. Outside its conference rooms, ALEC has been scrambling to rework its public image as supportive of climate denial. Google chairman Eric Schmidt sparked the tussle when he said that on climate, ALEC is “just literally lying.” None of the other companies that left specifically mentioned climate change, with the exception of the software giant SAP America, ALEC’s corporate board chair, whose German parent company told a local magazine in November that it was departing because of the group’s “strange policies” on climate, guns and voter rights. ALEC’s new CEO, Lisa Nelson, has reiterated in recent months that the group doesn’t deny climate change. However, when she was asked by National Journal if she ascribed climate change to human activity, she said she didn’t know. “It’s an agnostic position, which is quite different from the old atheistic position on climate change, of ‘I don’t believe it’s real,'” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina and executive director of RepublicEn.org, which seeks to mobilize conservatives to address climate change. “But that is ultimately an untenable position. I’m not a doctor. So, does that mean I don’t have a position on healthcare?” Surgey of the Center for Media and Democracy said “the next test of whether they’ve actually changed is their San Diego meeting in July.” That meeting will likely be far smaller than previous ones.

    "content": "Scientists studying the effects of Arctic melting have found themselves in what you could call the Polar Bear Wars. On one side, a sizeable group of researchers have spent decades documenting the connection between the rapid melting of sea ice and declines in polar bear health and survival. On the other, a handful of scientists who have observed polar bears eating nontraditional prey on land—like goose eggs and berries—have hypothesized that could mitigate the loss of their icy habitat as the globe warms. Studies from this side have spawned misleading headlines such as, “Polar Bears Just Might Outlive Us All.” A paper published today in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment is the latest attempt to settle the score. The review article, “Can Polar Bears Use Terrestrial Foods to Offset Lost Ice-Based Hunting Opportunities,” concludes that even though some polar bears are eating on land, those instances are limited and the nutritional benefits of that food is in doubt. “The intent was to clarify what we know now,” said the paper’s lead author Karyn Rode, an Alaska-based Research Wildlife Biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Rode said the research showed that eating on land may be helping a few bears, there is no evidence it is benefitting them on a population level. Polar bears have evolved to survive on the sea ice, thriving on fat of the prey they hunt there, mostly ringed seals. Since the beginning of the satellite record in",

    "content": "Government officials last week blocked a groundbreaking shareholder proposal on climate change from going to a vote at ExxonMobil. The move has confounded proponents, because the decision came just five days after the same agency cleared a similar resolution for Chevron’s shareholder ballot. “I’m completely baffled, frankly,” said Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at wealth manager Arjuna Capital, lead sponsor of the ExxonMobil resolution. “The proposals are virtually identical.” The Chevron and Exxon rulings came from two different attorney-advisers at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency provides guidance to public companies that seek to exclude shareholder resolutions from the annual ballots distributed each year to vote on board directors, among other things. The two oil company proposals are part of a big wave of shareholder resolutions this year that address sustainability issues, climate change and the environment. Both of the resolutions at issue cite the threat from climate change as a reason to rein in spending on risky exploration projects in ultra-deep water, the Arctic and Canada’s oil sands. They argue that those projects at Exxon and Chevron are chasing reserves that might become unsellable—or stranded—in a carbon-constrained world and in low-oil-price scenarios. The resolutions say the prudent course is for the companies to return that cash to shareholders instead, via dividends (Chevron) or a combination of dividends and share buybacks (Exxon). The scenario spelled out in the proposals is not far-fetched. Reports from the International Energy Agency and others conclude that a large share of already found reserves of coal, oil and natural gas must be left in the ground to prevent catastrophic effects from climate change. The World Bank, United Nations, Bank of England and others have acknowledged the possibility that tackling climate change could leave fossil fuel companies with unburnable reserves. ExxonMobil, Chevron and other oil companies have largely dismissed the concerns, concluding that rising global demand for energy can’t be met without steady growth in fossil fuel supplies.

    "date": "2015-03-12T16:17:03-04:00",
    "content": "Officials from five states weighed in Wednesday at a Senate hearing on the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Their characterizations of the plan ran the gamut from “misguided” and “problematic” to “workable and practical.” The perspectives threw into sharp relief the vastly different viewpoints of states on the Clean Power Plan, which is a part of the Obama administration’s broader strategy to head off climate change. The arguments ran mainly along party lines. New York and California, strongholds of Democratic power, supported the proposal, while the other three states lambasted the EPA for forcing them to comply with a plan they see as unfeasible and unnecessary. Representatives from Wisconsin, Indiana and Wyoming questioned the EPA’s legal authority to mandate carbon cuts under the Clean Air Act. The states also questioned the reliability and affordability of power under the new proposal; and they challenged the urgency to act on climate change. Officials from New York and California, by contrast, pointed to successes in reducing carbon emissions without hurting their states’ economies. That’s a sign that climate action and economic well-being are not antithetical, they said. The hearing is the second this year on the Clean Power Plan before the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee. The witnesses included heads of state environmental agencies, a public utility commissioner and a representative from a state attorney general’s office. These officials are responsible for proposing and executing a cost-effective plan to cut carbon emissions in their states. The states represented at the hearing have very dissimilar energy portfolios, ranging from an intense reliance on coal to a mixed bag of renewables and fossil fuels. Wyoming is most dependent on coal for power, with about 90 percent of its electricity produced by burning coal. The state is also the leading coal producer, accounting for almost 40 percent of the coal mined in the country. In addition, many neighboring states draw power from Wyoming; nearly two-thirds of the power produced in the state is used outside its borders. The director of Wyoming’s Department of Environmental Quality, Todd Parfitt, testified that “the proposed rule [is] problematic and unrealistic to achieve” in his state. The proposal doesn’t credit the state for the renewable energy it produces and yet expects it to bear the costs for producing power used by neighboring states, he said. “There’s a big contrast between leading states and states that are dragging their feet that would do well by looking to the leading states,” said Travis Madsen, senior program manager for global warming solutions at Environment America. “Wyoming is blessed with a lot of renewable energy resources [and it] could do much much more.” The hearing also revealed a fundamental problem facing the EPA as it tries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in different sectors—many state and federal leaders deny the science on climate change. Sen. Jeffrey Merkley (D-Ore.), asked witnesses if the states contributing to climate change should be held liable by the states facing some of its worst effects. The commissioner of Indiana’s Department of Environmental Management, Thomas Easterly, replied, “The environment of our earth has been changing for all of recorded history. Indiana used to be under an ice sheet. There are natural variations.” In his opening remarks, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who is the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has long challenged the science on humans’ contribution to climate change, slammed the EPA for imposing regulations on states. In support of his argument, he pointed to a map of the U.S. with 32 states shaded green. These 32 states oppose the Clean Power Plan, he said, and yet the EPA is forging ahead. Less than half the 32 states that Inhofe referred to are actively opposing the EPA’s plan. Only 12 states—including Wisconsin and Wyoming—have sued the EPA, challenging its legal authority to impose carbon regulation. A handful of other states have set up legislative roadblocks to submitting a plan. In a number of states, however, leaders have voiced their disapproval of the plan, but are yet to announce their intent to defy or challenge federal regulations. In a joint letter to President Obama last year, the governors of Wisconsin, Wyoming and 13 other states said the EPA “overstepped this hypothetical authority when it acted to coerce states to adopt compliance measures.” Officials from New York and California applauded the EPA’s efforts from the outset to tackle climate change and urged other states to address carbon pollution. “I have good news for other states,” said Michael Myers, section chief in the Environmental Protection Bureau of the New York Attorney General’s Office, at the hearing. “You can significantly reduce these emissions from the power sector and do so in a way that grows your economy.” New York is one of nine northeastern states belonging to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a regulatory program that has set up a cap-and-invest system for carbon emissions from the power sector. According to their own estimates, RGGI states have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from",

    "date": "2015-03-10T11:00:06-04:00",
    "content": "It’s been so bitter cold in New England this winter that it didn’t surprise Dr. Mark R. Windt when one of his patients came in wheezing and complaining of shortness of breath. The cold air had aggravated her asthma. The daytime high temperatures sometimes weren’t getting out of single digits. “That is cold, COLD,” said Windt, a specialist in allergies, immunology and pulmonology in North Hampton, N.H. Scientists have attributed the frigid temperatures and historic snowfalls to storm tracks that have become stronger and more frequent because of increased greenhouse gas emissions that alter atmospheric conditions. “There’s no doubt climate change had an effect on my patient’s asthma and is having an effect on the health of others,” Windt said. Windt and a majority of his colleagues in the American Thoracic Society who specialize in the treatment of respiratory illnesses are connecting some of their patients’ disorders to climate change. A recent survey by the society found that the majority of its members believe climate change is having a negative impact on the health of their patients. The survey was published in the February issue of the Annals of the American Thoracic Society. The survey, which was conducted by the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, polled 5,500 U.S. ATS members and asked a series of questions about climate change and its effect on patients. Nearly two-thirds of those responding to the survey reported that they have already observed symptoms among their patients they attribute to climate change. The doctors, registered nurses and respiratory therapists who answered questions said they were seeing worsening of asthma associated with exposure to ozone or other pollutants, longer and more severe allergy seasons, and more cases of acute and chronic lung conditions. The survey also showed the doctors are worried that four distinct groups will be disproportionately affected by climate change disorders: people with chronic diseases; the poor; children under 4; and adults over 60. One of the authors of the study, Gary Ewart, senior director of ATS government relations, said the survey results will not only help medical professionals become better prepared to treat patients with climate-change-related illnesses but will bring additional attention to the need to address climate change. Nearly 75 percent of survey respondents said they thought physicians should play a role in informing the public about climate change. Ewart said the results also indicate a need for physicians and scientists to further prod national and international policymakers to address emissions of greenhouse gases. A discussion on the mitigation of climate change also stirs talk about climate change as a public health issue, he said. “Climate change must be taken seriously from a public policy standpoint and a public health standpoint,” Ewart said. “One of the things this survey does is shows the importance of healthcare groups taking a stand on climate change, and educating their members and patients that climate change is a healthcare issue.” High temperatures can lead to elevated ozone levels that have been associated with the exacerbation of respiratory disease, including respiratory infections in children, and a worsening of asthma in children and adults. Changing temperatures and rising carbon dioxide levels are lengthening the pollen season and increasing the production and allergic potency of pollen, the ATS points out in an analysis of the survey results. That may explain a recent increase in the frequency of allergic disease, according to the study. Climate change also promotes the spread of insect-borne infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, according to the study. It contributes to the destruction of housing and public health infrastructure through storms and floods that result in injuries and unsanitary conditions. Back in New Hampshire, Windt prescribed medication for his patient’s asthma and recommended that she wear a mask to lessen the harshness of the cold air entering her lungs. As a doctor confronting climate change illnesses, Windt doesn’t simply treat his patients’ physical symptoms; he takes time to explain the connection of their sickness to wide-scale changes in Earth’s climate system. “It’s really in the trenches where we need to talk about climate change,” Windt said. “It’s not some esoteric professorial discussion. People need to know how it affects them.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

    "date": "2015-02-02T13:00:36-05:00",
    "content": "National Forest Service scientists recently completed a study that suggests forests in 11 southern states might be losing some of their ability to absorb carbon. Photo courtesy of National Forest Service. When U.S. Forest Service scientist David Wear hikes the trails crisscrossing the Appalachian Mountains, he pauses to revel not only in the beauty and solitude, but to consider the remarkable role that the forest around him plays in the world’s environment. “A walk in the woods is as much recreation as intellectual stimulation for me,” Wear said. “I see questions about what’s happening in the changing dynamics of the forests.” One of those questions: How are today’s forests doing when it comes to sucking carbon out of the atmosphere? Wear and two Forest Service colleagues, John Coulston and Jim Vose, recently completed a study examining the carbon accumulation levels of forests in the southern United States. They discovered a possible reduction in the ability of these forests to absorb carbon. That worries Wear and his colleagues because carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas that causes climate change. The trio of scientists, who worked out of the Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, recently had their findings published in the journal Scientific Reports. The study examined the impacts on forests from such things as fire, disease and cutting, as well as the effects of changing land uses. Data were collected from 40,000 locations from Virginia to Louisiana. Forests are among nature’s most efficient and reliable systems for sucking up and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees use the carbon dioxide in photosynthesis—the process that allows all plants to live and grow. The scientists said forests in the southeastern U.S. provided a good workshop because they have more forest land than 96 percent of the countries in the world. Further, the forests in the 11 states studied absorb an estimated 15 percent of the carbon emission generated by energy- and transportation sources in the United States. “This is clearly about climate change mitigation,” Wear said. “We are concerned about sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.” The question, Coulston said, is what happens if the capacity to absorb carbon becomes less efficient or less resilient. “Greenhouse emissions go up,” he said. The study shows that future carbon accumulation rates in the forests are sensitive to land-use changes. Choices for land use that either reduce the rate of reforestation or increase the rate of deforestation are key factors in future forest carbon accumulation, according to the study. “The potential for future carbon accumulation in forests is uncertain due in part to the combined effects of changes in forest growth rates, land use choices, forest management,” and a number of other factors, including the direct and indirect effects of climate change, according to the report. And it’s not that there’s less forest in the study area. There’s actually a little more because the amount of agricultural land being returned to forest has slightly offset the amount of forest lost to urban development, Coulston said. The biggest factor is the age of the forests. They are getting old. And old trees don’t have the same capacity to absorb carbon as younger trees because they are not growing as fast. The scientists say they hope the study will help policymakers understanding what’s happening in the forests of the South so that information can be considered when addressing climate change. “It allows for planning and strategizing to include carbon absorption by forests so that it can be factored into policy goals for emissions,” Coulston said. “When considering emission-reduction targets, you need to know what’s emitting and what’s absorbing. Forests are a large factor.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

Due to climate change, more of the most extreme precipitation events, such as this recent snowfall, are expected to slam the area in the coming decades. Nuclear power critics cite the Pilgrim shutdown as proof the industry isn’t ready now—and won’t be any time soon. Federal regulators counter that several initiatives to improve nuclear plant responses to extreme weather and other natural hazards are already under way. The region’s first major nor’easter this winter, dubbed “Juno” by The Weather Channel, dumped up to 3 feet of snow in some places. Parts of the Massachusetts coast were wracked by hurricane-force gusts (up to 78 miles per hour). The culmination of high tide and storm-related winds produced a 2-5-foot storm surge that contributed to coastal flooding. Although several nuclear power plants stood in Juno’s path, only Pilgrim and New Hampshire’s Seabrook station faced the full intensity of the storm. Seabrook was unscathed by the event and remained at full capacity throughout. At Entergy Corporation’s Pilgrim facility, however, staff moved to decrease the plant’s operating capacity to 20 percent because of stormy conditions. During this process, according to a company statement, “the distribution lines that Pilgrim uses to send electricity to the grid became inoperable due to an offsite issue,” the cause of which is still unknown. Following emergency procedures, the plant automatically shut down early Tuesday morning. Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, wrote to InsideClimate News in an email: “Pilgrim is in a safe, stable condition. All safety systems responded as designed. There was no danger to the public or the environment from the shutdown.” The plant’s staff is working to restore power, but there’s no estimate for when the station, which creates enough power for 550,000 homes, will come back online and reconnect with the grid. NSTAR, the main utility serving the area, told InsideClimate News no homes lost power due this incident. This means the grid was able to find other sources to compensate for the lost electricity from the nuclear plant. An on-site emergency diesel generator is now temporarily powering the plant for its safety operations. If the past is any indication, delays could continue for up to a week. That’s what happened in February",

    "content": "While President Barack Obama wants to protect young people from the catastrophic effects of global warming, school boards and lawmakers in some states are fighting to prevent students from learning the science of climate change. In the most recent skirmish, parents and science educators in West Virginia blocked an attempt to weaken the teaching of climate change in elementary and secondary school classrooms. Responding to petitions and protests, the state Board of Education voted Jan. 14 to undo revisions to teaching guidelines that would have cast doubt on global warming and the reasons for it. The West Virginia case is part of a long-running battle over the first set of national guidelines for science education to require that students be taught that climate change is a scientific fact and mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The guidelines, known as the Next Generation Science Standards, were developed by science-education groups and state school systems, led by the National Research Council. They have been adopted by 13 states and the District of Columbia, but face resistance in several states from climate skeptics on school boards and in legislatures. “Climate is the major sticking point in the standards,” said Lisa Hoyos, director and co-founder of the national activist group Climate Parents. “Even if a state has been involved in writing, they go home and the politics win out,” she said. “Kids are caught in the crossfire.” The standards matter because science guidelines for kindergarten through 12th grade haven’t been revised since",

In the first executive order after his State of the Union address, the White House created the Arctic Executive Steering Committee, which will attempt to wrangle the numerous agencies in charge of Arctic programs and better coordinate their work in the face of climate change. “Over the past 60 years, climate change has caused the Alaskan Arctic to warm twice as rapidly as the rest of the United States,” Obama said in the order, “and will continue to transform the Arctic as its consequences grow more severe.” The order included the United States’ responsibility to “mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change” and to be ruled by “science-based decision making.” It comes in the lead-up to the United States’ taking over leadership of the Arctic Council, a voluntary intergovernmental forum consisting of the Arctic states and a number of observer nations that addresses environmental and economic development issues in the Arctic. In April, the U.S. will take the helm from Canada, which has led the council for the last two years. There is currently a sprawling network of agencies and departments that deal with Arctic-related issues, not to mention the state, local and Alaska Native tribal governments, which the new steering committee will also include. “As the Arctic has changed, the number of Federal working groups created to address the growing strategic importance and accessibility of this critical region has increased,” the executive order says.

Starting in April, the United States will take over leadership of the Arctic Council, the intergovernmental body charged with coordinating the eight Arctic states: Canada; Denmark, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands; Finland; Iceland; Norway; Russia; Sweden and the United States—along with a number of observer nations, including China, India, Japan and South Korea. Though the council can’t issue policy, it provides the main forum for consensus building in the region, and produces recommendations that the delegates can bring back to their home countries. Though the United States’ tenure is still months away, the incoming head of the council—retired Coast Guard Adm. Robert J. Papp, Jr.—has already indicated in a number of speeches that a drastic shift is coming, and that climate change will be on the council’s front burner. Papp, who spent 39 years in the Coast Guard, is Secretary of State John Kerry’s pick to represent the country as the special representative to the council. He has said that part of his job will be introducing the U.S. to the Arctic—where it has remained largely absent in policy-making—and introducing the Arctic to the U.S., where there has been a lack of awareness in both public and political spheres. The U.S. takes the reins from Canada, which has led the council for the past two years. The theme during Canada’s leadership was “Development for the people of the North,” and during that tenure the council shifted its emphasis from environmental protection to development of the Arctic.

    "date": "2014-12-19T20:11:18-05:00",
    "content": "North Dakota regulators recently announced plans to bump up the state’s allowable oil-and-gas radioactive waste disposal limit by tenfold. The current threshold is one of the strictest in the country, at 5 picocuries per gram. That’s roughly the equivalent of the natural radiation levels found in North Dakota soil. Consequently, many companies truck their waste out of state to places with higher limits, including the neighboring Minnesota and Montana. But the new limit of 50 picocuries per gram, proposed by the state’s Department of Health last week, on Dec. 12, would change all that. Although it’s far from the loosest limit around, it would be one of the highest in the Great Plains region. Both the state’s energy and waste industries welcome this rulemaking, which would save oil and gas companies significant transport costs and bring in new waste-disposal business to local landfills. But landowners who live near the disposal sites in rural western North Dakota don’t want their home to transform into a regional dumping ground and are wary of the waste’s threat to public health. The new limit is based on “the absolutely best science available,” said Scott Radig, who heads up the division of waste management at the state’s Department of Health. Regulators commissioned research institution Argonne National Laboratory last fall to study the issue. The group’s report, published in November, said raising the state’s threshold up to the 50 picocuries per gram limit could still be protective of human health and welfare. That’s as long as other conditions are met, such as allowing industrial or oilfield waste landfills to receive as much as 25,000 tons of this waste annually and requiring that the waste is buried a minimum of 10 feet below the top of the landfill. North Dakota regulators did include these criteria in the draft rules. This rulemaking comes at a time of increasing tensions between communities and regulators over how to manage North Dakota’s booming energy industry and its growing waste footprint. In nearly a decade, North Dakota shot up from the No. 9 state for crude oil production to the No. 2 spot. And since",

But 11 months into his term, there are signs that a shift is under way as the mayor made significant pledges and restructured the city’s climate team. Last week, de Blasio quietly named Nilda Mesa to lead New York’s climate agenda as director of a new Office of Sustainability. The agency combines two offices with climate-action responsibility. Mesa, an environmental policy and planning authority, has experience at the federal level working for the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency and in New York as the former head of Columbia University’s sustainability efforts. “She has sterling environmental credentials and the ear of the mayor and his top officials—two extremely valuable assets for success in this position,” said Eric Goldstein, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s New York City Environment program. “There had been a gap in critical personnel. We’re glad it has been filled by a quality candidate.” Green groups had been calling on the mayor for months to expand his global warming agenda, particularly by naming a sustainability head.

    "content": "This was the year Big Oil and its fossil-fuel brethren began to look a lot less invincible. An unexpected crash in crude prices forced industry leaders to cut spending, mothball expensive projects and put the brakes on new drilling. Local officials, residents and environmentalists blocked new pipelines and rebelled against the surge in shipping oil by railcar. And new limits on power plant pollution, methane releases and oilfield gas burn-off are still looming over coal, natural gas and oil operations across the country. More threatening than all of those things, however, is something the industry has never faced before: The growing belief among global leaders, investors, scientists, and large corporations that the use of fossil fuels must be sharply curtailed—if not phased out—for the sake of future generations. Statements from the International Energy Agency, World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki-moon have all reinforced the notion that most of the fossil fuel reserves already claimed by companies must stay in the ground—stranded—if the world is to avoid climate change that’s catastrophic for coastal regions, food production, water supplies and more. The latest acknowledgement of the conflict between fossil fuel company interests and the necessity of climate action came from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who recently told Parliament that the bank is reviewing the potential risks for investors of “unburnable carbon.” These high-level endorsements have helped drive the fossil fuel divestment movement, making it the most visible manifestation of the strange new world for oil, natural gas and coal companies. Some within the industry began to fight back against the divestment push, which has grown quickly, spread overseas, and forced large shareholders to reconsider their stock holdings in fossil fuel companies. Led by college students, faith-based groups, philanthropic organizations and others, divestment advocates view climate change as a threat to mankind, and especially to poorer and island nations. Tackling the threat is a moral imperative, the activists say, and that means university endowments, charities and others must stop owning shares in the fossil fuel companies who worsen climate change and undermine efforts to limit the damage. Here’s a look at the four biggest ways the divestment movement made its mark in",

    "content": "As the first delegates landed in Peru this week for the latest United Nations climate talks, activists were already taking to the streets of Lima to demand that world leaders take aggressive action against global warming. Hundreds of climate activists and faith leaders gathered in Lima Sunday night for a candlelight vigil. Joining them were Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and Manuel Pulgar Vidal, Peru’s environment minister and president of the Lima negotiations. That same day, Greenpeace activists projected a pro-solar energy message on Machu Picchu, Peru’s ancient, iconic cultural site. On Monday, dozens of others massed for a demonstration of the Fast for the Climate movement, in which people refuse to eat as a show of solidarity for people feeling the effects of climate change. Those events were just the beginning of what promised to be a busy two weeks for climate activists. Representatives of 190 countries are in Peru to draft the basics of a global climate accord to be finalized in Paris next December. This week delegates are discussing how much nations should reduce greenhouse gas emissions and how much developed nations should pay to help developing countries—most of which did little to contribute to the problem—adapt to climate change. For climate activists, the talks this month are an important opportunity to show world leaders the size, strength and diversity of their movement, as well as to bolster its Latin American base. Wherever climate talks take place, there’s a “giant swelling of awareness in that community that lasts well after the conference ends,” said Nigel Crawhall, director of secretariat for the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee, a network of indigenous groups. “In Latin America, there haven’t really been any mass mobilizations on climate,” said Iain Keith, campaign director for Avaaz, an online network that helps organize “people-powered politics” on dozens of issues worldwide. “We’re hoping that all the events in Peru over the next few weeks will have the same impact on the movement in South and Central America that the New York City march did for the United States’ climate movement.” New York Momentum Environment, social justice, youth, indigenous and religious groups have a slew of protests, marches, art installations, and other events planned to coincide with the Lima climate talks. While the activism probably won’t compare in size or scope to what took place in September when hundreds of thousands of people marched through New York demanding action on global warming, it is nonetheless a significant step for the climate movement, several climate and environmental leaders told InsideClimate News.

    "date": "2014-11-26T11:00:04-05:00",
    "content": "Last week, Minnesota regulators quietly issued a major fine of $85,000 against frac sand operator Tiller Corp. for a long list of violations, including emitting unsafe levels of toxic dust. That’s the largest penalty levied against a frac sand company in the state in at least three years. And it’s the second largest fine issued to any industry by regulators at the state’s Pollution Control Agency this year. The fine comes at a time when Minnesota is overhauling its rules for the burgeoning frac sand industry. Minnesota is the nation’s fourth largest producer of silica sand, a key ingredient used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Its neighbor Wisconsin is the top producer. The frac sand industry is driving an economic boom across the region, providing thousands of new jobs and injecting millions of dollars in new development. But there’s concern about the growing frac sand industry’s impact on air, water, noise and light pollution. Minnesota officials are trying to address many of these issues with the current rulemaking effort. Tiller Corp. operates in Minnesota and Wisconsin—and has received big fines in both states. The company mines the sand in Wisconsin and then carts it to Minnesota, where it’s cleaned and sorted. Then the precious material is shipped out by rail or truck, generally to well sites across the country. Silica sand is hard and round, making it ideal for breaking open shale bedrock when injected underground with water and chemicals. It then helps hold open the fresh cracks while oil and gas are extracted. A single fracked well can use up to 10,000 tons of this special sand over its lifetime. The Tiller facility hit with the recent fine is a combined processing and transport hub in North Branch, a town close to the Wisconsin border. Tiller Corp. did not respond to requests for comment. According to the Pollution Control Agency, the company failed to submit equipment test results 45 times, exceeded air permit emission limits 25 times and exceeded noise limits four times in",

    "date": "2014-11-10T11:00:54-05:00",
    "content": "Californians’ overwhelming approval for a bond that authorized $7.5 billion for badly needed water projects was largely driven by the state’s current drought and by fears that unpredictable weather patterns fostered by global warming will continue to strain the water system. California is in a severe, multiyear drought that continues to deplete its reservoirs and groundwater aquifers. Polls going into last week’s election showed that more than three-quarters of Californians believe drought and water shortages are among the state’s most pressing issues. Two-thirds of voters said yes to the bond last week. The bond funds a strategic blueprint where funding priorities are tied to a comprehensive statewide water action plan that accounts for future drought and other variables associated with climate change, said Timothy Quinn, executive director of the statewide Association of California Water Agencies. “At its core, Proposition 1 advances an all-of-the-above strategy that includes everything from local resources to water storage to safe drinking water,” he said. “Other states facing similar challenges may learn from that approach.” Quinn said the uniqueness of Prop. 1 is that it doesn’t just throw money at the immediate problem. In addition to financing two new dams and water treatment and seawater desalination projects, it will pay for groundwater cleanup and management and watershed restoration. Also on the list are water recycling, conservation and storm water capture projects. These kinds of projects are already woven into California’s public policy and will help move the state to a more sustainable water strategy, so it won’t be forced to build several complex and hugely expensive projects that would have transferred water from one region to another, said Doug Obegi, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council water program. It’s not so much the building of dams or the construction of reservoirs that should become a model, Obegi said, but the polices that address drought and climate change. “Along with the physical aspects that will be funded, it’s the discussion of conservation and climate adaptation and funding of those programs that will address a more secure water future that are distinctive,” he said. Michael Nelson, a professor of environmental ethics and philosophy at Oregon State University, said the conservation provisions in Prop. 1 should have been implemented years ago, before the water crisis became so severe. Voters throughout the nation need to understand, he said, that dealing with climate change is a moral problem, not just a technological, economic, or survival problem. “Without such a recognition, I think we’ll merely be responding to emergency after emergency with more technological fixes, never addressing the core issue, which is our bad relationship with nature,” said Nelson, who closely follows the national climate debate. “In fact, technologized fixes can make matters worse, in the sense that they can create greater harms down the road, but also in the sense that they can lull us into a false sense of security and therefore encourage us to not confront the real source of our problems.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "The public got a rare glimpse into the covert and hardball strategies used by some oil and gas companies when a lobbyist’s candid remarks were leaked to the New York Times and Bloomberg News last week. The leak made the lobbyist the victim of his own tactics. The man was Richard Berman, president of the consulting firm Berman and Company, who pitched a roomful of energy executives in June to invest $2 to $3 million in an “offensive” campaign in Colorado called Big Green Radicals that seeks to discredit anti-fracking advocates. “There is no sympathy for the oil and gas industry” and people don’t like the word “fracking,” Berman told his audience at the annual meeting of the Western Energy Alliance. So industry must go on the “offense” against environmental groups, destroy their credibility by airing the personal histories of “every single activist,” diminish their moral authority and use humor to “minimize or marginalize” them. The initial targets of the campaign were the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Food and Water Watch. Berman said the influx of money would be a “game-changer” and promised “total anonymity” to anyone who contributed. Donations would be processed through nonprofit organizations that aren’t required to disclose donors. Representatives from dozens of energy and oilfield service companies were present at the meeting, including Chesapeake, EnCana, Halliburton and BP America. Berman said “a few companies in the room” had already",

    "date": "2014-11-05T15:00:09-05:00",
    "content": "Environmental groups watched in shock last night as many of the seats they considered shoo-ins fell to GOP control—leaving the movement examining its big-money midterm strategy and how to push climate action forward with a Republican Congress. The nation’s major green groups spent about $85 million trying to make climate change a central focus of the election and elect pro-action candidates. They knew going in they faced an uphill battle. The sixth year of an administration is historically difficult for the ruling party to win, and many of the races were being contested in red, energy-producing states. But in the final weeks and days leading to Election Day, political forecasters projected positive outcomes for many of the races in which environmentalists spent time and money. “I felt disappointment, straight up,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, told InsideClimate News about watching the results come in. “It was hard to swallow seeing a lot of our friends and strong climate champions lose their races. And there were results that took us by surprise.” The unexpected losses included incumbent Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who lost their reelection bids 45-49 percent and 47-49 percent, respectively. Sen. Mark Begich’s loss in Alaska came as a surprise as well. In the Florida gubernatorial race, Democrat Charlie Crist was defeated for his old governor’s seat 47-48 percent by GOP incumbent Rick Scott. Groups including the Sierra Club, NRDC Action Fund, Environmental Defense Action Fund and the League of Conservation Voters—in addition to billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer—poured tens of millions of dollars into advertising and field operations in races across the country to combat the efforts of billionaire oil brothers Charles and David Koch. The groups knew they wouldn’t be able to go dollar-for-dollar against the Kochs, who spent at least $100 million this cycle (not including dark money donations that remain anonymous). But they hoped it would help neutralize some of the brothers’ impact. And they believe it did—just not enough. The groups did get two big Senate wins last night. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Democratic Gary Peters, previously a Representative for Michigan’s 14th congressional district, both defeated their opponents. In addition, the League of Conservation Voters announced last night that seven of its “Dirty Dozen” candidates lost their elections. “We always knew this was going to be a difficult cycle in the Senate,” said Jeff Gohringer, spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters. “We were almost exclusively playing defense in red and purple states and our work helped keep these races close up until Election Day.” The question is whether some or even much of that money should have been spent elsewhere. Such a big-money strategy is reminiscent of the movement’s inside-the-beltway tactics used in",

    "content": "As oil prices sagged again on Monday to a four-year low, the Carbon Tracker Initiative said the recent downward spiral “changes the whole dynamic” for Canada’s tar sands production. The “vast majority” of potential capital expenditures on tar sands projects that are still in the earliest phases of development would require such high oil prices that they are “particularly risky,” the group said. Hundreds of billions of dollars could be spent on projects that are underway or in development, Carbon Tracker said. At least two-thirds of the tar sands enterprise is at risk if current prices persist, or if they drop even lower. “We believe shareholders should be concerned at this potential level of expenditure and should consider whether it is prudent to risk such large amounts of capital on high cost projects that need high oil prices to be commercial,” the report said. Some 92 percent of this prospective tar sands production would need a price of at least $95 per barrel to make sense, given the risks. And “virtually all” of it needs at least $75 per barrel. These calculations include a $15 margin of safety above the estimated break-even cost of production, since it would not be prudent to invest in a project that would only break even. The report was based on prices for Brent crude, which are slightly higher than the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate price. (Tar sand crude, in turn, trades at a discount to WTI.) In trading on Tuesday, WTI touched $75 briefly and closed at $77. The report: <a href=”http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/",

Fred Upton, a 14-term incumbent, is unexpectedly vulnerable against his Democrat challenger, Paul Clements, a political rookie and professor of political science, who is an advocate of climate change action. Credit: House GOP via Flickr The race in Michigan’s 6th congressional district between incumbent Republican Congressman Fred Upton and Democrat Paul Clements has become surprisingly close—with Clements trailing the chairman of the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce by just a few points. But until a few days ago, almost no one outside of the district was watching or involved in the race. “It is now possible, if not likely, that this could be one of the biggest surprises coming out of the Midwestern congressional races,” said Barry Rabe, an expert on the politics of climate change at the University of Michigan. Upton was largely considered unbeatable thanks to his fourteen-term incumbency and ties to the fossil fuel industry, which has kept his campaign coffers full year after year. National environmental and political organizations like the League of Conservation Voters, the NRDC Action Fund and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee focused their efforts elsewhere. Even pollsters weren’t tracking the race, at least not publicly. Only two small super PACs got involved to help boost Clements, a political science professor at Western Michigan University. One was Climate Hawks Vote, which works to get climate-conscious candidates into office. The other was MaydayPAC, a crowdfunded group that strives to elect officials who support campaign finance reform. “There should have been more groups involved, especially more environmental groups, considering this is the chair of the House energy committee,” said RL Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote. “But they all saw it as a long shot. I got involved partly to send a message, but also because I didn’t think it was quite as long a shot.” Climate Hawks Vote runs on a shoestring budget, opting for phone banking and door-to-door campaigning instead of running more expensive print and broadcast ads. The super PAC has had someone on the ground in Michigan since the beginning of September. Its strategy has been to boast about Clements’ pro-climate action position while drawing attention to Upton’s ties to the oil industry. Upton has represented the district since",

    "content": "A record number of anti-fracking measures are on the midterm ballots—but gas drilling isn’t the only climate and environmental issue that will be put to voters on Tuesday. Americans across the country will decide on everything from climate resiliency and drought relief to oil and gas taxes and wildlife protection. Here’s InsideClimate News’ pick of the top five ballot measures to watch November 4: State: CALIFORNIA Ballot Measure: Proposition 1—Water bond Why It Matters: Would help California prepare for future droughts. The Details: If approved, this initiative would authorize the spending of $7.5 billion for water infrastructure projects, making it the fourth-largest water bond measure in California’s history. Inside the fight: California is currently in the midst of a multiyear drought that is rapidly draining its drinking and agricultural water supplies. The crisis has led to growing public awareness that climate change will fuel more frequent and severe droughts in the coming decades. Driven mostly by this new understanding, Prop 1 has received widespread bipartisan support in California, including from Gov. Jerry Brown, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, and both the California Democratic and Republican Parties. Also on board are many of the state’s business, farming and environmental groups, including the Nature Conservancy, Audubon, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the California League of Conservation Voters. Supporters have raised more than $13 million. However, there are a number of grassroots, activism-based green groups such as CREDO Action, Tar Sands Action and Food and Water Watch that oppose the bond—particularly its focus on building new dams. “Don’t let them fool you: Proposition 1 won’t provide drought relief, won’t solve California’s long-term water crisis and will continue to reward corporate greed at the expense of California taxpayers and the environment,” said Adam Scow, director of Food and Water Watch California. State: LOUISIANA Ballot Measure: Amendment 8—Constitutional amendment to create the Artificial Reef Development Fund Why It Matters: Safeguards environmental funds from being used for anything but conservation work.

    "content": "The recent dive in oil prices is undermining oil company earnings, projects and stock prices—at least for now—giving new ammunition to climate action groups pushing pensions, universities and others to purge their fossil fuel holdings. By themselves, the lower oil prices aren’t likely to convince institutions to divest from fossil fuels, especially since price swings are common in oil markets. But the unexpected dip could help the cause by casting doubt on the investment case for keeping them, according to Jamie Henn, communications director at 350.org, a leader in the growing divestment campaign. “The primary reason to divest remains the moral and political one—that if it’s wrong to wreck the planet, then it’s wrong to profit from that wreckage,” said Henn. “But the recent news about oil prices is a reminder that it’s a market that fluctuates wildly…and [oil company stocks] are not the secure investment that people often see them as.” The price of U.S. benchmark crude has been trading near $80 a barrel of late, a substantial slide from this year’s high of more than $108 a barrel in June. Oversupply and slower demand growth could force the cost of crude down $10 more before it stabilizes or reverses course, according to Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.

    "content": "Fracking has become a prominent issue in this year’s Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, energizing ads, debates and campaign appearances. The argument isn’t about whether to frack the state’s abundant natural gas reserves or even how to do it safely—but how to make money doing it. At the heart of the debate is whether to tax energy companies for extracting natural gas from the Marcellus Shale, a geologic formation rich in fossil fuels that runs underneath the western half of the state. Incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett argues that a drilling tax would drive energy companies to abandon Pennsylvania’s natural gas fields. Businessman Tom Wolf, Corbett’s Democratic challenger, says a 5 percent “severance tax” on the value of natural gas produced within its borders would provide desperately needed revenue—up to $1 billion annually—for the state’s budget, and more specifically, its education fund. Political opinion polls show the Democratic candidate winning the Nov. 4 election by approximately 20 points. If Wolf wins, it will mark the first time that an incumbent Pennsylvania governor has lost a re-election bid since the state began allowing second gubernatorial terms in the",

None. Four were exactly the climatological norm, and 90 were warmer than average. For 13 days this year, including three days this month, Lindbergh Field, the city’s official weather station near the bay, has hit 90 degrees or hotter. The average number of 90-degree days in an entire year: 1.3. Those stats are no surprise to Carolyn Ingham, who lives in the city’s North Park neighborhood, where few people have—or have ever needed—air conditioning. “I feel like all I’ve been doing is overheating and sweating,” Ingham said. “It really has just been unbearable.” For Ingham and her husband Scott and hundreds of other coastal San Diego County residents, trying to make the weather bearable proved costly. It also tested the region’s energy supplier and could be a harbinger of things to come as coastal areas get hit hard by climate change.

They were certain the cause was simply breathing the air in Greenbrier, Arkansas, the rural community to which they’d retired a decade ago. They blamed the gas wells all around them. But state officials didn’t investigate. So DeTurck leapt at the chance to help with research that posed a pressing question: What’s in the air near oil and gas production sites? The answer—in many of the areas monitored for the peer-reviewed study, published today in the journal Environmental Health—is “potentially dangerous compounds and chemical mixtures” that can make people feel ill and raise their risk of cancer. “The implications for health effects are just enormous,” said David O. Carpenter, the paper’s senior author and director of the University at Albany’s Institute for Health and the Environment. In 40 percent of the air samples, laboratory tests found benzene, formaldehyde or other toxic substances associated with oil and gas production above levels the federal government considers safe for brief or longer-term exposure, according to the study.

    "content": "Trucks hauling mounds of sand into the southern Minnesota town of Winona for delivery to drilling sites across the nation’s shale regions are not spewing dangerous dust emissions into the air, preliminary data shows. This data was released early this month, from a monitor for crystalline silica dust, or frac sand, a known trigger of lung disease. The instrument was placed along Winona’s busy truck route at the start of the year in response to local concern. Dust reached detectable levels only two out of the 38 days measured during the last seven months, according to air regulators at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Even when the dust was detected, once in June and another time in August, the levels were very low, according to Jeff Hedman, an MPCA engineer involved in the study. “We’re happy to see it,” he said. Many Winonans, including planning commissioner Ken Fritz, are relieved by the data. “I certainly think there is enough evidence out there that [shows] silica sand can create health problems in certain environments…in this case, basic information doesn’t indicate any problems,” he said. The silica monitor sits atop a two-story YMCA building downtown and was set up to capture emissions from frac trucks. But Winona’s potential dust emissions can come from more than just trucks hauling sand, there are also mining and processing facilities in town. Some citizens who live near those facilities have asked, “How do you know that you are meeting the [air] standard in my backyard?” said MPCA air monitoring unit supervisor Rick Strassman. According to the MPCA, this data is just the starting point for understanding the risks posed to the region’s air by the growing silica sand industry. Minnesota is the nation’s fourth leading producer of pure silica sand, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The nation’s top producer, Wisconsin, is just next door. Both states host vast silica reserves and have expanded their developing of the sand in recent years to keep up with growing demand from energy companies.

On Sept. 22, the online newsroom The Daily Climate launched a Kickstarter to raise $25,628 for “Climate at Your Doorstep.” The project aims to build an online community of scientists, journalists and members of the public to discuss how climate impacts are already affecting people around the country and the world. Organized around the hashtag #climatedoorstep, people will post questions, photos and observations on social media. The hash-tagged content will feed into a Daily Climate web page, and a panel of eight appointed scientific experts will respond to comments and questions. The panelists include academic scientists, such as Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University and Marshall Shepherd at the University of Georgia, and TV meteorologist Jim Gandy. Douglas Fischer, editor of The Daily Climate and a main organizer of Climate at Your Doorstep, said the goal is to help people connect the dots between global warming and visible impacts such as heat waves, wildfires, heavy rainstorms and sea level rise.

By organizing discussions on social media, ordinary citizens can get answers to questions like, “‘Why is it so wet this summer?’ or ‘Why is this frost so ridiculously early?'” Climate at Your Doorstep is one of many climate communication projects in recent years to try to deepen public understanding of the climate crisis at a time when misinformation runs rampant and political opposition to climate policy in Congress is at its strongest.

    "date": "2014-10-01T13:00:02-04:00",
    "content": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency is about to make a significant shift in the way it handles climate change. FEMA will soon require states to examine the impacts of global warming on their communities as a condition for receiving federal disaster preparedness funding, according to draft guidelines released by the agency earlier this month. The move bucks the 35-year-old agency’s longstanding trend of reacting to disasters fueled by climate change rather than preparing for them in advance, said policy analyst Rob Moore of the Natural Resources Defense Council. The decision could save FEMA a lot of money in the long run. Every dollar spent on disaster mitigation saves four dollars in disaster recovery, according to the National Institute of Building Sciences. FEMA’s budget has been stretched thin in recent years because of the increasing number of large-scale natural disasters, such as Superstorm Sandy and Hurricanes Katrina and Irene. “This decision by FEMA is the first time any federal agency has made the consideration of climate impacts a requirement for planning,” said Moore, who is director of the NRDC’s water and climate team. “Hopefully this is a sign of things to come and that other agencies will soon follow suit.” States hoping to get federal funding for disaster preparedness must conduct a formal analysis of all the risks their communities face from human-caused and natural hazards, as well as potential policies and projects to deal with these risks. The projects lessen the physical and economic impacts of disasters: They include buying sandbags for floodwaters or retrofitting buildings to withstand earthquakes. The plans must be approved by FEMA before states can get federal grant money to carry out these projects. Until this fall, FEMA never required that global warming be included in these analyses. “A few states were already incorporating climate change into their hazard mitigation plans, but overall it was spotty,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Having formal national guidance is a major step forward.” Becky Hammer, an attorney with the NRDC’s water program, said FEMA’s new guidelines are somewhat vague, stating only that hazard mitigation plans must assess “future risk in light of a changing climate.” While this makes some sense, considering that no two states are alike when it comes to risks, more detailed language could ensure that states examine their climate hazards, from droughts to wildfires to extreme temperatures to rising sea levels, more thoroughly, she said. The new rule, made alongside several others not related to climate, is open to public comment until Oct. 17. Moore and Hammer said it is unlikely to change drastically before becoming official. Together, the changes represent the first updates to FEMA’s hazard mitigation planning guidelines since",

Dozens of religious organizations and churches have signed up to join in demanding action to fight global warming. But as the Rev. Dr. Carroll A. Baltimore, former president of the Progressive National Baptist Convention, says, religious groups’ road to the march has been slow and rocky. Some factions of Christianity, such as evangelicals, have an inherent mistrust of science that for years contributed to widespread denial of climate change. Others—in poverty-stricken, minority communities, for example—put a lower priority on global warming. But as natural disasters fueled by climate change devastated the lives of billions of people, global warming became less a scientific issue and more a moral one. Religious communities across the planet began calling for action. Baltimore, currently the CEO of Global Alliance Interfaith Networks, plans to walk alongside other religious leaders in Sunday’s march. He spoke with InsideClimate News about who within the faith community has led the charge on climate change, the power of America’s clergy in shifting the nation’s climate conversation, and the impact of moral argument. This conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity. ICN: When and why did you personally start paying attention to the climate issue? Baltimore: I’ve been doing ministry in the Philippines for 30 years. I started noticing about 10 years ago that the weather patterns were changing. The rainy seasons, the typhoons, were becoming more intense and longer. You couldn’t predict it anymore. They were taking more lives. It was costing my organization more and more money to keep the ministry in the Philippines going. So I started reading and researching and watching, not just there, but in the U.S., too.

    "content": "Mark Reynolds is executive director of Citizens Climate Lobby, a grassroots organization campaign that favors a federal tax on carbon. On Sept. 21, two days before the UN Climate Summit, what’s being billed as a historic demonstration of support for action on global warming will take place in the streets of New York. Organizers expect over 100,000 participants to turn out for the People’s Climate March, elevating it to the level of events surrounding the civil rights and anti-war movements of an earlier era. But will the “arc of the moral universe”–where climate change is concerned–eventually bend towards justice? That depends on what happens after the march. To be sure, 100,000 people marching, chanting and shouting in the streets will get the attention of heads of state coming to the UN summit on Sept. 23. It might even, for a few minutes, get the attention of lawmakers in Congress, who thus far have failed to enact meaningful legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it’s not enough just to get people’s attention; we have to have a dialogue with them. That might mean that after we put down the bullhorn and the signs, we put on a jacket and tie, walk into an office and sit down to have a conversation with the people who represent us in Washington, the people who have the power to alter the destructive course our civilization has taken. That’s what the lobbyists for the coal, oil and gas industries do, and it’s worked pretty well for them. If it looks like they’re the ones calling the shots, it’s only because we let them. So, why have we ceded our democracy to special interests? What stops us from walking into our congressman’s office and having that conversation? For most Americans who care about the climate issue, the paralysis stems from a combination of hopelessness and deep-rooted cynicism about our government, our politicians, and especially this current Congress. Like many people, Jessica Langerman, a Citizens’ Climate Lobby volunteer from Massachusetts, was once hopeless about her ability to make a difference. As she wrote in an op-ed published last year: “At some point over the past few decades, I surrendered my citizenship. Not literally or consciously, but slowly, through apathy, ignorance and neglect, I gave away my civic inheritance. One too many lost environmental battles had made me feel not only besieged, but impotent. The insidious conviction that I really had no political power–or not enough to effect transformative change–took root in my mind.” The epiphany for Langerman, the moment when she reclaimed her citizenship, came during CCL’s national conference in Washington last year, where hundreds of volunteers spent two days training themselves to become effective lobbyists for a livable world. Following the training, these citizen lobbyists descended on Capitol Hill, putting their newfound skills to the test as groups of four to five volunteers met with more than 300 congressional offices throughout the week. In the initial meetings she attended, Langerman sat back and allowed the more experienced volunteers to take the lead. On her third day of lobbying, during a meeting in the office of a more conservative representative from one of the western states, she found her voice. The aide, though sympathetic, said there was too much denialism in Congress to pass legislation. Rather than belabor points on the certainty of climate science that the aide already knew, Langerman tried a different approach. She said that we buy insurance for things that have a low probability of happening, such as a house fire. Even if “there’s only a 1 percent chance that our kids will be negatively affected” by global warming, doesn’t it make sense to take out an insurance policy? Langerman continued: “To my surprise, the aide was completely silent. He held my gaze for several moments, and then murmured quietly to himself, ‘Time to buy insurance.’ He wrote down the words. “I looked around the table, and my fellow volunteers were beaming at me. For the first time in a very, very long while, I had the feeling that, as an individual citizen, I mattered. I might be rolling a stone up a hill, but, unlike Sisyphus, I had the help of every other volunteer at CCL, and together, we were making forward progress.” Langerman’s experience is not unique. Many volunteers come to CCL filled with despair, not knowing they have the power to turn this mess around. But then they get their first letter to the editor published, or that 15-minute meeting with their representative turns into a 45-minute meeting because the congressman wants to hear more. That’s when they light up, awakened to the possibility that our government still responds to the will of its people, provided the people let their government know what they want. In short, their hope is restored with the intoxicating power they discover from finding their own voice. If CCL’s rapid growth is any indication, people are ready to trade in their cynicism for a chance to make a difference. In",

    "content": "If opponents of incumbent Congressman Fred Upton (R-Mich) have their way, a natural gas pipeline leak that displaced 500 people earlier this week could take center stage in one of the nation’s most heated Congressional races. The contest for Michigan’s 6th congressional district pins fossil fuel champion Upton, a 14-term U.S. Representative and chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, against Democratic newcomer Paul Clements, a political science professor at Western Michigan University and an advocate for climate action. Early Tuesday morning, residents of Benton Charter Township, in southwestern Michigan, were evacuated from their homes after a natural gas pipeline operated by energy giant TransCanada ruptured. They were allowed to return within 12 hours of the leak, but there are still questions about how much natural gas escaped, and whether nearby soil and water were contaminated. The leak happened in a part of Michigan that is home to several pipelines carrying fossil fuels from Canada to Texas. It occurred just 80 miles west of the largest inland oil pipeline spill in U.S. history, the 1-million barrel tar sands crude leak along the Kalamazoo River in",

For the first time in the U.S. climate fight, he cleared the way to use “necessity” as a defense in the courtroom. State District Judge Joseph Macy in Fall River, Massachusetts, found the defendants could call expert witnesses to justify the violation of the law in order to protect citizens from the impacts of global warming, and to argue they had no legal alternative. His findings carry legal implications for future acts of civil disobedience, climate activists and lawyers say, and may even have had a direct impact on the outcome of this case. The litigation drew national attention earlier this week when C. Samuel Sutter, the district attorney in Bristol County, downgraded charges against two climate activists who blocked a 40,000-ton shipment of coal in",

Rusty Ruby, compliance manager for Utah’s Division of Air Quality Compliance, said the agency doesn’t have “a lot of experience” when it comes to regulating waste pits because so little is known about them, a problem common in other states where hydraulic fracturing is generating vast quantities of contaminated waste water. “It’s not like a smokestack that you can get a pretty good idea of what’s coming out,” Ruby said. In this case, the violation became clear when Utah officials discovered that Danish Flats Environmental Services had nearly doubled the size of its operation without obtaining an emissions permit. Ruby said the Colorado-based firm’s unpermitted operation was exceeding emissions regulations under the federal Clean Air Act and state law. Calls to Justin Spaeth, the company’s operations manager, were not returned. When Danish Flats began operations in",

Brian Schatz won his party’s primary race by just 1,769 votes in a hotly reported contest that lasted two years and saw millions in spending from special interests. But little reported was the 11th-hour entrance into the campaign by a tiny new SuperPAC that just may have helped seal the election for Schatz: Climate Hawks Vote. Formed in May to help get climate-conscious legislators elected to Congress, the group forewent expensive TV and print ads for old-fashioned electioneering. Volunteers made thousands of phone calls and peddled Schatz’s climate credentials on sidewalks, at environmental conferences and debate viewing parties. “Hawaii was a close enough race that we really made a difference,” according to R.L. Miller, the tireless climate advocate at the helm of the group, who’s also a lawyer, chair of the California Democratic Party’s environmental caucus and a blogger. Schatz is expected to beat his Republican challenger in November. Hawaii is just the beginning, Miller said. The organization, with its shoestring budget of $10,000, is working to get a climate advocate elected to Arizona’s Seventh Congressional District. It created a scorecard of all House Democrats’ votes and their leadership on climate issues to help guide voters. Climate Hawks Vote is also finalizing which races it will try to influence in midterm elections this fall. In an interview with InsideClimate News, Miller, 52, talked about the group’s origins, Congress’ climate problem, and how a SuperPAC can make a difference with a not-so-super budget.

With rising water already eating away at the coastline and threatening cities, Florida is largely considered ground zero for climate change in the United States. Increased flooding in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, disappearing beaches and endangered fresh water supplies are making climate change a top issue in the governor’s race, opinion polling shows. Scott spent much of his first term dismantling the climate-change initiatives of his predecessor, Charlie Crist, who’s now his Democratic opponent in the November election. Both men won nomination in Tuesday’s primary. Voters, environmentalists, scientists and the media are joining Crist in pressing Scott to acknowledge the threat that climate change poses to the state.

    "date": "2014-08-06T16:00:06-04:00",
    "content": "Eight months into his tenure as mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio still has no one at the helm of the city’s office for fighting climate change. The mayor has yet to appoint a director for the Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability, the seven-year-old department created under Mayor Michael Bloomberg that’s charged with directing, planning and coordinating the city’s ambitious climate action agenda. Under Bloomberg, the office helped transform the city by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent, retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency, and cleaning up the air, water and land. Experts warn that with no one steering the office, the progress that New York City has made on climate change could be stalled, and its reputation as a global leader on climate action damaged. “It is urgent that a director be implemented soon,” said Kizzy Charles-Guzman, director of Urban Conservation Policy at the Nature Conservancy, a 63-year-old global conservation organization based in Arlington, Virginia. “The clock is ticking on climate change and the city needs a strong, visionary leader…or it risks losing valuable momentum.” De Blasio also risks embarrassment if he has no climate strategy or leader when United Nations’ delegates assemble in New York for climate treaty talks next month, she and others said. The Sept. 23 summit coincides with Climate Week, a collection of climate-related events in New York City hosted by environmental groups and universities, and a climate rally expected to draw hundreds of thousands of protesters to Manhattan. “If [Mayor] de Blasio hasn’t named someone by then, the city won’t have a public face for Climate Week,” said Kate Sinding, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who served on de Blasio’s transition team. “That would look really bad for a city that prides itself as being a leader on the issue.” De Blasio spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said the mayor’s failure to appoint a director for the climate office doesn’t reflect a lack of commitment to addressing climate change. “From the first days of this administration, Mayor de Blasio has made a major commitment to creating a greener New York City, including a dramatic expansion of the Carbon Challenge, the first-ever mayoral office focused on resiliency, and proposing the most sweeping update to our air code since",

    "date": "2014-08-11T16:00:48-04:00",
    "content": "There is an overwhelming consensus among expert scientists studying climate change that man-made pollution is the main cause of global warming. But the media may be skewing its coverage of the issue by persistently seeking out the views of a contrarian minority, according to a new study. In an opinion survey of nearly 1,900 scientists, 90 percent of the respondents with more than 10 peer-reviewed articles to their name “explicitly agreed with anthropogenic greenhouse gases being the dominant driver of recent global warming,” the study found. It was written by scientists in the Netherlands and Australia, and published in Environmental Science and Technology. The degree of the consensus was not surprising, as scientists said they basically agreed with findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, which has itself generated exhaustive consensus documents. Surveys of published literature have likewise demonstrated the breadth of the scientific consensus on man-made climate change. “We are confident that most of the main players in climate science were invited” to respond to the survey, the authors said. And “it is likely that viewpoints that run counter to the prevailing consensus are somewhat magnified in our results” because, while a distinct minority, these contrarians were more likely to respond. Conversely, it appears that press coverage about climate science may be overweighting the views of the minority. Asked how often they have been covered in the media, those who reported the most contact with the press were those who most doubted the evidence for man-made global warming. “These differences are statistically significant (n equals 0.01 and p equals 0.04, respectively, using the ‘Fisher’s exact test’),” the authors wrote, “and indicate that those who most strongly disagree with the discernible influence of anthropogenic GHGs [greenhouse gases] on climate are overrepresented in the media.” Clarification: The authors’ full quote on their study’s statistically significant conclusions was added in the final paragraph of this story for clarification.

    "content": "Florida, the most vulnerable state in the country to climate change, faces a key election this November that could have significant ramifications for its ability to cope with the challenge of rising seas and intensifying coastal storms. If incumbent Tea Party-aligned Rick Scott is reelected governor, it is expected to mean four more years of inaction on global warming. His likely opponent, Democrat Charlie Crist, a former governor of Florida, is committed to aggressive climate action. Environmental groups, scientists and policy experts say that if Crist or another climate hawk wins, it would give the state at least a shot at staving off the worst effects of global warming. “It is critically important that the governor of Florida take action on climate change,” said Frank Jackalone, senior organizing manager of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club. “Even if the [average] forecasts for sea level rise come true, much of the state will be in trouble, areas will be wiped out and communities evacuated.” Florida is widely seen as America’s ground zero for global warming because the majority of its population and economy is concentrated along low-elevation oceanfront. The state has already experienced as much as nine inches of sea level rise along its nearly 1,200 miles of coastline. Beaches and barrier islands are starting to disappear and oceanfront cities such as Miami and Fort Lauderdale frequently flood during heavy rainstorms and full-moon high tides. Florida’s geologic makeup also poses a problem. Rising salt water is creeping through the porous rock underlying much of the state and into freshwater aquifers, threatening the drinking supply for millions of Americans. Scientists warn these problems will get worse as the climate warms and coastal development booms.

    "date": "2014-03-20T11:00:32-04:00",
    "content": "Colorado’s tough, new air pollution rules for the oil and gas industry were approved only a month ago but they’re already making an impact in Texas, where lawmakers and energy companies have long resisted tightening air standards. Several companies have approached the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund and expressed interest in discussing whether Colorado’s rules make sense for Texas, according to Jim Marston, a vice president at EDF. Marston didn’t name the companies. “The companies are often ahead of the Texas state government,” said Marston, who works in the group’s Austin office. “If some important industry leaders like the idea, it might move state government.” EDF played a leading role among the environmental organizations that helped craft the Colorado rules. Many energy companies also participated in the rule-making process, but only four of them—Anadarko Petroleum Corp., DCP Midstream, Encana Corp. and Noble Energy, Inc.—fully support the new regulations. Anadarko and DCP Midstream also operate in Texas. The Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group, had strong objections to some of the rules. For example, the association argued against requiring regular leak inspections at small storage tanks. Marston said the individual companies’ support was crucial for the rules’ approval—and would be necessary in Texas, too. “We don’t pretend we could have done it ourselves,” he said. Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas, a citizen advocacy group, also found hope in Colorado’s actions. “Frequently, legislators in this state ask for other models to look to, and Colorado, being a big oil and gas state, is somewhere Texas officials will take seriously,” he said. Neither Metzger nor Marston expects much action in Texas during this election year, when key positions, including governor and energy regulators, are being contested. In Colorado, Gov. John Hickenlooper’s office and the state’s Department of Public Health and Environment led the process. “I’d love to think we could have the support of the governor in Texas,” Marston said, “but that’s probably a lot less likely than in Colorado.” A recent eight-month investigation by InsideClimate News, the Center for Public Integrity and The Weather Channel revealed that nearly one in four of Texas’ current legislators or their spouses own stock or receive royalties from companies operating in the Eagle Ford Shale, one of the nation’s most active drilling regions. The report also found that Texas does little to monitor or limit the industry’s air pollution. The number of drilling permits issued in the Eagle Ford increased 168-fold in six years—from 26 in",

Sweet light crude from the Bakken Shale formation straddling North Dakota and Montana has long been known to be especially rich in volatile natural gas liquids like propane. Much of the oil is being shipped in railcars designed in the",

In both the United States and Canada, activism against tar sands, pipelines and climate change has soared in recent years. But while President Obama has encouraged citizens to “stand up and speak up” to demand change on energy, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s administration has tried to silence critics of pro-tar sands policies. In the most recent evidence, seven influential environmental organizations have become the subject of rigorous audits by the Canada Revenue Agency. Activists allege that the scrutiny is an attempt by the Harper administration to subdue tar sands opponents as decision time looms for pipelines needed to bring Alberta’s landlocked oil to market—the Texas-bound Keystone XL and the Northern Gateway to the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. “Canadians are starting to understand that the government has overstepped and overreached in its attacks against environmentalists and scientists,” said Tzeporah Berman, a Vancouver-based environmentalist and co-founder of the activist group ForestEthics. “We’re seeing a growing grassroots movement as a result. … People are angry.” The prime minister’s office directed requests for comment to the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA).

It is perhaps surprising, then, that the U.S. agency in charge of preparing for and responding to these disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), doesn’t account for climate change in most of its budget planning and resource allocation or in the National Flood Insurance Program it administers. “Climate change is affecting everything the agency does, and yet it isn’t given much consideration,” said Michael Crimmins, an environmental scientist at the University of Arizona who is leading a project to try to improve FEMA’s use of climate science data. “FEMA has to be climate literate in a way that many other agencies don’t have to be.” A main problem, he and other experts say, is that FEMA doesn’t use short- or long-term climate science projections to determine how worsening global warming may affect its current operations and the communities it serves. Instead, FEMA continues to base its yearly budget and activities almost entirely on historical natural disaster records. That practice is exacerbated by the fact that the agency is at the mercy of economic and political pressures. In addition to having to deal with years of recession that ate into its budget, FEMA has repeatedly been caught in the crosshairs of partisan politics that forced funding cuts and blocked proposed increases. And so while the number of billion-dollar-plus weather disasters in the United States has increased five percent a year since",

    "date": "2013-12-19T22:00:51-05:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—An independent Canadian federal panel on Thursday approved Enbridge’s proposal to build a new pipeline from the tar sands of Alberta to the British Columbia coast, a significant gain in the industry’s long campaign to find export markets for the nation’s abundant but carbon-heavy form of crude oil. The panel set 209 conditions on the project as a way to overcome environmental and safety concerns. Even that, it said, would not guarantee that there would be no environmental harm. But its central message was that the economic interest in building the line was paramount—”that Canadians will be better off with this project than without it.” “We are of the view that opening Pacific Basin markets is important to the Canadian economy and society,” the panel declared. “Societal and economic benefits can be expected from the project. “We find that the environmental burdens associated with project construction and routine operation can generally be effectively mitigated,” it went on. “Some environmental burdens may not be fully mitigated in spite of reasonable best efforts and techniques.” “The environmental, societal, and economic burdens of a large oil spill, while unlikely and not permanent, would be significant,” the panel said. “Through our conditions we require Northern Gateway to implement appropriate and effective spill prevention measures and spill response capabilities, so that the likelihood and consequences of a large spill would be minimized.” The Conservative federal government—led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper—welcomed the recommendation, which had been widely anticipated. Ottowa’s final decision is expected within months, and will almost certainly be positive. “The Panel’s report represents a rigorous, open and comprehensive science-based assessment,” said Joe Oliver, Canada’s minister of natural resources. “Our Government will continue to improve the safe transportation of energy products across Canada,” he said. “No project will be approved unless it is safe for Canadians and safe for the environment.” Opponents, including aboriginal First Nation groups whose rights are protected by law and treaty, said they would carry on the fight in court and in protests. “This project will never be built,” said Chief Martin Louie of the Nadleh Whut’en First Nation. “We have drawn a line in the earth they cannot, and will not, cross.” If the Northern Gateway project goes ahead, it could have ramifications in the United States, where the Alberta-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline proposal has been challenged and is in the late stages of review by the Obama administration. Proponents of that project have said that TransCanada’s application for a presidential permit for its Keystone XL should be approved, because if it’s denied, the Canadian tar sands will simply find some other route to market. That reasoning may be strengthened by the review board’s moving the Northern Gateway closer to reality. The 730-mile pipeline would carry more than half a million barrels of tar sands crude from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia, where it would be loaded onto tankers and shipped across the Pacific to markets in Asia. It is part of a multi-pronged effort by tar sands producers and their allies to gain access to export markets—either by shipping diluted bitumen, or dilbit, from the oil sands across Canada to the east and west, or by shipping it south across the U.S. midsection to refineries on the Gulf Coast through the Keystone XL and other pipelines. The goal is to double or triple tar sands output in the decades ahead, clearing the transportation bottlenecks that have depressed prices for tar sands crude, and getting Canada’s vast reserves onto more lucrative markets outside North America. Environmentalists have focused their opposition to the Northern Gateway and other pipelines on three concerns: the ecological damage done by tar sands operations in Alberta itself; the risks of spills during shipment; and the implications for global warming of steadily increasing output of tar sands bitumen, which has an extraordinarily high carbon footprint. The long Northern Gateway review, carried out by an independent three-person panel under the federal environment agency and the National Energy Board, included public hearings over 18 months, with hundreds of witnesses appearing and thousands of statements submitted for consideration. Cross-examination of some witnesses dragged on for days. The company and the government of Alberta had both expressed confidence that they would get regulatory approval. They and many outside experts had said that they expected the board to set conditions on moving ahead. It was not really a surprise that the board set so many. Several of the most important conditions, the panel said, were intended to reduce the risk of a large spill. These included thicker pipe, additional safety valves and detection systems, rerouting the pipelines away from major rivers and using trenchless river crossings where possible, escorting tankers with tugboats, and so on. “Some level of risk is inherent,” it said, “no party could guarantee that a large spill would not occur.” The panel was even somewhat sanguine about the worst case. “We found that, in the unlikely event of a large oil spill, there will be significant adverse environmental effects, and that functioning ecosystems recover through mitigation and natural processes,” it said. “We found that a large oil spill would not cause permanent, widespread damage to the environment … Scientific research from past spill events indicates that the environment recovers to a state that supports functioning ecosystems similar to those existing before the spill.” As to the particular dangers of a spill involving dilbit, which has proven exceptionally difficult and expensive to clean up, the panel put the best face on this as well. “In our view, Northern Gateway’s research commitments regarding the behavior and cleanup of heavy oils spilled in aquatic environments and the company’s enhanced fate and trajectory modelling will further inform emergency preparedness and response planning for the project. This research will also contribute to other current and proposed research,” it said. Pipeline critics objected that the review panel had not taken into effect the implications of the Northern Gateway for continuing tar sands development and the greenhouse gas emissions that would come with it. “Without a credible plan to address greenhouse gas pollution and to ensure the oil sands are being developed in an environmentally responsible manner, building the infrastructure that enables rapid oil sands expansion cannot be in the public interest,” said Joshua McNab, British Columbia director at the Pembina Institute.

Resiliency includes adaptation measures—such as rebuilding wetlands or moving homes onto higher foundations as a way to fight floods—but it’s also about armoring entire populations so they can absorb and quickly recover from sudden calamity. Resiliency is “a more holistic perspective on creating stronger and more prepared communities,” said Brian Holland, the director of climate programs at ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, a nonprofit based in Germany with U.S. headquarters in Oakland, Calif. “We’re not just reacting to climate change.

    "date": "2013-12-09T12:00:46-05:00",
    "content": "As Mayor Michael Bloomberg winds down his last month in office, his plan for protecting New York City from the threats of climate change has received an important boost. But there is still uncertainty over whether his successor, Bill de Blasio, has any interest in carrying forward Bloomberg’s legacy on combating global warming. New York last week was one of 33 cities worldwide selected to participate in the first round of the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities Network. The initiative grants cities undetermined portions of a $100 million pot of money for hiring a “chief resilience officer” and developing long-term resiliency plans to assess and tackle risks they face from climate and other disasters. New York is ahead of the curve on both issues. It already has a director of resiliency in the Mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, as well as a comprehensive strategy in its Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (SIRR)—a $19.5 billion plan unveiled in June in response to Superstorm Sandy. The plan includes 257 initiatives spread across the city, about one-quarter of which could be completed before Bloomberg leaves office. The Rockefeller support could help New York implement the rest of the plan and cement the city’s reputation for being at the forefront of climate action. But all that is essentially up to Mayor-elect de Blasio, and it remains uncertain whether his administration will keep climate change at the top of the agenda. The keys to Bloomberg’s success in developing a comprehensive climate strategy included his constant, outspoken support for global warming action and his administration’s nonstop consultation with the city’s top scientists, experts and environmental organizations. MORE: Bloomberg’s Hidden Legacy: Climate Change and the Future of New York City, the story behind the historic effort by Mayor Bloomberg to safeguard New York from the effects of climate change. Since the November election, de Blasio has given praise to Bloomberg’s resiliency plan, but he has offered no specifics and has not said whether he will advance Bloomberg’s climate plan or develop his own. “I think the resiliency plan he put forward is a great blueprint for the future of this city,” de Blasio said in a televised mayoral debate weeks before the Nov. 5 elections. “On resiliency, I actually think he’s right.” Among the 19 topics listed in de Blasio’s issues section on his campaign website, climate resiliency is last. Sustainability is 11th on the list. On the campaign trail, he focused on traditional hot-button issues such as education, affordable housing and Bloomberg’s controversial “stop and frisk” police policy. The Bloomberg administration applied to be in the Rockefeller network over the summer. And while it’s unlikely de Blasio would pull out of the initiative—it’s essentially free money and services for New York City—the mayor-elect could choose to sideline the effort and make climate issues less of a priority. De Blasio’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Daniel Zarrilli, the city’s resiliency director, didn’t seem concerned. He joined the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability in June to carry out the mayor’s SIRR program—one of the most ambitious and scientifically accurate plans of its kind in the world. Zarrilli and a team of about 30 city staffers worked around the clock to develop the plan in six months so that Bloomberg could start implementing some of its climate initiatives before leaving office. “We’re going to work with everyone we need to, to make sure resiliency stays on the agenda of New York City,” he told InsideClimate News. He said the sustainability office recently supplied de Blasio’s transition team with a lengthy briefing on the city’s ongoing activities, near-term plans and long-term concerns, which the de Blasio camp is still mulling over. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg administration has done what it can to keep its environmental measures in place. The sustainability office, for instance, is a permanent institution that is legally required to continue working on climate resiliency, and it would take a vote by the New York City Council to dismantle it. Councilmembers in recent months have passed dozens of the city’s resiliency proposals, including a batch of green building laws meant to better prepare properties for future storms. The Rockefeller Foundation itself has outlined five “resilience recommendations” for de Blasio to complete in his first 100 days in office. The list includes hiring a deputy mayor for economic development and resilience, and creating a public-private infrastructure bank for resiliency projects. ‘It’s the Things You Need to Survive’ The Rockefeller Foundation announced the 100 Resilient Cities initiative in May to mark the centennial of the nonprofit’s founding. Nearly 400 cities applied this summer to join the network, and two more rounds of winners will be announced in the next couple of years. The goal is to make resiliency planning a staple of city work, as institutionalized as education or health services, said Michael Berkowitz, the network’s managing director. “There aren’t good places where city managers can turn to look for how to address some of these issues,” he said. “We wanted to support this new community of practice. … At the end of the day, it’s the things that you need to survive.” It’s part of a larger attempt to help cities carry out aggressive plans to guard against climate impacts, natural disasters, public health crises and security threats as more people move into urban environments.

    "date": "2013-11-11T13:00:44-05:00",
    "content": "A college town in southern Minnesota is taking action against the frac sand industry that’s booming amid America’s drilling revolution. Winona, Minn. will become the first local government in the nation to monitor air pollution that may be escaping from mounds of sand being trucked through town for delivery to fracking fields in North Dakota and elsewhere. The move puts the city of 28,000 people at the forefront of initial efforts to address the health effects of silica sand, an ingredient used in fracking that has been linked to lung disease. It is part of a larger trend to understand the various impacts of natural gas and oil development on communities. The data Winona collects will be used to determine if the city is within pollution standards set by the federal and state government, and it could help other towns build a case for monitoring frac sand pollution. “This is not a specific city’s problem—it’s a regional problem,” said Jim Gurley, co-founder of the Winona-based grassroots group Citizens Against Silica Mining. In the past few years, the U.S. frac sand industry has ballooned from a dozen or so mines to hundreds in order to support growing demand from frackers—which use 10,000 tons of silica sand to frack a single well. Much of the boom is in Wisconsin, the biggest producer of frac sand in the United States. Winona, which is near the Wisconsin border and on the Mississippi River, has become a key transport corridor for shipping Wisconsin’s frac sand to drilling sites. Every day about 100 trucks carrying thousands of tons of sand move through U.S. Highway 43 that cuts across the city. The sand is loaded onto rail or barge and sent to North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas. Minnesota law requires tarps covering the haulers. But many residents remain worried about the potential impact of silica dust emissions and diesel exhaust. The extent and effect of pollution from mining, processing and transporting frac sand is only partially understood. The biggest concern is the release of extra-tiny dust matter called PM 2.5, which are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and can penetrate lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. There are few monitoring tools at frac sand mines for PM 2.5 and none at transport hubs. Silica dust exposure kills hundreds of industrial sand workers a year, according to federal data. Holly Lenz, an assistant professor of public health at Winona State University who first proposed the monitors, said children, the elderly and people with chronic disease are most at risk from respiratory illness. “We’ve got the college students and a lot of older citizens,” she said. “We want to make sure we are protecting” everyone. Under Winona’s plan, two air pollution sensors will be installed atop a YMCA next to the busiest road for frac sand truck traffic. One will measure concentrations of particulate matter measuring 4 micrometers in diameter, or PM 4. The other will measure the finer PM 2.5 particles. Frank Kohlasch, manager of the air assessment section of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, which will fund the monitors and collect and analyze the data, said he does not believe that dust blowing off frac sand trucks is “an imminent problem right now.” The push for monitoring has faced little resistance from the frac sands industry. The safety guideline for PM 2.5 set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and used by Minnesota is 12 micrograms per cubic meter over a one-year period. This summer, Minnesota adopted California’s stringent standard for PM 4, which says the particle should remain below 3 micrograms per cubic meter. The Winona City Council is slated to vote on a final proposal later this month. It is expected to win easy approval. The first data will likely be collected in January",

    "content": "Three years ago, Franke James was a little-known artist who found herself blacklisted by the Canadian government for making art that lambasted the rapidly expanding tar sands. Infuriated and emboldened by the censure, James churned out a slew of pieces criticizing the government, published a book and in the process became one of Canada’s most outspoken environmental activists. Now, the Toronto resident is embarking on a new mission. She wants to raise awareness in the United States about what she believes are Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s continuing undemocratic tactics to squash opposition to his oil agenda. In doing so, she hopes to help persuade the Obama administration to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. The contentious project would carry 830,000 barrels a day of tar sands crude from Alberta to Texas and open a gateway for the flow of the dirtier grade of oil to export markets abroad. A decision is expected next year. “American policymakers need to understand just who they will be doing business with if they approve the Keystone and the extreme measures they take to get their way,” James said in an interview. “The Canadian government’s efforts to silence environmental and scientific voices are wrong.” Through October and most of November, James’ poster art criticizing Harper and the Keystone XL will be displayed at Washington, D.C. bus stops along Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues near the White House and the Capitol. The five-figure ad-buy was paid for by three U.S. environmental groups—Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation—as well as through crowd-funding. SLIDESHOW: 6 Posters by Franke James, Canada’s Blacklisted Climate Activist Artist Earlier this month James and other Canadian environmentalists who oppose the Keystone met with Democratic Congressional staffers and State Department officials.

In three short years, dozens of small towns on Wisconsin’s western edge have become an epicenter for mining silica sand, a necessary ingredient in the fracking process that has been implicated in thousands of cases of silicosis, a lung disease. It can take up to 10,000 tons of sand to frack a single well during its lifetime, and there are roughly 50 new wells being drilled in the United States every day.

    "content": "In the six months since an ExxonMobil pipeline unleashed Canadian oil in an Arkansas neighborhood, nearby residents have had much to endure—the muck and stench of heavy crude, lengthy evacuations, sickness and economic loss. They’ve also been in the national spotlight, as the upheaval in tiny Mayflower, Ark., has come to symbolize the risks of aging and overlooked oil pipelines, especially when they’re hundreds of miles long and carrying tar sands crude. From Illinois through Texas, many people who live along the pipeline’s route are now worrying about whether or when the ruptured line will resume pumping oil through 858 miles of fields, waterways, cities and suburban backyards. “I have no say, and I have no idea what’s going to happen,” said Mayflower resident Ann Jarrell, whose home is not far from where the Pegasus pipeline split open on March 29. “That’s the worst part—the not knowing.” That nagging uncertainty, however, is likely to persist for many more months. For starters, federal regulators have not finished investigating the spill. And while tests determined that a manufacturing flaw set the stage for the 65-year-old pipeline’s rupture, officials have not said what caused the defect to progress to failure and what other factors played a role in the spill. What’s more, the recent government shutdown added further delay to the analysis, which is being conducted by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Exxon, meanwhile, is not pressing to restart the line. Even though the lengthy outage is costing the company as much as $450,000 a day in lost revenue—totaling as much as $90 million so far—Exxon is proceeding slowly, conducting additional tests and digging down to the pipeline in places to assess its condition. That caution could reflect fears that the Pegasus problems might be systemic and costly to solve. But analysts say Exxon also is mindful that additional leaks could sink its chances of salvaging the line for good and also undermine public support for new pipeline projects such as the controversial Keystone XL. Like the Pegasus, the proposed Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL would carry tar sands oil to U.S. refineries. However, the line’s critical northern segment (from Canada to Nebraska) has been stalled for five years as builder TransCanada tries to win U.S. State Department approval amid a heated debate over the pipeline’s merits and environmental and climate impacts. Several other major pipeline projects could be affected by the Pegasus case because they would reverse the flow inside older, existing pipelines to accommodate Canada’s surging production of heavy oil—which is what Exxon did with the Pegasus in",

    "content": "Peter Davidson walked nervously toward a U.S. Senate conference room in Washington, D.C. A lanky man with graying, wavy hair and thick-rimmed glasses, he was still studying the notes he had prepared when he stepped inside to face a dozen members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. “My name is Peter Davidson,” he said as he slid into a black leather chair and pulled a microphone close. “I recently joined the Department of Energy as executive director of the Loan Programs Office…one of the largest clean energy and transportation portfolios in the world.” Though few outside Washington know it, the Energy Department’s eight-year-old Loan Programs Office is at the center of the nation’s highly political battle over clean energy. The program backs innovative energy projects that can’t get private financing because their technology is too new and risky. Davidson, a former investment banker and entrepreneur, is charged with bringing the 180-person office back to life. Two years earlier it had been rocked by controversy when Solyndra, the solar company that took $527 million in loans, went bankrupt. Although the loss represented a small fraction of the program’s $34.4 billion loan portfolio, the office became one of the most maligned and disliked federal programs. Congressional Republicans used it as a cudgel against Obama’s clean energy programs. Lawmakers tried several times to block future spending by the office—to no avail. Davidson was the first member of the loan office to appear before the Senate in more than a year, and the program’s first permanent head in 18 months. His nervousness—and excitement—at the July 18 hearing on clean energy initiatives underscored the challenge he faces. If he can relaunch the program, dozens of high-risk but big-payoff technologies could get off the ground, hastening the clean energy transformation and helping to rein in global warming emissions. If he can’t, those projects might never see the light of day. “I think Peter would need to be a little crazy not to be apprehensive” going into it, said Ed Hatcher, a longtime friend and P.R. consultant who helped Davidson prepare for the hearing. Now that the Solyndra scandal has died down, President Obama is eyeing the remaining $50 billion that Congress appropriated years ago to help achieve his far-reaching plan for global warming. Most of that money—$42 billion—is earmarked for nuclear power and advanced car technologies, with a small amount for renewable energy and energy efficiency. Two nuclear projects are already slated to get funding. Davidson’s first task is to funnel the other $8 billion into technologies that can reduce emissions from extracting and burning fossil fuels. Some say it’s a controversial move that could lead to complaints that the office is pandering to clean-energy opponents. The initiative is “really a key part of what [Obama] is trying to do” on climate change, Davidson said in an interview near his home in Brooklyn, N.Y. Today, after nearly five months on his first federal job, Davidson, who is known for his cool temperament and genial nature, said he’s “energized” by his new vocation. “We can’t be defensive,” he said about the loan program. “We’ve got to be very excited about what he have to offer.” ‘The Only Game in Town’ for Big Clean Energy Davidson, 54, has virtually no previous experience dealing with Washington politics and scandals, but he’s a pro at raising and investing money in big-ticket ventures. For nearly three decades, the Harvard Business School graduate worked in finance in New York, first as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley and then as entrepreneur. He founded and managed six companies, including the Spanish-language media conglomerate, Latin Communications Group. When it comes to debt finance, “I just really respect it and understand it,” he said. Davidson left the private sector in",

    "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.—Arkansas state legislators leery of lax federal oversight of oil pipelines have attempted to beef up safety standards to try to prevent another disastrous spill in their own backyard. They’re aware, however, that their efforts are largely symbolic. That’s because, in most instances, a state statute cannot infringe on the federal government’s constitutional authority to set and enforce rules about petroleum pipelines. But for local lawmakers trying to calm constituent fears after a 65-year-old pipeline burst in central Arkansas, going it alone seemed the only option in an environment where the U.S. Congress and federal regulators seem incapable of strengthening rules that pipeline safety advocates perceive as weak and ineffective. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) regulates most of the country’s liquid fuel pipelines. That includes ExxonMobil’s beleaguered Pegasus pipeline, which stretches 850 miles across four states from Patoka, Ill., to Nederland, Texas. Earlier this year PHMSA’s top pipeline safety official, Jeffrey Wiese, said the regulatory process he oversees is “kind of dying.” He announced that his agency is creating a YouTube channel to persuade industry to voluntarily improve safety at a time when it can take up to three years to issue a new regulation. Arkansas passed what basically amounts to an advisory law in April, barely a month after at least 210,000 gallons of Canadian heavy tar sands crude belched from the Pegasus into a neighborhood roughly 20 miles northwest of Little Rock on March 29. That calamity was an eye-opener about how poorly operators and regulators have monitored and maintained the nation’s aging and vulnerable pipeline network. (MORE: Exclusive: Pipeline Safety Chief Says His Regulatory Process Is ‘Kind of Dying’) The three-page law “encourages” but does not force petroleum pipeline companies to take a series of safety measures, which are stricter than the federal government’s, on lines that cross watersheds that supply drinking water. The bill’s goal is to compel companies to detect ruptures rapidly so they can speed up response time. It encourages pipeline operators to install cut-off valves that automatically sense lower flow in a pipeline and that can be automatically and manually shut off on either side of a river, stream, lake or reservoir. It also asks operators to provide training and funding for emergency responders. In addition, the law calls for operators to identify the chemical composition of oil flowing through a pipeline; remove above-ground pipeline crossings, install additional valves and valve controls; and create a risk mitigation and response plan that includes quarterly visual inspections of all pipelines. Reps. John Edwards, a Democrat, and co-sponsor Andy Davis, a Republican, shepherded the pipeline safety bill through the Arkansas General Assembly. Edwards said he knew he had to tread carefully with the language in the bipartisan legislation because states can’t dictate pipeline safety. Simply put, PHMSA and pipeline operators can ignore local laws that try to pre-empt or override federal authority. PHMSA spokesman Damon Hill told InsideClimate News that the Arkansas law wouldn’t conflict with federal regulations because it “encourages” but doesn’t “require” stricter safety standards. Edwards: Clean Water Can’t Be Compromised The Mayflower spill spurred Edwards into action because the Pegasus broke so close to Lake Maumelle, a drinking water source that serves 400,000 customers in and around Little Rock. The name of the law, “An Act to Improve Economic Opportunities in Arkansas by Protecting the Water Resources of the State” reflects his effort to attract votes among fellow legislators worried about the havoc a broken pipeline could cause if water were compromised. “For me, it goes back to the point that moral authority has no boundaries,” Edwards said about his decision to pursue legislation—even though pipeline operators in Arkansas could choose to ignore it. “As an elected official, you have an obligation to speak out and do what you can with something that impacts everyone. Clean, safe drinking water is one of those issues.” About 1,805 miles of the nation’s 194,157 miles of liquid fuel pipelines run through Arkansas. Exxon spokesman Aaron Stryk did not say whether the company would follow the Arkansas law. Instead, he told InsideClimate News in an e-mail that “our commitment to operating in an environmentally responsible manner is anchored in our Environment Policy, which fosters appropriate operating practices and training, and requires our facilities to be designed, operated and managed with the goal of preventing environmental incidents.” Anthony Swift, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit advocacy organization, lauded Edwards for trying to send a message to the U.S. Congress and PHMSA about the current shortcomings of pipeline safety. Counties and states can’t just throw up their hands and say they are helpless, said Swift, who has spent years studying pipeline safety issues. It’s incumbent on state officials to represent their constituents’ needs so federal regulators and the pipeline industry aren’t the only representatives at the table, he added. “When we say that all politics is local, it’s true,” he said. “If local lawmakers don’t push their federal lawmakers to change the system, the system is not going to change.” South Dakota County Strikes Out While PHMSA sets oil pipeline safety via federal standards, local legislators are allowed to address pipeline siting and spill response issues without superseding federal powers. That means they can have a say on where a pipeline is buried and on what type of post-spill cleanup response is expected. But they cannot demand that pipeline operators lower the pressure on their lines, conduct more inspections, construct their pipelines with thicker steel or add sensors that detect spills because those safety measures are federally regulated. Local legislators in South Dakota who tried to propose an ordinance that went beyond federal pipeline siting and spill response found out just how large a hammer PHMSA can yield. More than five years ago, worries about the proposed Keystone XL prompted the Spink County Commission in South Dakota to direct its volunteer zoning board to design an ordinance just in case an oil pipeline was ever constructed in the county. Neither the first Keystone pipeline, completed in",

    "date": "2013-08-21T10:00:09-04:00",
    "content": "MAYFLOWER, Ark.—Homeowners whose lives are still in limbo after thousands of gallons of oil streamed into their neighborhood from a ruptured pipeline on March 29 might never know precisely how much of the sticky black goo oil actually spilled. The working estimate is that 5,000 barrels—210,000 gallons—of Canadian heavy crude oil poured from a 22-foot break in ExxonMobil’s Pegasus pipeline on that Good Friday afternoon. But officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Exxon say the actual amount can’t be figured until the Pegasus is up and running again. That will allow Exxon to do a mathematical calculation while the line is operating at the same flow as it was when it broke open. However, that scenario could prove problematic. It’s quite possible that the beleaguered pipeline, which stretches 850 miles across four states from Patoka, Ill., to Nederland, Texas, will never reopen. And, even if it does someday pump oil again, federal regulators have ordered Exxon to permanently reduce its operating pressure. Karen Tyrone, vice president for operations of ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last week that retiring Pegasus “is within the realm of possibilities.” The 65-year-old line was manufactured using a welding process that’s now known to be defective and with a type of pipe that is inherently brittle and prone to cracking, according to documents filed with federal regulators. (Read: Exxon Knew Its Ruptured Pipeline Was Old, Defective and Brittle, and Still Added New Stresses) Figuring out an accurate count on barrels spilled is crucial because that number will help determine the size of the fines Exxon will face under the federal Clean Water Act. Civil penalties could range from $1,100 to $4,300 per barrel, depending on whether Exxon is found guilty of negligence or willful misconduct. Penalties for a 5,000-barrel spill could range from $5.5 million to $21.5 million. The size of an oil spill can be determined in several ways. Calculations can be made from data that the pipeline operator collected at the time of the spill. A count also can be based on the amount of oil collected during a cleanup, as the EPA’s Chicago-based Region 5 is doing in Michigan, where the nation’s largest oil pipeline spill occurred in",

    "content": "MAYFLOWER, Ark.—Anything for his treasured fishing hole. That was the mantra cycling through Jimmy Joe Johnson’s head on the afternoon of Friday, March 29 as he rushed to keep a filthy stream of crude oil from spilling out of a cove and into the main body of Lake Conway. Standing at the edge of the lake more than four months later, Johnson had his fingers crossed that his efforts that day weren’t for naught. Officials with the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) say they feel certain that soon-to-come results from sediment testing will confirm what water tests revealed—that no oil reached the main body of the lake. But Johnson won’t stop fretting until he sees definitive proof that the lake wasn’t sullied. Johnson’s lookout on this steamy August day is roughly nine-tenths of a mile from the spot where oil from ExxonMobil’s ruptured Pegasus pipeline gushed into a subdivision of neat, brick homes. Instinct and familiarity with the local topography guided Johnson and a crew of locals to this site on that fateful Friday afternoon—a man-made dike about the length of a football field and wide enough to support two lanes of State Highway 89 traffic. The dike isolates a 30-acre, elbow-shaped cove thick with lily pads from the sprawling 6,700-acre Lake Conway. On the day of the spill, Johnson knew he and his team were too late to keep oil out of the cove. But they were intent on stopping the plume of black goo before it contaminated the main body of a lake renowned in central Arkansas for its stocked bounty of catfish, crappie, bluegill and bass. “We had one mission and that was to keep the oil out of the lake,” Johnson, superintendent of the Mayflower streets department for 15 years, told InsideClimate News. “Once I figured out where the bust was, there was no doubt the oil was headed to Lake Conway. We used everything we had.” (Read: Cove Where Exxon Oil Has Been Found Is Part of Lake Conway) Johnson joined volunteer firefighters and public works employees from Faulkner County and Mayflower equipped with dump trucks and backhoes. Together, they scrambled to position plywood, dirt, rocks and close to 1,000 tons of gravel to construct barricades to keep oily water from surging over or through the dike. One of their first jobs was plugging a pair of 48-inch metal pipes connecting the cove and the main lake. Meanwhile, pumps sucked water from the bottom of the cove so it wouldn’t overflow into the lake. “We was part of a big team,” said Johnson, 50, who grew up fishing in the lake and playing in its network of nearby streams. “We was working to save our lake.” Ryan Benefield, the ADEQ’s deputy director, is confident the local crew did just that. So far, water tests in the main lake conducted by the agency have shown no signs of diluted bitumen, Benefield said. That’s the type of heavy Canadian crude that the Pegasus was carrying when it broke. It’s also the type of oil that the Keystone XL pipeline will carry if it is approved. Sediment testing throughout the spill corridor, roughly a mile long, began July 27 as the spill cleanup evolved from “response” mode, overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to the “remediation” phase, coordinated by ADEQ. Results of the sediment tests are not yet available, Benefield said. He is convinced the sediment tests also will bring good news because water tests have repeatedly come back clean enough to be below any level of concern. “We haven’t seen anything in the main body of the lake indicating that it has been affected by the oil spill,” Benefield said. “There’s just no opportunity for the sediments to be impacted.” Much of the lake is quite shallow, measuring barely six feet deep, Benefield said. Heavy metals found in diluted bitumen are a major concern with any such spill. These compounds, which include mercury, manganese, nickel and chromium, are toxic at high doses. Some, such as arsenic and lead, can damage the human nervous system even at relatively low doses. (Read: Full Extent of Heavy Metal Contamination in Exxon Oil Spill Still Unknown) Neighbors Suspect Oil in Lake Genieve Long, a 28-year-old mother and full-time college student who has lived next to Lake Conway all of her life, patrols the lake regularly. She is suspicious of the testing done by ExxonMobil and state authorities, she said, because she doesn’t think they are testing lake channels where she is sure currents carried oil connected with the spill. Oil had time to breach the State Highway 89 dike before Johnson and other workers built barricades and blocked the pair of culverts, Long said. “I have a very good knowledge of what goes on in the lake,” she said. “My father was a fisherman who taught me about fish and currents. I’m not trying to cause trouble. I’m trying to make problems go away. I’m concerned about the environment and about people’s health, and that they aren’t getting the attention they need.” Long said she felt rebuffed by ADEQ officials when she told them several times that she had observed oil near the cove where her family lives. “They told me it was nothing to worry about, that it’s just natural organisms decomposing,” she said. “I know the difference between what I’m seeing and what I’ve seen all of my life. I have fished this lake, played in this lake, even waded out in it when I was a kid. I know what this lake looked like before the spill.” In",

    "content": "MAYFLOWER, Ark.—ExxonMobil did an about-face in Arkansas last week after local politicians criticized the company’s plan to stop paying victims of the March 29 Pegasus pipeline spill for temporary housing. Twenty-two homes on North Starlite Road were evacuated after the pipeline sent a stream of heavy Canadian crude oil down their block. Since then Exxon has dug up the contaminated soil around the houses and replaced it with new dirt and fresh sod. It has also been testing the soil and the interior of the homes for benzene and other chemicals. Exxon apparently decided that the neighborhood was in such good shape that it was time for the evacuees to begin moving back into their homes. To push them in that direction, company reps told some families that Exxon wouldn’t pay for temporary housing beyond August 31. That came as a surprise to displaced residents who, lawmakers said, had been told the company would cover their replacement housing for at least six months after the disaster. “It’s horrible,” said Amber Bartlett, whose home on North Starlite is half a block from the source of the spill. “They want us to go back now. We’re not comfortable with that, because no one really knows if long-term health effects are linked to exposure to this.” When local politicians got word of what was happening last week they went public with their concerns—and on Friday Exxon announced that it will continue the payments indefinitely. “Each resident is going to be different,” said Exxon spokesman Aaron Stryk. “We’re going to work with them to meet their individual needs. If they need more time, we’ll look at each individual situation and find the best solution.” ExxonMobil is still proceeding with deals to buy homes from some residents, Stryk said. One of Exxon’s harshest critics last week was U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin, a past recipient of ExxonMobil campaign funds and usually an outspoken supporter of the pipeline industry. Griffin is a Republican whose district includes Mayflower. On Thursday he sent a letter to Exxon suggesting the company offer temporary housing “to these victims of the spill” until the end of the year, at least. “I am angered and deeply concerned,” the letter said, “that ExxonMobil would prematurely terminate housing assistance for these residents, forcing them to either move back into their homes or pay the full cost of alternative housing.” State Sen. David Sanders (R) also criticized the company’s plan. “This is cut and dry. It’s simple,” he said. “You simply apply the old do-right rule in this instance. For some [families] it’s continuing to work with them and negotiate on the sale of the homes. For some, it’s to give them more time.” Sanders said he noticed a commonality among the affected residents he’d spoken to: They hadn’t hired lawyers. Stryk said Exxon has worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Arkansas Department of Health to ensure that air in the homes isn’t poisonous. Of the 22 homes that were officially evacuated after the spill, Exxon believes several have been deemed safe for occupancy. Two residents have moved back into their homes, and Stryk said other residents are “in various stages of moving back.” Bartlett, her husband, Ches, and their four children do not plan to be among the returnees. Because of their concerns about possible health risks from the chemicals in the oil, she said the family intends to sell their home to ExxonMobil. In recent months they’ve been living in a trailer home they rented from a friend. Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, whose office is investigating the Pegasus spill, continued his criticism of the company on Friday. “Although I am happy that Exxon has retreated from the cold-hearted policy that it announced just yesterday, I am again frustrated with the company,” McDaniel said in a statement. “I am angry that families had to experience that level of stress and that it took so much public outcry for Exxon to change its position.” InsideClimate News and the Arkansas Times have raised money through the ioby.org crowd-funding site to send two reporters—Sam Eifling and Elizabeth McGowan—to Arkansas to cover the spill and its consequences.

    "content": "As President Barack Obama begins the gargantuan task of selling his climate agenda to the American people, in his corner are wealthy donors he can count on to help him get what he wants. From Wall Street whizzes to franchise owners, these donors have poured time and money to further the president’s climate agenda. But two stand out: Tom Steyer, a San Francisco-based hedge fund manager, and Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder. Steyer and Hughes are hardly equal counterweights to the billionaire Koch brothers—two of Obama’s fiercest opponents—who for decades have quietly used their wealth and influence to thwart action on climate change. Charles and David Koch are each worth $34 billion, according to Forbes. Steyer is worth about $1.4 billion and Hughes about $700 million. Still, these newcomers to the fray are helping level the playing field in what has long been a lopsided fight inside the Beltway for America’s energy future. Steyer, an Obama donor and friend, is a longtime clean energy champion who was once considered for Secretary of Energy. For months, the 56-year-old hedge fund manager has been putting his muscle and millions behind a high-profile campaign to build public opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. The offensive may not look like the gesture of an ally—the State Department recently came out with a report that many saw as an endorsement of the project—but if the grassroots protest movement grows and spreads, Steyer believes it could give Obama the cover he needs to reject the pipeline and take a firmer stand on climate issues. “Climate is on the move,” Steyer said in an interview with InsideClimate News. “The political tectonic plates are shifting on this issue. We are going to keep the pressure on for our leaders to do right—especially for the next generation.” Hughes, who now owns majority share of The New Republic, is the digital mastermind who helped Obama get elected in",

    "content": "WASHINGTON—A new report from the U.S. Center for Naval Analyses and the London-based Royal United Services Institute, two of the NATO alliance’s front-line strategy centers, recommends putting more effort into fighting global warming than securing reliable supplies of fossil fuels. The authors call the habitual American fixation on winning energy independence through expanded North American production of oil and natural gas “misguided.” They say the “only sustainable solution” to the problem of energy insecurity is not through more drilling, but through energy efficiency and renewable fuels, like biofuels to replace oil. Despite the steady supplies provided by the current U.S. drilling boom, “the increased domestic production of oil and natural gas is not a panacea for the country’s energy security dilemma,” they say. And in blunt language, they criticize American policymakers and legislators for refusing to accept the “robust” scientific evidence that emissions of carbon dioxide are already causing harmful global warming, and for refusing to take actions that, if taken swiftly, could ward off its worst effects. “Political leaders, including many in the United States, refuse to accept short-term costs to address long-term dangers even though the future costs of responding to disasters after they occur will be far greater,” said their report, published this month. The report, in the works for a year, was released as President Obama prepared to ramp up the administration’s efforts on climate change, and while the State Department was immersed in its review of whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. In a major policy speech on Tuesday, Obama is expected to renew his commitment to regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants, as well as other measures involving renewable energy and green technologies, but not to tip his hand on the Keystone decision. Many in Washington believe that he wants to offer strict controls on power plants, the nation’s leading source of greenhouse gases, as a quid pro quo for approving the controversial pipeline, which is seen by opponents as a contributor to the global warming problem. Keystone’s proponents have described the project as important for energy security. For several years, the view that global warming caused by burning fossil fuels is an overwhelming national security threat has been taking firmer hold in national security circles. In",

    "date": "2013-05-14T12:00:35-04:00",
    "content": "As if the public debate about global warming wasn’t complex enough, a new field in climate research is coming of age, grabbing media attention and spawning seemingly contradictory headlines. The work, called attribution research, doesn’t challenge the scientific consensus that climate change is happening. Instead, it strives to understand the regional effects of global warming by determining whether increased greenhouse gas levels did—or didn’t—cause a particular weather event. But the findings can be confusing. For instance, scientists say that climate change made Hurricane Sandy worse, but that it had nothing to do with historic floods in Thailand. Warming probably didn’t cause this year’s severe winter storm, Nemo, but it may have supercharged it. It caused some droughts, but not others. Adding to the confusion is a trend that worries some experts: People on both sides of the climate divide tend to promote only those attribution studies that support their beliefs. Whether a conscious decision or not, this selective use of research is further polarizing the national conversation on climate change, experts told InsideClimate News. “When a new study comes out, it should be informing our understanding of the topic,” said Gretchen Goldman, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists who studies how research is used to inform policy decisions. “But the reverse is happening. People who have predetermined opinions about climate change are only searching for information that supports their views.” The treatment of two stories published by the Associated Press last month, less than a day apart, illustrates the trend. The first, titled “Global Warming Didn’t Cause Big U.S. Drought,” was about a report by five federal agencies, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which concluded that climate change didn’t cause the",

    "date": "2013-04-23T11:45:25-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Leading environmental groups declared on Monday that the Obama administration’s latest environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline fundamentally violated the nation’s core environmental law, an unmistakable warning that they would sue the State Department if it continued to insist that the pipeline poses no significant environmental risk. As if to bolster their case, the Environmental Protection Agency weighed in as well with its own rebuke, saying that it found “environmental objections” to the State Department’s controversial draft environmental impact statement, issued in March, which it deemed “insufficient.” A public comment period ended on Monday, and these were among the first comments released. Industry groups, in their own comments, broadly endorsed the State Department’s approach, which has been widely seen as offering a green light to Keystone, if not an immediate one. Months more of reviewing by the Obama administration lies ahead. The environmental groups include some of the environmental movement’s most seasoned national litigators—the Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth and nine others. Their 200-page comment said that by assuming that Canadian tar sands crude would be delivered to market by rail or some other means if the pipeline were blocked, the State Department had allowed itself “to avoid a full assessment of the project’s direct, indirect and cumulative impacts including its climate impacts,” as required under the National Environmental Protection Act, or NEPA. “Perhaps the most glaring error,” they said, “is the State Department’s assertion that the tar sands will be developed at the same rate regardless of whether Keystone XL is built … This assumption is flawed and unsupported, is directly contradicted by nearly all sectors including the oil industry itself, and it violates the State Department’s NEPA obligations.” The brief’s extensive references to NEPA case law, its repeated use of terms like “arbitrary and capricious” and its focus on points of regulatory process all amounted to an implicit statement: see you in court. The groups also appeared to open up a new front by demanding that TransCanada, the pipeline company, produce its detailed emergency plans for responding to any spill from the pipeline. They said NEPA requires that these plans, too, face comprehensive and time-consuming review before the State Department could move ahead with the project. Comments from individuals were said by the anti-pipeline group 350.org and other activists to have surpassed a million, a testament to the long campaign mounted by environmentalists to stop the pipeline, which would carry tar sands crude from Canada to refineries on the U.S. gulf coast. Lawyers for the environmental organizations were still tweaking their comments as the sun went down on Earth Day, which by coincidence fell at the close of a 45-day comment period, ending at midnight, that the organizations had complained was far too short. The comments from the EPA and the environmental groups played out on parallel tracks, some dealing with the climate change consequences of producing and burning an unusually dirty fuel. Significantly, the EPA also dwelled at length on the risks of moving that fuel through pipelines and the difficulties of cleaning up any spill. Some environmental advocates said they were elated—if startled—that the EPA weighed in as forcefully as it did. The agency’s comments carry especially significant weight, as it is charged with reviewing the work of other agencies under NEPA. “The EPA has got it exactly right,” said Anthony Swift, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The EPA determined that the Keystone XL would have significant negative environmental impacts.” The EPA’s citation of “environmental objections” means, the agency explained, that it has “identified significant environmental impacts that must be avoided in order to provide adequate protection for the environment. Corrective measures may require substantial changes.” Along with concerns about greenhouse gases and climate change, the EPA asked the State Department to reassess whether rail shipments are a realistic alternative to the pipeline, as the draft impact statement asserted, and whether diluted bitumen, or dilbit, is more dangerous to ship via pipeline and more harmful when it spills than conventional crude. The agency’s objection strengthened the hands of the environmental groups, because it found “significant environmental impacts that must be avoided” and that “may require substantial changes.” The EPA emphasized the cumulative significance of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the fuel that would be shipped via the proposed pipeline—nearly a billion tons of carbon dioxide over five decades. The State Department, reasoning that the oil was going to be shipped with or without the pipeline, had glossed over the importance of these emissions, a drop in the global bucket of carbon dioxide pollution. As it has done before, EPA urged the State Department to put a dollar figure on the societal costs that would have to be paid for global warming in the future, offsetting the economic benefits that proponents often cite. And it called for a discussion of specific steps the provincial government of Alberta, which controls the tar sands deposits, might be called upon to take to avoid such emissions, “including a joint focus on carbon capture and storage projects and research, as well as ways to improve energy efficiency associated with extraction technologies.” The Alberta government filed comments favoring the pipeline, but a provincial spokesman said Alberta would defer to the State Department on when those comments should be released. The State Department has promised to make all the comments public as required by law, reversing its earlier stance, but has not said when it will do so. Shawn Howard, a spokesman for TransCanada, the Alberta-based pipeline operator that has been trying to get the pipeline approved for years, said the company’s comments to the State Department were so voluminous that he could not transmit them to the media on Monday. He said a summary may be released later in the week. A coalition of industry groups led by the American Petroleum Institute filed a 14-page comment affirming the State Department’s findings and urging it to move ahead. “After more than four years of an unprecedentedly thorough review, it is time to move forward beyond the findings of this review, which has been conducted in coordination with dozens of other federal, state and local agencies, and determine that this project is in our nation’s interest,” it said. The environmental groups, in their comment, broadly disputed the pipeline’s supposed benefits, saying they had been exaggerated. Even the State Department analysis, they noted, had acknowledged “that Keystone XL would create few permanent jobs, conceding that it would serve primarily as a means to export tar sands fuel to foreign countries, and failing to even set forth a compelling need for this project.” Some of the most compelling objections, shared to some extent by both the EPA and the environmental groups, were those that first sparked the prairie-fire opposition to the pipeline: fears of a devastating accident, like the",

    "date": "2013-04-05T22:00:16-04:00",
    "content": "Since ExxonMobil’s Pegasus pipeline ruptured and leaked Canadian oil across an Arkansas suburb a week ago, the company has maintained that only “a few thousand barrels” spilled at the site. “We’ve had no reason to change that at this stage,” Exxon spokesman Charles Engelmann told InsideClimate News on Friday. But earlier this week in the corrective action order it issued, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), part of the Department of Transportation, said the spill was 3,500 to 5,000 barrels. Engelmann said Friday that “3,500 to 5,000 is not our number” and suggested that InsideClimate News ask PHMSA where those figures came from. A PHMSA spokeswoman confirmed that the higher figures came from ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (EMPCO). Reports posted online by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimate the spill even higher—at 4,000 to 7,000 barrels—as much as 40 percent more. Austin Vela, the EPA spokesman at the spill site, said the agency stands by its 4,000 to 7,000 barrel estimate. When asked why those higher numbers aren’t being included in the daily press releases issued by the joint command of the cleanup operation, Vela did not respond. The joint command includes five EPA employees as well as ExxonMobil officials. Few, if any, media reports have cited the higher official EPA figure. UPDATE: After this story was published, ExxonMobil updated the joint command incident report for Friday. The report now says that approximately 5,000 barrels of oil spilled in Mayflower. Estimating the size of a spill in the first days after an accident can be contentious, because the volume of the spill affects the fines and penalties companies may eventually pay for violating the Clean Water Act. Fines can be as high as $1,100 for every barrel spilled. If gross negligence or willful misconduct is proven, violators can be forced to pay as much as $4,300 per barrel. If the EPA’s highest number of 7,000 barrels—equivalent to 294,000 gallons—turns out to be correct, the Arkansas spill would be roughly a third the size of a",

    "title": "Upstart Pipeline Company Staking Its Future on Stopping Heavy Oil Corrosion",
    "date": "2013-04-08T08:00:17-04:00",
    "content": "An upstart company in Ohio is aiming to disrupt the oil pipeline business with new technology that resists corrosion far more effectively than conventional pipe. MesoCoat, Inc. says its technology will become especially crucial as global oil production shifts to more sulfurous and heavier fuels like tar sands crude. It claims it can make pipelines safer from potential leaks and save oil companies hundreds of millions of dollars by reducing the frequency of replacing corroded pipes. At just six years old, MesoCoat is already attracting interest from major oil companies and research centers in Alberta, home of Canada’s vast oil sands resources. It has won five R&D 100 awards for innovation, plus an award from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a U.S. agency. In the fall, it took the top spot in The Wall Street Journal’s Technology Innovations Awards for manufacturing. The global attention is helping MesoCoat leap from startup to commercial company. But for Canada’s tar sands industry, the attention appears to be coming at a less-than-opportune time, as it lobbies hard for approval of the Alberta-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline. One of the main objections to the Keystone is the possibility that the tar sands oil it would carry is more corrosive to pipelines than ordinary crudes, with implications for oil spills. That concern deepened last week after an ExxonMobil pipeline carrying bitumen ruptured and leaked at least 200,000 gallons of the tarry crude in an Arkansas neighborhood. Because bitumen is too thick to flow through pipelines, it is blended with natural gas liquids and turned into diluted bitumen, or dilbit. Pipelines that carry dilbit operate at higher pressure and heat than those carrying conventional oil. Environmental and safety groups contend that far too little scientific evaluation has been done to be sure that pipes designed for regular oil are safe for dilbit. “There hasn’t been much in the way of basic science that addresses the question of corrosion,” said Anthony Swift, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) who studies pipeline safety issues. Oil sands companies, and the Alberta and Canadian governments, say dilbit acts similarly to other crude inside a pipeline. In a backgrounder on the topic sent to InsideClimate News, the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, said dilbit is “no more corrosive in pipelines than other heavy crude oils” transported by U.S. pipelines. A recent laboratory study by Natural Resources Canada, a government agency, tested the corrosivity of four types of dilbit—out of the dozens that exist—and seven other heavy oils. It found the dilbit samples to be among the least corrosive. The study didn’t examine how any of the oils respond to higher temperatures. In the United States, a National Academies of Science committee is studying dilbit corrosion and will release its findings this summer. But the committee doesn’t have access to proprietary industry data that is considered the most thorough and will base its report on existing research. Ross Kozarsky, a senior analyst at Lux Research Inc., a research and advisory firm that focuses on emerging technologies, says several dozen startups and university labs are competing with global manufacturing companies in search of technologies to reduce corrosion of metals. So far, MesoCoat is one of the leaders of the upstart pack, he said. Whoever ends up developing the winning technologies could inherit a huge market in the oil industry. According to estimates by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers, a global trade group for the corrosion control industry, repairing or replacing corroded pipes costs oil and gas companies more than $7 billion a year. When the costs of lost productivity and revenues—plus cleanup costs from spills or leaks—are factored in, the figure probably doubles, said Kevin Garrity, the association’s recent past president. Those costs are expected to rise as the global oil market shifts to sour and heavier oils, which have higher sulfur contents and more corrosive properties than lighter, sweeter crudes, according to MesoCoat. At the same time, oil companies are using more intensive extraction techniques that involve salt water and acidic gases, including deep-sea drilling and enhanced recovery. Robert Miller, CEO of Abakan, Inc., which owns a controlling stake in MesoCoat, anticipates strong demand in the future for corrosion-resistant products in long-distance downstream pipelines like the Keystone. Dilbit “is more corrosive than sweet oil,” Miller said in an interview, “although they strongly deny that, of course, in Canada.” For now, MesoCoat is focusing on upstream pipelines—which everyone agrees corrode faster than other oil pipelines. These pipes transport a highly corrosive mix of raw bitumen, sand, hot water, sediments, acidic gases and chemicals from oil sands mines to nearby processing plants. There, the bitumen is separated and diluted with natural gas liquids for transport downstream to U.S. refineries. ‘You Wouldn’t Win a Pipeline Bid Without It’ In",

    "content": "MAYFLOWER, Ark.—Nearly a week after an oil pipeline ruptured in Mayflower, Ark., residents of this community of 2,200 are still overwhelmed by the disaster that has upended their lives. “All of us are in shock,” said David Fox, the pastor of First Baptist Church. “Manmade disasters are so rare in our state … you don’t think this kind of thing can happen to you.” The oil spill, which occurred on Good Friday, cast a pall over the church service Fox held that day, he said. On Easter Sunday, an Exxon contractor showed up at the church to monitor indoor and outdoor air quality. The underground pipeline, owned by ExxonMobil, sent at least 147,000 gallons of heavy Canadian crude oil through the streets of one of the town’s more affluent neighborhoods, forcing the evacuation of 22 homes. A smell that residents describe as “acrid” or “like burning tires” still lingers in the North Woods subdivision.On Wednesday night, Fox’s church hosted a dinner for the evacuated families. Church members brought homemade soups, chili, cornbread and dessert. Throughout the evening, families trickled in and out, eating the food and sharing stories about their experiences after the spill. Several residents told InsideClimate News they were pleased with the way Exxon is footing the bill for their food, lodging and other material needs. But they also said they have many unanswered questions about the health impacts of the oil and how long it would be before their lives could return to normal. Jennifer Tistle, a mother of three who works in retail in Little Rock, said that until the spill she hadn’t even known that an oil pipeline passed through her neighborhood. She learned about the accident on Friday afternoon, when her husband got a text message from a neighbor. The couple rushed home from work. By the time they arrived, however, police had cordoned off their street. The family of five spent the night in a hotel room. The next morning, Mayflower’s police chief escorted them to their home so they could pack some belongings. Tistle said they just ran around grabbing things. “I told the kids, I don’t know if your clothes will match, but you’ll have stuff to wear.” The oil ran through the Tistles’ side yard and part of their backyard. “We’ve never been in a situation like this,” she said. “We don’t even know what questions to ask. “ Tistle said it’s hard to think ahead about the future, about whether they’ll move back into their house or try to sell it. She wants to learn more about the composition of the oil, its health effects and how the spill will impact property values. “It’s just overwhelming,” she said. “My brain is overloaded.” The ExxonMobil pipeline was carrying Wabasca Heavy crude, a type of dilbit made from bitumen mined in Canada’s oil sands region. Because bitumen is too thick to flow through pipelines, it is diluted with natural gas liquids and turned into dilbit, or diluted bitumen. In",

    "date": "2013-04-05T07:00:32-04:00",
    "content": "InsideClimate News reporter Lisa Song was threatened with arrest on Wednesday after she entered the command center for the cleanup operation in Mayflower, Ark., where a major oil pipeline spill occurred on Friday. Song went to the command center in hopes of reaching representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation. She had been told they were working out of the command center, but had been unable to get their names or contact information despite multiple requests to the agencies. Thousands of barrels of oil from Alberta’s tar sands region—similar to the diluted bitumen that would flow through the controversial Keystone XL project—spilled into a residential neighborhood from a pipeline owned by ExxonMobil, forcing the evacuation of 22 homes. Those families are now being housed in hotels at Exxon’s expense. Song had tried to enter the command compound on Tuesday, but was turned away by a security guard. On Wednesday, however, a different guard was on duty and he waved her through the gate. Inside, a second person directed her to the warehouse that houses the command center. Inside the building, Song went to a table with a sign that said “public affairs,” where she was given the name and contact information for Austin Vela, the EPA spokesman at the site. Before she could get the name of a DOT representative, however, Exxon spokeswoman Kim Jordan spotted Song and told her to leave. A second person arrived and said, “You’ve been asked by security to leave. If you don’t you’ll be arrested for criminal trespass.” Song left the compound. InsideClimate News lodged complaints with the EPA and with officials at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), the division of the DOT that regulates interstate pipelines. A PHMSA spokeswoman responded and said the agency has two investigators in Mayflower and no public information officer, and is not responsible for site access. The EPA, which is the designated on-scene coordinator for the investigation in Mayflower, did not respond to questions about whether Song should have been evicted from the command center. Timothy Smith, professor emeritus of journalism at Kent State University and founder of the Media Law Center for Ethics and Access, said that if the command center was on Exxon property and Song had refused to leave, the company could, indeed, have asked local law enforcement officials to arrest her. But Smith said he couldn’t understand why the “DOT and EPA should be hunkered down behind walls thrown up by a private company.” “This type of operating procedure is unusual. I can’t figure out why it would be beneficial to either Exxon or DOT to control information about this event,” Smith said. “While the Arkansas spill is certainly embarrassing given the controversy about the Canadian pipeline, by denying access, they are making it worse.” Song reported on Tuesday that Exxon is controlling the flow of information about the spill. The phone number of the command center goes to an ExxonMobil answering service in Texas, and for almost a week the official daily updates released by the command center contained only three logos: ExxonMobil, the city of Mayflower and Faulkner County, Ark. Vela, the EPA spokesman, said the agency’s logo was omitted by accident. It appeared on Thursday’s update. The area where the spill occurred is also off limits to the media. On Tuesday afternoon, a sheriff’s deputy told Song and two college journalism students to leave when they tried to take pictures at a spot near the incident command site, where some of the oil was being removed. On Wednesday, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that the Federal Aviation Administration has set up a temporary no-fly zone over the spill area, and that “only relief aircraft under direction of Tom Suhrhoff” are allowed in the zone. A LinkedIn profile says Suhrhoff is an aviation advisor at ExxonMobil. About 600 people at the site are working for Exxon and various contractors. The EPA has five employees on site. The ExxonMobil pipeline that ruptured was carrying Wabasca Heavy crude, a type of bitumen mined in Canada’s oil sands region. Because bitumen is too thick to flow through pipelines, it is thinned with natural gas liquids and turned into dilbit, or diluted bitumen. In",

    "content": "A petition filed with federal agencies last week by a coalition led by the National Wildlife Federation is demanding a moratorium on pending tar sands pipelines—including the Keystone XL—until regulators establish new rules to ensure their safety. As if to illustrate the dangers outlined in the petition, Exxon’s Pegasus pipeline that carries Canadian diluted bitumen, or dilbit, on Friday spilled in central Arkansas, releasing an estimated 84,000 gallons of the crude within about 45 minutes before the release was stopped, according to local sources. Filed on behalf of 29 environmental and community groups and 36 individuals, the petition includes a list of nine policy recommendations for the safe transport of dilbit, a type of crude oil produced from Canada’s oil sands region. “Simply put, diluted bitumen and conventional crude oil are not the same substance,” the petitioners wrote. “There is increasing evidence that the transport of diluted bitumen is putting America’s public safety at risk. Current regulations fail to protect the public against those risks. Instead, regulations … treat diluted bitumen and conventional crude the same.” The rules proposed by the petitioners cover pipeline safety, leak prevention and oil spill response, issues InsideClimate News has been covering closely in the wake of the million-gallon dilbit spill in Michigan’s Kalamazoo River that occurred in July",

    "content": "MAYFLOWER, Ark.—A warehouse next to highway I-40 here at the edge of Mayflower, Ark., houses the command center for the ongoing cleanup of thousands of barrels of spilled Canadian heavy oil, but it is inaccessible to media. Tightly controlled by ExxonMobil, which was responsible for the spill, access to even the parking lot is not permitted. A security guard now stops anyone without a red lanyard and ID badge from passing into the gated compound. Thousands of barrels of oil from Alberta’s tar sands region—similar to the crude that would flow through the controversial Keystone XL project—spilled into a suburban Arkansas neighborhood on Friday. A 70-year-old pipeline owned by Exxon that runs from Patoka, Ill. to Nederland, Texas ruptured and forced the evacuation of nearly two dozen homes. The town of 2,000 people is now suddenly the focus of national attention in the divisive debate over whether President Obama should approve the Keystone XL, a $5 billion pipeline to ship Alberta’s heavy crude to U.S. refineries along the Texas coast. The stakes are high and Exxon is running the show here, with federal agencies so far publicly invisible. The phone number of the command center in Mayflower goes to an ExxonMobil answering service based in Texas, and each day it is Exxon that distributes a unified command press release—which contains the logos of Exxon, Faulkner County and the city of Mayflower—with official updates on the progress of the cleanup. As the cleanup operation for the oil spill enters its fifth day, it is still unclear how much oil has spilled. Exxon has said it is reacting as if 420,000 gallons had been spilled, though the EPA’s estimate places the volume at 84,000 gallons so far. Exxon would not reveal what its pipeline monitoring system recorded. These systems, standard in the industry, track the flow of oil from origin to destination, and when a leak occurs, can provide an estimate of the amount of oil that has gone missing into the environment. A spokeswoman said the company is still calculating the amount of oil spilled. A request for a media tour of the spill site today was turned down by an Exxon spokesperson, who emerged from the command center to speak with a reporter at the gate. All areas being cleaned up so far have also been off limits. There is no central location where members of the media can gather to ask questions. Exxon has said 120 company officials are on site, but it is unknown how many federal officials are on site. When InsideClimate News asked to speak with a government official inside the command center, Exxon spokeswoman Kim Jordan came out of the building to answer questions. She confirmed that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)—the federal pipeline regulator—were present. Later, in an email, she said she didn’t have the names and contact information of everyone on site and directed interview requests to the agencies’ public affairs offices. The EPA and PHMSA did not return requests for information. A spokesman from the National Transportation Safety Board said the agency has not launched an investigation into the accident and has delegated responsibility to PHMSA. Jordan said it’s hard to pinpoint who’s in charge of the unified command. “We are the responsible party and we’re in coordination with other agencies,” she said. Speaking with reporters in Washington on Monday, White House spokesperson Jay Carney said, “I haven’t spoken about this incident with the president. We obviously have a system in place where the EPA, in this case, is the federal on-scene coordinator when you have a spill, an event like this and they are working with and have been working with state and local officials as well as the responsible party as they respond to this incident.” The exact cause of the pipeline rupture is still under investigation. Jordan said Exxon is coordinating with the Department of Transportation on a plan to excavate the ruptured pipe. On Saturday, Exxon spokesman Charles Engelmann told InsideClimate News the pipeline was carrying Wabasca Heavy crude when it ruptured. According to multiple petroleum industry sources and reports, Wabasca Heavy is listed as a type of diluted bitumen, or dilbit, from Canada’s oil sands region.

    "content": "Two advocacy groups have come up with a new tactic to show how climate change—and laws to deal with it—could make investments in fossil fuel companies riskier and rock financial markets. In a pair of first-of-their-kind shareholder resolutions, the groups have asked two of the nation’s largest coal producers to report to investors how much of their coal assets would be left “stranded” in the ground if the United States were to pass sweeping greenhouse gas regulations. As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy group for environmental issues, filed a resolution with CONSOL Energy late last year. The Unitarian Universalist Association, a religious organization that promotes social justice, filed a similar resolution with Alpha Natural Resources. The groups’ point is that coal and other energy companies would be dangerously overvalued in a carbon-regulated world, thus creating a “carbon bubble” that could one day pop. “This carbon bubble is so big, it’s going to make the housing bubble look like chump change,” Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, said in an interview. “It’s another order of magnitude.” The carbon bubble concept is relatively new, born out of a recent scientific paper that has united climate change activists and some in the financial community in a common pursuit: to rethink the value of investments in coal, oil and gas.

    "date": "2013-03-12T10:00:56-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—The surprising message of the State Department’s latest Keystone review—that the decision whether to approve the disputed pipeline won’t have much effect on the environment—can be traced to the way the agency framed the report. The study presents an analysis of how markets will adjust if the pipeline isn’t built. But lawyers and pipeline opponents say that approach allowed the State Department to dodge the central question that the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, poses about major federal decisions: What would it mean for the environment, including for climate change, if the project is built? Instead, the report looked at what might happen if the pipeline is rejected and declared that any benefits to the global climate would be trivial. Canadian producers would continue to ship oil sands products to U.S. refineries by other means, such as rail, the report concluded, and greenhouse gas emissions from this unusually dirty oil would continue more or less unabated. That approach “is not in keeping with the letter or the spirit of NEPA,” said Pat Parenteau, an environmental lawyer at the Vermont Law School. “It stands the whole concept of examining the consequences of your actions on its head, it really does.” Calling the State Department’s approach “highly suspect,” “very questionable,” and “very disingenuous,” Parenteau predicted: “There is going to be litigation if this is approved.” The Environmental Protection Agency, which plays an important role in rating the performance of other agencies in performing environmental assessments under NEPA, has repeatedly urged the State Department to focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how to offset them if Keystone were to get the green light. “We are concerned about levels of GHG emissions associated with the proposed project, and whether appropriate mitigation measures to reduce these emissions are being considered,” the EPA said in comments on a previous draft, in",

    "date": "2013-02-21T07:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "The likely nomination of nuclear physicist Ernest Moniz to lead the Department of Energy has drawn criticism from some environmentalists who say his support for natural gas and close ties to industry would undermine efforts to tackle climate change. Moniz strongly favors natural gas as a “bridge fuel” and directs the MIT Energy Initiative, a research program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is funded by some of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies. “His appointment to the DOE could set renewable energy development back years,” said a statement released by Food and Water Watch. The environmental group is circulating a petition opposing Moniz’s nomination. But an examination of Moniz’s public record indicates a more nuanced outlook. Moniz did not return requests for an interview. However, in speeches and reports over the past few years, he has expressed concern for climate change, proposed additional funding for renewable energy and recommended more stringent regulations for natural gas production. He even hinted that he might support a tax on electricity to fund clean energy research. In December, while speaking at the University of Texas at Austin, Moniz warned that while natural gas could reduce carbon emissions by displacing coal-fired electricity, its increasing use could also slow growth in the clean energy sector. “When it comes to carbon, [natural] gas is part of our solution at least for some time,” said Moniz, who served as undersecretary of energy during the Clinton administration. “And we should take advantage of the time to innovate and bring down the cost of renewables. The worst thing w[ould] be is to get time and not use it. And that I’m afraid is where we are.” Moniz’s comments came during a discussion about the impacts of shale gas at the conference, “Comparative Energy: Policies and Technologies in France and the USA.” He spoke on a panel with three industry representatives, a university scientist who studies water resources and a Democrat from the Texas House of Representatives. (Note: InsideClimate News publisher David Sassoon also spoke at the Texas conference, on a panel about energy and media). During his 10-minute presentation, Moniz called the recent boom in shale gas production—made possible by a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking—a “game changer.” Shale gas, he said, has lowered utility bills and created “something on the order of 600,000 jobs…There is no politician in my view who’s going to walk away from this.” But he also addressed the environmental impacts of natural gas drilling. “As a rough general statement I would say all of these [environmental concerns] are manageable, which should not be confused with managing them. And that’s going to be the real challenge,” he said. While the industry has taken “impressive” steps to reduce its environmental footprint, Moniz said it hasn’t done enough. “There have been water issues—not from fracking, but from bad well completion. There have been surface water spills. There clearly has been methane leakage…I would have to say that the natural gas industry…has not exactly been very forward-leaning in terms of coming together in ways that actually propagate best practices by everyone so that in fact these manageable problems are managed by everyone.” Uniform Regulations Needed for Fracking Moniz didn’t propose any policy solutions during the Texas conference. But two years ago, speaking as a witness before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, he told lawmakers that the environmental problems created by fracking “can be mitigated to acceptable levels through appropriate regulation and oversight.” The committee hearing was about a",

    "date": "2013-02-25T10:00:06-05:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—With a couple of lines tucked into his State of the Union speech this month, President Obama pitched the tent for a three-ring circus starring advocates with competing agendas: controlling greenhouse gases, expanding fossil fuel development and conserving open spaces. The idea Obama proposed would siphon $2 billion from the swelling oil and gas royalties the government expects to collect over the next decade and devote it to federally sponsored clean-car research that has been starved for cash. The question is what he will have to give up in negotiations to get what he wants. “Much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together,” he said in the speech. “So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.” The program Obama wants to bolster pays for research into batteries and other technologies that could expand the use of efficient, affordable cars that emit little or no carbon dioxide. Nearly every hybrid electric vehicle sold in the United States uses batteries developed in part through the Energy Department. But like other spending aimed at confronting climate change, the program is anathema to many conservatives. Obama’s sweetener—paying for clean-car research with drilling royalties—immediately attracted praise from those who favor more drilling and see it as an opening to expand drilling to areas where it is currently prohibited. But it has raised the hackles of some land conservationists, who have long fought for more royalty money to flow into the Land and Water Conservation Trust, which they say has been underfunded for years. Like all spending decisions, the amount to be provided for clean energy research and the uses to be made of royalties are matters that only Congress, with its power of the purse, can decide. What this all presages is an intense period of backroom horse-trading among parties who have long mistrusted each other, and who all have as much to lose as to gain. “Obama is setting up the pieces for a game of chess,” said David Friedman, a clean vehicles expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Sam Ori, director of policy for Securing America’s Future Energy, or SAFE, the group that first came up with the funding plan that Obama endorsed, was more blunt: “We believe there has to be something in a program like this for Republicans,” he said. “Otherwise it is not going to go anywhere.” SAFE Supports Drilling in Protected Areas SAFE is a group of leading business executives and retired generals, admirals and diplomats dedicated to maintaining reliable sources of domestic energy and minimizing the nation’s exposure to price disruptions. In his speech, Obama embraced SAFE’s ideas without reservation. “If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we,” Obama said. “Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long.” What the president did not mention is that SAFE’s plan expressly recommends expanding drilling on public lands, even in off-limits areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that he has previously pledged to protect. As envisioned in a detailed report issued in December by SAFE’s leadership council, the Trust would be “seeded with revenues from the development of oil and natural gas in federal lands currently inaccessible to industry due to either Congressional or Administrative action. These areas include: the Pacific, Atlantic, and Eastern Gulf of Mexico planning areas of the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and the",

    "content": "New national science standards that make the teaching of global warming part of the public school curriculum are slated to be released this month, potentially ending an era in which climate skepticism has been allowed to seep into the nation’s classrooms. The Next Generation Science Standards were developed by the National Research Council, the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the nonprofit Achieve and more than two dozen states. The latest draft recommends that educators teach the evidence for man-made climate change starting as early as elementary school and incorporate it into all science classes, ranging from earth science to chemistry. By eighth grade, students should understand that “human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming),” the standards say. They’re “revolutionary,” said Mark McCaffrey, programs and policy director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), a nonprofit that defends evolution and climate education and opposes the teaching of religious views as science. The 26 states that helped write the standards are expected to adopt them. Another 15 or so have indicated they may accept them—meaning climate change instruction could make its way into classrooms in 40-plus states. James Taylor, a senior fellow at the conservative Heartland Institute, which is developing a school curriculum that promotes climate skepticism, said the standards’ stance on climate change is based on “unscientific speculation and hype.” But he also said the group has no plans to fight their adoption by the states. The nation’s largest education publishers are already studying how to incorporate the new standards into their materials. They will likely appear in some of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s materials as early as next year, said Tony Artuso, director of science, technology, engineering and mathematics for the company. The standards are also being fast-tracked at McGraw-Hill. “No one is sitting around waiting for the final standards to start their conversation,” said Jeff Livingston, McGraw-Hill’s senior vice president of education policy. “They’ve been studying the drafts so they can start making changes immediately.” Texas, one of the country’s largest textbook buyers, is among the few states that don’t plan to adopt the science standards anytime soon.

    "content": "2/13/13: This story has been updated to include a statement by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. WASHINGTON—In President Obama’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, the theme of confronting climate change played more a supporting than a starring role. Obama urged Congress “to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science—and to act before it’s too late.” And he said that if a recalcitrant and divided Congress “won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.” But the president made no explicit promise to environmental advocates who had been hoping, since his soaring words on climate at his inauguration, that he would pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions that spew from existing power plants, or perhaps block the Keystone XL pipeline they so abhor. Instead, the speech was another inflection point along the curve of his presidency: an assertion of his willingness to bypass Congress on big issues, but also a reminder that he must juggle competing priorities, including jobs, guns, immigration, health care, spending, taxes and global affairs. In trimming his rhetorical sails, the president was navigating through treacherous political crosswinds—including fierce opposition to his agenda from Congressional Republicans, and equally adamant demands from a green movement marching on Washington this weekend to protest the Keystone XL pipeline. In discussing energy, he emphasized security of supply and the creation of jobs as much as the pure green goals of cutting emissions. And he promised to continue cutting red tape and speeding up new gas and oil permits as “part of an all of the above plan.” On balance, many who follow climate issues closely said they were satisfied. Bill Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project, which studies how the White House can act without new legislation, was pleased to hear Obama pledge to do so. “I have the sense that he understands that he might be, and quite likely is, the last president who can keep us from going off the climate cliff,” Becker said. But organizers of Sunday’s Keystone pipeline protest were less enthusiastic. On Twitter, Bill McKibben, whose 350.org group is helping to organize the march, wrote: “I’m interested in what the president says. I’m more interested in what the climate movement can push/free him to do.” For days, the capital had buzzed with rumors that the president might explicitly declare that he would control the carbon dioxide emissions of existing electric plants that burn fossil fuels, using a provision of the Clean Air Act that had lain untouched for so long that one Washington wag calls it “the 40-year-old virgin.” At stake is some 40 percent of all the nation’s emissions, especially from the burning of coal. Although he didn’t mention power plant emissions, many expect that such a regulation is on the way. Its advocates were quick to connect the dots. Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a statement saying that the Clean Air Act already allows Obama to crack down on emissions “from our dirtiest power plants, the single greatest threat to our climate future. That will take presidential leadership. Americans are counting on it—and that’s what the president delivered tonight.” The most specific proposals the president offered were of the kind that are easy to announce, and just as easy to forget. He proposed using some oil and gas revenues “to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.” He also called for federal assistance to states with the best ideas for reducing energy waste in homes and businesses. Obama can already claim to have made progress in curbing emissions through a combination of policy, market upheaval and serendipity: regulations, incentives, recession, and the natural gas drilling revolution. “Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America,” he said. “So let’s generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year – so let’s drive costs down even further.” According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, renewable energy installations hit an all time high last year, natural gas equaled coal as a fuel for generating electricity, energy efficiency continued to improve, and emissions from the energy sector were headed toward their lowest level since",

    "content": "As many as 40,000 protesters from 30 states descended on the White House on Sunday and demanded that President Obama kill the proposed Keystone XL oil sands pipeline. By the estimates of organizers, it was the biggest protest march for climate change action in the nation’s history. In about 18 cities from Boston to Los Angeles, thousands more participated in solidarity rallies—and helped garner unusual nationwide media attention for an issue that has typically slipped under the local media radar. National environmental activists have made the Keystone XL a test of Obama’s climate promises, as well as the cornerstone issue of a mushrooming grassroots movement to turn climate action into a moral issue. The pipeline would carry crude from the Canadian tar sands to Texas refineries and deepen U.S. dependence on a form of oil that produces more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil. The movement is emerging as the biggest environmental protest effort in decades. In recent weeks, protests have sprung up across the country for the first time to stop oil sands import pipelines on climate grounds. Last week, 50 people were arrested at the White House in civil disobedience over the Keystone XL. Sunday’s event, led by advocacy groups 350.org and Sierra Club, was the third and largest pipeline demonstration at the White House in 18 months. A decision by the Obama administration on the Keystone XL is expected later this year. Here’s a roundup of “Forward on Climate” coverage from around the country: Washington D.C.

    "content": "The average “energy returned on investment,” or EROI, for conventional oil is roughly 25:1. In other words, 25 units of oil-based energy are obtained for every one unit of other energy that is invested to extract it. But tar sands oil is in a category all its own. Tar sands retrieved by surface mining has an EROI of only about 5:1, according to research released Tuesday. Tar sands retrieved from deeper beneath the earth, through steam injection, fares even worse, with a maximum average ratio of just 2.9 to 1. That means one unit of natural gas is needed to create less than three units of oil-based energy. “They have to use a lot of natural gas to upgrade this heavy, sticky, gooky almost tar-like stuff to make it fluid enough to use,” said Charles Hall, a professor at the State University of New York’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Hydrogen from gas heats the tar sands so the viscous form of petroleum it contains, known as bitumen, can be liquefied and pumped out of the ground. In this way, Hall said, gas helps turn tar sands “into something a bit closer to what we call oil.” With most of the world’s highest quality resources already exhausted, companies are turning to formerly undesirable alternatives such as tar sands oil, which come with higher energetic price tags yet lower returns. “We built our nation, economy and civilization on cheap energy—that’s where this incredible growth of the U.S. economy has come from,” said Hall, who coined the term EROI in",

    "content": "2/5/13: This story has been updated to include information from PHMSA received after publication. Oil and gas pipelines could be made safer if pipeline operators had clear guidelines for how quickly they must respond to accidents—but federal regulators don’t have the data they need to establish those rules, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent arm of Congress. The first few minutes and hours after a pipeline accident are considered crucial for effective cleanup and damage prevention. But the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which regulates the nation’s 400,000-mile network of large volume transmission pipelines, requires only that operators respond in a “prompt and effective” manner. The GAO urged the agency to replace this open-ended regulation with performance-based standards—specific, measurable goals that would make it easier to determine when operators have been negligent. To do that, PHMSA would have to set different rules for different types of pipelines depending on their contents, location, operating pressure, pipeline diameter and other factors. Matthew Cook, a GAO senior analyst and a co-author of the report, said that to create those rules, PHMSA must first determine how fast operators are currently responding to accidents. But the GAO report warned that PHMSA’s existing database, where pipeline accident information is filed, is incomplete and often inaccurate. For instance, PHMSA requires operators to report the time the incident happened, but not when they first became aware of it or when they arrived on scene (that section of the report is considered optional). And although operators are required to update PHMSA as more facts become available, companies continue to submit inaccurate data. In",

One of the biggest unknowns in the unfolding Keystone XL debate is the role the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency might play. Because the Canada-to-Nebraska oil pipeline crosses an international border, the State Department, not the EPA, will decide whether to give the project the federal permit it needs. But the EPA will weigh in during the review, and its opinion will carry new weight now that the Obama administration has vowed to make climate change a national priority. The EPA’s position will become clearer when the State Department releases its Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the project, which it is expected to do any day now. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to review and comment publicly on the SEIS, and the agency has not been shy about criticizing earlier drafts. “The EPA actually could assert a fair amount of power depending on, basically, how much they want to stick their necks out,” said Jim Murphy, senior counsel at the National Wildlife Federation, which opposes the pipeline. “The level of scrutiny this is going to get is pretty intense.

Protests are springing up from Maine to Washington, D.C. to Oklahoma urging leaders to stop the Keystone XL and other oil sands import projects on climate change grounds. The Texas-bound Keystone XL is the biggest of many projects being proposed to connect Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refineries and export ports. Protesters claim the pipelines would commit the United States and other countries to a form of heavy oil that would worsen global warming. On Jan. 26, some 1,400 people marched through Portland, Maine, against possible plans to move oil from Canada’s tar sands mines to local ports. Days earlier, hundreds of people joined solidarity rallies across New England and in Canada, where they picketed outside gas stations, locked arms along bridges and hoisted signs that read “Tar Sands = Game Over for Climate.” On Monday, indigenous rights activists In Texas and Oklahoma filled public squares to show support for efforts by Canada’s First Nations to block oil sands growth. “We’re trying to build the social movement” against expansion of tar sands oil extraction, said Sophie Robinson, who organized events last week through the Massachusetts chapter of 350.org, a grassroots organization that focuses on climate change. Robinson said she plans to send seven busloads of Boston area activists to the next big anti-Keystone XL rally in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 17. The event called Forward on Climate could be the largest climate protest in U.S. history, organizers say.

    "content": "The news last week that the New York Times is dismantling its environment desk and reassigning the reporters throughout the newsroom provoked an outpouring of reaction, much of it suggesting that now isn’t the time to take risks that could diminish the coverage of climate change. In October, Hurricane Sandy brought home the reality of climate dangers to many Americans, and a recently released draft of the government’s latest climate assessment predicts far worse to come. Temperatures could rise by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit by mid-century, threatening “Americans’ health and livelihoods and the ecosystems that sustain us,” said the report, which was prepared by 240 scientists. Climate change “is not just the biggest crisis ever, it’s the biggest story ever,” said Bill McKibben, founder of the climate advocacy organization 350.org and one of several journalists and climate experts contacted by InsideClimate News. Michael Mann, a climatologist who directs the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said specialized, experienced environment editors and reporters are essential to navigate the escalating politics and complicated science of climate change. “Without properly trained science journalists to serve as honest brokers … the public is increasingly ill-equipped to sift through the cacophony of anti-scientific propaganda that pervades the public discourse and to identify the emerging threats to our health and our environment,” Mann said. With two editors and seven reporters dedicated exclusively to environmental coverage, the Times has long been home to the single largest environment staff of any daily U.S. newspaper. Its coverage has become even more important in recent years, because many struggling papers have slashed their reporting staffs, often relying on the Times as inspiration for the stories they do cover. If the Times’ coverage falters, more pressure would be placed on other national media—including the Associated Press and National Public Radio—to fill the gap, as well as Bloomberg and Reuters, which report on climate primarily for financial audiences, and environmental magazines and specialized websites. Once the Times’ environmental desk is dismantled, the nation’s top five newspapers by readership—the Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and the Wall Street Journal—will have about a dozen reporters and a handful of editors among them whose primary responsibility is to cover the environment. The New York Times has yet to reassign its reporters so a precise tally is not possible. The Los Angeles Times will be the only one among the five to have a designated environment desk.

    "date": "2013-01-23T13:00:19-05:00",
    "content": "For the past decade, the people of Boulder, Colo., have pursued an elusive goal: getting more clean energy into their grid. To do so, they pushed and prodded utility company Xcel Energy to give them a say in electricity decisions. But nothing satisfied citizens and politicians, so several years ago they organized themselves into a movement for “municipalization,” in which the city would split from Xcel and become its own utility. In April, the City Council is expected to vote in favor of pursuing the controversial idea, putting coal-heavy Boulder on the vanguard of efforts to break the monopoly of corporate utility companies. “Somebody has to stick their neck out and try this,” said Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum, who believes Boulder will inspire other cities. Already, residents in Minneapolis are preparing a ballot measure by November for municipalization, and advocates in Santa Fe, N.M., are not far behind. Under municipalization, cities take over utilities’ local electricity operations. They buy the wires, substations and meters, run the electrical grid and select which power plants will supply their power. Most Americans get electricity from mainly fossil fuel-generating plants, usually owned by large utilities. Breaking away theoretically gives cities freedom to add as much clean energy as is technically and financially possible. While some 2,000 municipal utilities exist across the United States, only half a dozen were formed in recent years. Boulder’s would be the first established to increase clean energy and combat climate pollution. Xcel, which operates in eight states and opposes municipalization, denies it’s blocking clean energy development in Boulder. The firm is on track to meet an aggressive state requirement that utilities get 30 percent of their energy from renewables by",

    "content": "After years of protests and lobbying, the Obama administration is expected to decide within months on the fate of the 1,200-mile Keystone XL oil pipeline. The State Department is finalizing a supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) for the project, which would ship tar sands oil from Canada, through America’s heartland, and to the Gulf Coast via other pipelines. The agency will use the SEIS—expected any day now—to help determine whether the project is in the “national interest,” a term that includes economic, energy security and climate change considerations. Due to the pipeline’s high profile, President Obama will play an important role in the decision. Uncertainty and rumors are rife, partly because Hurricane Sandy reignited concern about human-caused climate change and fossil fuels, but largely because the two top officials who bear main responsibility for the decision will soon be replaced. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson will step down this month. Obama has already nominated Democrat John Kerry to head the State Department, which has authority over cross-border pipelines. The selection of the five-term Massachusetts senator, one of the nation’s most vocal proponents of climate action, has heartened opponents of the Keystone XL, who argue the pipeline would exacerbate global warming. The project would carry a kind of oil that emits about 20 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil through the stages of extraction, production and usage.

    "date": "2012-12-17T12:59:27-05:00",
    "content": "Greenpeace usually makes its headlines for high-profile stunts—storming oil rigs, scaling coal plants or forming human shields. But in recent months, the environmental group has been grabbing attention for something more typical of faith-based charities and government agencies: disaster relief. A day after superstorm Sandy ravaged the East Coast, Greenpeace activists drove a solar truck into Queens, New York, emblazoned with the words “Coal Free Future.” They parked it there for more than a month, charged cell phones and a pop-up medical clinic and warmed food for thousands of storm victims. The group arrived in the area, one of the hardest in New York City, days before the Red Cross or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to reports. It’s now assisting in the reconstruction. “When a disaster happens, it is a no-brainer to get involved if we can,” Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace, said. While big relief agencies and governments provide the heavy lifting for disaster relief—supported by corporatations, local businesses and volunteers—the new role being played by activists like Greenpeace is noteworthy for the ground it breaks. In the past, Greenpeace would ferry supplies to tsunami-ravaged communities and send climbers on search-and-rescue missions in earthquake zones. But it didn’t publicize the work. “We never wanted to grandstand our involvement,” Davies said. Now it’s becoming more vocal. “We saw a bizarre alignment of the election and the storm [Sandy], and the possibility that it could drive climate back onto the national agenda,” Davies said. “We want people to clearly understand the connection between Sandy and climate change.” As the number of climate-related disasters increases, Greenpeace is planning to plow more resources into climate disaster relief and make it a more permanent part of its mission, both for humanitarian purposes and to raise awareness on global warming. It isn’t alone. Although their reasons may vary, environmental groups like the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council—which typically fight environmental threats through lawsuits and lobbying—became part-time relief agencies in the wake of Sandy and plan to continue this work. “This is going to become a key part of us now,” said Jeff Tittel, chair of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, which organized shelter for displaced people and clean-up efforts in Sandy’s aftermath. “We are very tied to our members. The more they, their families and friends are impacted, the more obvious it is we have to help.” What these groups contribute is still a tiny fraction of what’s needed, especially in a disaster the size of Sandy, which is expected to cost the region $50 billion. Expected to Get Worse The number of natural disasters has more than doubled in the past 30 years, leaving traditional humanitarian aid agencies financially and logistically overwhelmed. According to Oxfam, a UK-based relief and development organization, humanitarian aid groups are already short of money—as much as $100 billion a year—to cope with the increased frequency and ferocity of events like floods, droughts and hurricanes. The situation is expected to get worse in the coming years. Oxfam predicts that by",

    "title": "EPA Lets Energy Firms Pollute America’s Underground Water Supply",
    "date": "2012-12-11T18:00:51-05:00",
    "content": "A primary concern about the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is that a leak would contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, one of the nation’s most important sources of drinking and irrigation water. InsideClimate News is republishing this investigative story from ProPublica because it highlights another risk to U.S. aquifers: The EPA is allowing some of them to be used as dumping grounds. Federal officials have given energy and mining companies permission to pollute aquifers in more than 1,500 places across the country, releasing toxic material into underground reservoirs that help supply more than half of the nation’s drinking water. In many cases, the Environmental Protection Agency has granted these so-called aquifer exemptions in Western states now stricken by drought and increasingly desperate for water. EPA records show that portions of at least 100 drinking water aquifers have been written off because exemptions have allowed them to be used as dumping grounds. “You are sacrificing these aquifers,” said Mark Williams, a hydrologist at the University of Colorado and a member of a National Science Foundation team studying the effects of energy development on the environment. “By definition, you are putting pollution into them. … If you are looking 50 to 100 years down the road, this is not a good way to go.” As part of an investigation into the threat to water supplies from underground injection of waste, ProPublica set out to identify which aquifers have been polluted. We found the EPA has not even kept track of exactly how many exemptions it has issued, where they are, or whom they might affect. What records the agency was able to supply under the Freedom of Information Act show that exemptions are often issued in apparent conflict with the EPA’s mandate to protect waters that may be used for drinking. Though hundreds of exemptions are for lower-quality water of questionable use, many allow grantees to contaminate water so pure it would barely need filtration, or that is treatable using modern technology. The EPA is only supposed to issue exemptions if aquifers are too remote, too dirty, or too deep to supply affordable drinking water. Applicants must persuade the government that the water is not being used as drinking water and that it never will be. Sometimes, however, the agency has issued permits for portions of reservoirs that are in use, assuming contaminants will stay within the finite area exempted. In Wyoming, people are drawing on the same water source for drinking, irrigation and livestock that, about a mile away, is being fouled with federal permission. In Texas, EPA officials are evaluating an exemption for a uranium mine — already approved by the state — even though numerous homes draw water from just outside the underground boundaries outlined in the mining company’s application. The EPA declined repeated requests for interviews for this story, but sent a written response saying exemptions have been issued responsibly, under a process that ensures contaminants remain confined. “Aquifer Exemptions identify those waters that do not currently serve as a source of drinking water and will not serve as a source of drinking water in the future and, thus, do not need to be protected,” an EPA spokesperson wrote in an email statement. “The process of exempting aquifers includes steps that minimize the possibility that future drinking water supplies are endangered.” Yet EPA officials say the agency has quietly assembled an unofficial internal task force to re-evaluate its aquifer exemption policies. The agency’s spokesperson declined to give details on the group’s work, but insiders say it is attempting to inventory exemptions and to determine whether aquifers should go unprotected in the future, with the value of water rising along with demand for exemptions closer to areas where people live. Advances in geological sciences have deepened regulators’ concerns about exemptions, challenging the notion that waste injected underground will stay inside the tightly drawn boundaries of the exempted areas. “What they don’t often consider is whether that waste will flow outside that zone of influence over time, and there is no doubt that it will,” said Mike Wireman, a senior hydrologist with the EPA who has worked with the World Bank on global water supply issues. “Over decades, that water could discharge into a stream. It could seep into a well. If you are a rancher out there and you want to put a well in, it’s difficult to find out if there is an exempted aquifer underneath your property.” Aquifer exemptions are a little-known aspect of the government’s Underground Injection Control program, which is designed to protect water supplies from the underground disposal of waste. The Safe Drinking Water Act explicitly prohibits injection into a source of drinking water, and requires precautions to ensure that oil and gas and disposal wells that run through them are carefully engineered not to leak. Areas covered by exemptions are stripped of some of these protections, however. Waste can be discarded into them freely, and wells that run through them need not meet all standards used to prevent pollution. In many cases, no water monitoring or long-term study is required. The recent surge in domestic drilling and rush for uranium has brought a spike in exemption applications, as well as political pressure not to block or delay them, EPA officials told ProPublica. “The energy policy in the U.S is keeping this from happening because right now nobody — nobody — wants to interfere with the development of oil and gas or uranium,” said a senior EPA employee who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. “The political pressure is huge not to slow that down.” Many of the exemption permits, records show, have been issued in regions where water is needed most and where intense political debates are underway to decide how to fairly allocate limited water resources. In drought-stricken Texas, communities are looking to treat brackish aquifers beneath the surface because they have run out of better options and several cities, including San Antonio and El Paso, are considering whether to build new desalinization plants for as much as $100 million apiece. And yet environmental officials have granted more than 50 exemptions for waste disposal and uranium mining in Texas, records show. The most recent was issued in September. The Texas Railroad Commission, the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling, said it issued additional exemptions, covering large swaths of aquifers underlying the state, when it brought its rules into compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act in",

    "content": "Activists who had hoped to block the southern leg of the Keystone XL in Texas by occupying trees in the pipeline’s path are ending their three-month protest after construction was rerouted around them. TransCanada, the pipeline’s builder, acquired an easement in October to build the pipeline slightly west of the tree blockade and the original route. Construction is now nearly finished on the property, and the protesters will soon call it quits. “It’s a sad time at the tree blockade,” said Ron Seifert, a spokesperson for the Tar Sands Blockade, the activist group behind the campaign. Seifert said it’s probably days before the tree village decamps, though no official decision has been made. “We’ll take it day by day.” Since late September, dozens of people have been living in 80-foot tree houses or camping below on a piece of property the size of one and a half football fields in Winnsboro, East Texas. The blockade and related protests across Texas have resulted in 50-some arrests and several legal disputes since construction began on the Keystone XL, designed to carry oil from Cushing, Okla. to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. The pipeline would eventually transport heavy diluted bitumen, or dilbit, from the oil sands of Canada. Roughly one-quarter of the 485-mile pipeline is installed, TransCanada spokesperson David Dodson told InsideClimate News. Protesters’ chief complaint is that a spill on the Keystone XL would ravage farmland, irrigation systems, waterways and other fragile ecosystems. They also fear that refining the heavy oil the pipeline would carry would increase global warming and air pollution. In recent weeks, construction near the encampment stopped, giving activists temporary hope, Seifert told InsideClimate News. “As we speak, the pipeline is being trenched around the western end of the blockaded area,” he added with disappointment. The “blockade will essentially become symbolic and come to an end.” Dodson of TransCanada confirmed that construction is “substantially complete” on the property, which is owned by David Daniel, a longtime opponent of the Keystone XL. Daniel reached an easement agreement with TransCanada in",

    "date": "2012-11-29T13:00:51-05:00",
    "content": "A lawsuit against pipeline company Enbridge Inc. was returned to Michigan state court on Tuesday, after a judge ruled that a group that is trying to stop work on the company’s 210-mile pipeline replacement project could not pursue the case in federal court. The ruling didn’t address the merits of the case. POLAR (Protect Our Land And Rights), the nonprofit group that filed the suit, is seeking an injunction against Enbridge, claiming the Canadian company hasn’t obtained all the necessary state and local permits. “We want Enbridge to follow the existing laws,” said POLAR founder Jeff Axt, who owns property along the route. “These aren’t obstructions recently created to stop a pipeline. These are existing laws, regulations and ordinances that have been on township books for years, that need to be complied with before the project proceeds.” Enbridge spokesman Larry Springer said the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation: “Once we’re back in state court…we’ll be prepared to proceed there.” At a Nov. 7 hearing, Enbridge had questioned POLAR’s legal standing in the case and asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. The company argued that POLAR couldn’t seek an injunction because, among other reasons, it’s not one of the government agencies affected by pipeline construction. Federal Judge Robert H. Cleland agreed with that argument in his ruling on Tuesday. But instead of dismissing the case, he remanded it to state court. Axt said the decision gives POLAR a second chance to present its case. “He could have just dismissed this, and everything would just go away. What he did was remand it back to state court…so that’s a victory.” Gary Field, a lawyer representing POLAR, expects Enbridge to challenge POLAR’s legal standing in state court as well. “Enbridge, I think, has a strategy of trying to delay and string things out and diminish POLAR’s resources, which I think they’re somewhat adept at doing.” Enbridge didn’t challenge the merits of the case, he said. “They didn’t say they had the permits. They just said these guys [POLAR] can’t ask us if we have the permits or not.” Field believes it will be easier to defend POLAR’s legal standing in state court, due to differences in state and federal court standards. Tuesday’s ruling means “we’re still alive to continue this endeavor,” he said. The 6B pipeline would run through Michigan and Indiana and carry crude oil from Canada, including tar sands oil, or bitumen. It will replace an existing pipeline that ruptured in",

    "content": "For years, the controversy over natural gas drilling has focused on the water and air quality problems linked to hydraulic fracturing, the process where chemicals are blasted deep underground to release tightly bound natural gas deposits. But a new study reports that a set of chemicals called non-methane hydrocarbons, or NMHCs, is found in the air near drilling sites even when fracking isn’t in progress. According to a peer-reviewed study in the journal Human and Ecological Risk Assessment, more than 50 NMHCs were found near gas wells in rural Colorado, including 35 that affect the brain and nervous system. Some were detected at levels high enough to potentially harm children who are exposed to them before birth. The authors say the source of the chemicals is likely a mix of the raw gas that is vented from the wells and emissions from industrial equipment used during the gas production process. The paper cites two other recent studies on NMHCs near gas drilling sites in Colorado. But the new study was conducted over a longer period of time and tested for more chemicals than those studies did. “To our knowledge, no study of this kind has been published to date,” the authors wrote. The researchers took weekly air samples at a site that’s within one mile of 130 gas wells in Garfield County, Colo., with little other industry aside from natural gas production. They detected more than 50 chemicals between July",

    "title": "Spreading Like Wildfire, Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign Striking a Moral Chord",
    "date": "2012-12-06T15:30:40-05:00",
    "content": "A divestment campaign aimed at fossil fuel companies has swept college campuses across the country since it began just four weeks ago, catching university presidents by surprise. The effort is the result of a student-led campaign coordinated by 350.org, a climate advocacy organization founded by author and activist Bill McKibben. The goal is to turn global warming action into the moral issue of this generation. “Bottom line, for a college or university, you do not want your institution to be on the wrong side of this issue,” said Stephen Mulkey, president of Unity College in Maine. Unity became the first college to authorize divestment using 350.org’s guidelines last month. “We realized that investing in fossil fuels was an unethical position, especially considering our focus on environmental issues,” Mulkey said. Since then, students at dozens of other universities have sat down with senior administrators and boards of trustees to lobby them to sell holdings in coal, oil and gas companies. Divestment campaigns are now underway at 153 colleges and universities, large and small from coast to coast. The organizers expect to reach 200 after the winter break. “We’ve been totally blown away by how fast it’s spread,” said Jamie Henn, a spokesperson with 350.org. The divestiture campaign is the action piece of 350.org’s Do the Math tour, which seeks to mobilize millions of climate activists by laying out the carbon math of business as usual. According to scientific data culled by the group, the world can release just 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. Any hotter than that and climate change could pose a dangerous threat to the planet and human survival. The problem, 350.org says, is that fossil fuel companies have another 2,795 gigatons in their reserves that they want to burn. On 350.org’s divestment website, student activists can download a campaign toolkit including sample petitions, scientific data and a list of the 200 fossil fuel companies being targeted by the group. Most universities already have aggressive climate action plans to cut their carbon footprints. And more than 650 college and university presidents have signed on to the Presidents’ Climate Commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. To sway administrators, students come armed with scientific reports and divestment proposals—and the argument that taking a financial stand against global warming is the next logical step in the school’s climate efforts. Among other happenings, Syracuse University told students it would consider divestment of its $940 million endowment. At Tufts University, which has endowment assets of $1.45 billion, students met with the school’s executive vice president and are planning to submit a proposal for divestment to the board of trustees later this week and meet with the board early next semester. At least one big-city mayor, Mike McGinn of Seattle, said he planned to investigate how the city could divest its pension-fund holdings. Currently, $17.6 million of Seattle’s $1.9 billion pension fund is invested in ExxonMobil and Chevron. Vermont, McKibben’s home state, is expected to consider legislation fueled by the student campaign. John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry’s main trade group, told InsideClimate News that targeting stable and profitable investments in coal, oil and gas could backfire. “Students haven’t thought this through,” Felmy said. “If you suddenly divest yourself of good performing assets, the only people you’re harming are students that rely on scholarships.” Chris Davis, director of investor programs at Ceres, a coalition of large investors and environmental groups, said it would be wonderful if divestment raises the profile of climate change among lawmakers in Washington. But he’s also wary of the risks. “Oil, gas and coal power our economics right now,” he told InsideClimate News. “The people in charge of endowments have a fiduciary responsibility to the people relying on the funds—people that need salaries and scholarships. Pulling completely away from fossil fuel investments right now is risky.” The leaders of the divestiture campaign are thinking long term. The campaign thrusts the climate issue in front of “some of the most influential people in this country,” said Henn of 350.org—people who sit on the boards of America’s colleges and universities, which hold about $400 billion in endowment assets. It also engages a key constituency—students. Fossil fuel companies may be able to lobby Washington policymakers, but “they can’t be on every campus at every moment influencing students like this campaign is,” Henn said, adding that the",

    "content": "Phoenix, Arizona—From a block away, the house was hardly visible, hidden by a dense stand of native mesquite and palo verde trees and tall clumps of prickly pear cactus. Close up, you could see the concrete block structure, built a half century ago when acres of citrus groves were broken into parcels and replaced by homes. Turning the site back into desert took some work, Brock Tunnicliff explained, standing outside his house on a typical September morning in the Sonoran desert, temperatures in the mid-80s under a nearly cloudless sky. It also took some courage, because desert landscaping isn’t popular in Phoenix. Most people here still prefer a lawn out front and a swimming pool in the back. For Tunnicliff, who works in natural resource management, adopting native landscape was a logical choice in a desert climate. Bolted to his roof was another rational choice: a solar photovoltaic system that supplies most of his family’s electricity needs. He installed the system even though he estimates it will take 12 years to break even on the investment. “That is the future of energy,” he said, pointing to the dark blue panels on his roof. How far in the future is anyone’s guess, however. Four years after Tunnicliff installed the system, a satellite image reveals no other solar panels in his neighborhood. In America’s sunniest and driest big city, swimming pools still outnumber solar panels by a thousand to one. In fact, Germany—which receives only half as much sunlight as Arizona—has four times as much solar power installed per capita as the Grand Canyon state. Compared nation-to-nation, Germany’s advantage is even more lopsided: This darker, cloudier central European country has 23 times more solar power per capita than the United States.

    "title": "Election Outcome Changes the Climate and Energy Conversation in Congress",
    "date": "2012-11-27T09:00:16-05:00",
    "content": "Statistically, the November elections seemed a win for the status quo in Washington—neither chamber of Congress nor the White House switched parties, and the gridlock that has plagued the 112th Congress seems destined to continue through the 113th. But some of the nation’s leading environmental groups say a closer examination of the winners and losers shows the situation isn’t as static as it seems, at least when it comes to climate and energy issues. More than a third of the 95 newcomers to the House and Senate are Democrats who are expected to support environmental issues. And a campaign to defeat candidates who oppose clean energy and conservation legislation ousted some longtime opponents. “We’re incredibly enthused about the results,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters. “The candidates who stood by clean energy were overwhelmingly elected or re-elected. … A lot of the worst of the worst, the people who said the most egregious things and were the biggest allies of oil, lost. “These elections showed that being a climate change denier isn’t just bad policy, but now it’s bad politics.” The so-called status quo is now “in numbers only,” said Nathan Hultman, a Brookings Institution fellow and professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “There has been a long-standing commitment from Obama’s White House to deal with climate change and clean energy,” Hultman said. “Where we have some potential for change is in the Congressional debates.” The League of Conservation Voters led a campaign that targeted 12 state and national candidates with a history of voting against clean energy and conservation. Eleven of the so-called “dirty dozen,” led by GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, were defeated, including Reps. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., and Joe Walsh, R-Ill., and Democratic Rep. Tim Holden of Pennsylvania. Rep. Dan Benishek, R-Mich., was the only survivor on the League’s target list, which focused on races where the group was most likely to be successful. Four of the defeated politicians, as well as Benishek, were also on the League’s “flat earth five” list of climate deniers. Among those who lost was Rep. Francisco Canseco, a Texas Republican who had fought EPA regulations he said were “based on reportedly manufactured global warming data.” Nick Loris, an energy economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, said environmental groups still face an uphill battle. He said the overarching debate about the size of government, coupled with the enormity of the country’s economic problems, will overshadow any climate and energy legislation. There is “still a large contingency in Congress that is opposed to their agenda,” Loris said. “Honestly, I don’t see a lot in Congress getting done for either side.” But Josh Saks, legislative director for the National Wildlife Federation, said the changes will at least open the door for more discussion. “Regardless of the issue, people are frustrated with the inability to move forward on the Hill,” he said. “I think that members will find a way to be more productive, and addressing climate change and getting clean water should be high on the list.” Saks and Sittenfeld say that while a carbon regulation bill is still highly unlikely to pass, some smaller clean energy bills might move, including several that would salvage clean energy tax credits that are set to expire. A number of larger bills with environmental components could also see an easier path. Congress is expected to work on a wide-ranging Water Resources Development Act that would address some clean water issues, like continuing the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that offers loans that help states deal with water pollution. The Farm Bill, which fizzled this summer, is expected to be introduced again with conservation issues attached, including programs to protect wetlands and grasslands near agricultural areas and the Chesapeake watershed. Smoothing Negotiations The League of Conservation Voters compiled an “environmental facebook” of 41 new members—34 in the House and seven in the Senate—who have a history of supporting clean energy efforts in the business or public sectors. Among them are Democrats Sen. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Rep. John Delaney (Md.) and Rep. Pete Gallago (Texas). Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent, will caucus with Democrats. Sittenfeld pointed to the Montana senate race, where GOP Rep. Denny Rehberg lost to incumbent Democrat Jon Tester, as a sign that voters were prioritizing clean energy. Over six terms, Rehberg has a lifetime 6 percent score on the League’s national environmental scorecard, which measures how members have voted on environmental legislation. Tester, meanwhile, notched an 87 percent rating. Similarly, Rep. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat with a 95 percent score, ousted former Rep. Heather Wilson (15 percent over five terms) in the race for New Mexico’s open senate seat. In the Massachusetts senate race, Republican incumbent Scott Brown lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren, whom Sittenfeld predicts will be “a true environmental champion.” Hultman, with the Brookings Institution, said the new advocates on the Hill could help clear the way for climate or carbon initiatives to be included in the broader fiscal discussions that are likely to dominate Congress in the first part of",

    "date": "2012-11-28T12:30:41-05:00",
    "content": "When climate scientists try to estimate how much the Earth will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, a key consideration is the role of plants and soils. The more carbon they absorb, the more they reduce the global warming potential. But recent studies indicate that assumptions about plants’ and soils’ capacity in the so-called “carbon cycle” may be overly optimistic. If these studies are correct, even bigger cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will be needed to prevent drastic, irreparable climate shifts. Not only is it possible that plants won’t be able to absorb as much carbon as climate models currently project, but plants’ response to the carbon cycle could actually amplify global warming, Paul Higgins and John Harte write in the November edition of the Journal of Climate. It all comes down to mobility. Carbon dioxide is recognized as critical for photosynthesis, so the more there is in the atmosphere, the more there is available for plant growth. As Earth’s climate warms, the theory has been that trees and other plant communities would treat the added CO2 as fertilizer and grow bigger and faster. But because climate conditions will be changing, to take advantage of the added CO2 some plant communities will have to migrate to neighboring areas that provide the necessary growing conditions. The speed at which plants can make these moves is the question. Higgins, associate director of the American Meteorological Society’s Policy Program, said it has been very difficult to build global ecosystem models that are sensitive to the limitations of plant migration. “If you look at the … models, they had no real constraints on plant mobility,” he said. “They basically assume that any type of plant can grow in any location where the climate is the same.” But it isn’t quite that simple. Part of the problem is that the scientists who study plant migration and the scientists who build carbon-cycle models have tended to work separately, Higgins said. “What we did [in the study] wasn’t something that people tended to do before,” he said. “We had to break the model.” Scientists who have examined the fossil record by studying pollen deposits found in bogs have found that in past periods of climate change, plants had very limited capacity to migrate. The paper by Higgins and Harte, an environmental science professor at the University of California at Berkeley, describes a range of possible impacts this slower migration might have on the carbon cycle. But Higgins told InsideClimate News that his view is that it is more likely that “we’ll see plants and soils giving up carbon” and serving as a “positive feedback,” rather than storing it. “Constrained plant movement would exacerbate the losses of carbon due to changes in climate, because plants wouldn’t be able to move to those locations where climate becomes favorable for them,” Higgins said. “In some locations [or for some plant types] there would be increases in carbon storage, but in other locations carbon losses from plants and soils could be large. Thus, total carbon storage could go down. “Our results suggest that the overall effect of climate change would be to reduce carbon storage in plants and soils. CO2 fertilization could counteract the consequences of climate change. However, CO2 fertilization might or might not actually happen. If it doesn’t, then the losses of carbon due to climate change could be large.” The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that the amount of warming by",

    "content": "The government of Canada’s official position on climate change is that it’s real and requires an “aggressive” response. Despite that, Canada’s ruling Conservative Party government has been leading a slow and systematic unraveling of environmental and climate research budgets, according to local scientists—including shuttering one of the world’s top Arctic research stations for monitoring global warming. Hundreds of researchers have lost their jobs, and those that remain are forbidden from talking to media without a government minder. “They publicly announce their commitment to dealing with climate change and acknowledge that it is a serious issue, but then they go ahead and do the exact opposite,” said Andrew Weaver, a climate modeler at the University of Victoria and a lead author of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “They’ve closed virtually every funding avenue for climate and atmospheric science. They are deceiving the Canadian public.” The alleged “war on science” is so bad that some scientists are leaving Canada for jobs in countries where they feel they have more opportunities and freedom. Protests by scientists and their supporters have erupted across the country in recent months. Representatives from Environment Canada, the federal environmental agency, and Industry Canada, the department in charge of economic development and investment, denied that the government has targeted environmental science or scientists. “It is wrong to suggest that science … in this country is under assault,” said Stefanie Power, a spokesperson for Industry Canada. Primer Minister Stephen Harper’s office did not respond to requests for comment; it has previously said the cuts are cost-saving measures to balance the budget and slash the country’s $26 billion deficit. But some scientists and environmental groups say the eliminated climate programs are a tiny fraction of the budget and that at least one of the government’s goals with the cuts is to reduce opposition to oil sands development, the backbone of Canada’s energy economy. Extracting and processing oil sands crude creates 20 percent more well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions than drilling for conventional oil. Harper has weakened some environmental regulations, including fast-tracking permit reviews of oil sands pipelines and mines. He has also pulled Canada from the Kyoto Protocol, the global treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and appointed climate skeptics to head scientific agencies, including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, whose work benefits industry. Canada’s natural resources expansion plans are “driving absolutely everything in the country right now,” said Tom Duck, an atmospheric scientist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. “Our capacity to do environmental science is being rapidly destroyed. We’re hemorrhaging scientists here.” Budgets Being Cut, but Why? In July, in a rare show of outrage, thousands of scientists, graduate students and supporters marched through the streets of Ottawa in white lab coats to protest the cuts in federal science spending, the first of several protests. Climate science programs and researchers have been some of the hardest hit from the cuts—especially since the passage in June of the 500-page Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act, also known as bill C-38. Under that bill, a federal advisory panel established in",

    "date": "2012-11-07T21:07:24-05:00",
    "content": "Even before President Obama took the stage for his victory speech last night, environmentalists were laying out their expectations for his second term: act on climate change, whether it’s through sweeping legislative action, regulatory rules or decisions like blocking the Keystone XL pipeline. Just minutes after the race was called Tuesday night, the group 350.org announced a Keystone XL protest on Nov. 18. Young climate activists who joined the celebration outside the White House held up a sign saying “Sandy Demands Climate Action Now,” a reference to the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. One line in Obama’s victory speech gave the green groups hope that he might act. “We want our children to live in an America that isn’t burdened by debt, that isn’t weakened by inequality, that isn’t threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet,” the president said. But taking action to achieve those goals isn’t going to be easy. While more than a dozen legislators targeted by environmental groups for their votes on clean energy and climate change bills were defeated Tuesday, neither chamber switched parties. With the status quo likely to continue in Congress, environmental groups say they’ll pressure the White House to continue, or amplify, its work of the last four years. “When I listened to his speech, I was happy to hear that he talked about the problem of climate change in the category of things the country can agree on,” said Lou Leonard, managing director of climate change for the World Wildlife Fund. “The president needs to continue to build on that narrative in the transition. We need him to join the conversation we’re having about climate change and lead that conversation in Washington.” Eileen Claussen, president of Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said Obama “has an opportunity and an obligation to press the case for stronger climate action.” “No one is better placed than the president to help Americans understand both the risks of a warming climate and the opportunities of a clean-energy transition,” Claussen said in a statement. There’s even a push for Obama to take a larger role on the world’s stage. In a statement congratulating Obama, a spokesman for United Nations secretary general Ban-Ki Moon said the secretary general looks forward to working with the president on “tackling the challenges posed by climate change,” among other issues. And Tom Mitchell, head of climate change for the Overseas Development Institute, a British think tank focused on international development and humanitarian issues, urged Obama to “show the kind of leadership that would put him amongst the all time greats,” including going to the international climate talks that begin later this month in Doha, Qatar. Obama’s biggest challenge, however, will be getting legislation through Congress. Many environmental groups expect that, given Republican opposition in the House, the administration will continue using its regulatory authority to pass environmentally friendly regulations. In Obama’s first term, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first greenhouse gas limits on new power plants, proposed the first national standard for mercury from coal facilities and bolstered fuel economy rules for passenger vehicles. By the end of the year the EPA also is expected to release a rule that would limit pollution from existing power plants and refineries. Before the election, there were reports that the EPA was trying to push the power plant rule out quickly, in case Mitt Romney won the presidency. “For the next couple of months, we expect to see the EPA just finishing the business at hand. Chief among that is addressing pollution from power plants and what waters can be regulated under the Clean Water Act,” said David Goldston, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. In a second term, the EPA could consider rules governing coal ash waste and ground-level pollution, analysts say. Groups that generally oppose action on climate change are, like the environmental groups, girding for what might be coming from the White House. “This election really didn’t change much in terms of the dynamic in Washington in the sense that President Obama stays in the White House and Congress stays the same,” said James Taylor, senior fellow for environmental policy for the Heartland Institute, a noted climate skeptic group. “So we’ll probably just see this battle where EPA is taking severe measures and a different path than Congress might have taken.” On Wednesday the Institute for Energy Research, a free-market research group, issued a statement warning that “Within a few days, we can expect the EPA and other agencies to start issuing the regulations they have been withholding until after the election. These regulations will drive up the price of oil, coal, and natural gas by making their exploration, production, transportation and consumption more costly and uncertain.” Eric Pooley, senior vice president for strategy and communications for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), said his group already plans to push the federal and state governments to look beyond carbon and address “climate accelerants” like methane and refrigerants. On methane, Pooley said, that means addressing potential leakage from natural gas extraction. “There are no laws on the books, federal or state, targeted at methane leakage,” Pooley said. “We have the technology to stop these leaks, but we haven’t really measured the leakage rate. We think there’s a place for federal and state regulation on this.” EDF has been criticized by some green groups for supporting hydraulic fracturing, the controversial gas extraction method, albeit with restrictions. But Pooley said it’s important to use natural gas as a bridge fuel and to ensure that the extraction is as safe and clean as possible, which requires federal leadership. The EPA is studying fracking, but it’s unclear if any regulation will come out of that research. Like most of Washington, environmental groups will be watching how Obama deals with Congress on the approaching fiscal cliff. If a budget deal isn’t reached to reduce the national debt, across-the-board cuts through the budgetary sequester could go into effect in January with potentially dire consequences for the environment, they say. The sequester could mean the closure of some National Parks, the elimination of some National Wildlife Refuges and cuts to coastal management programs, according to a fact sheet assembled by NRDC, The Wilderness Society, Defenders of Wildlife and the National Parks Conservation Association. The budget trimming could also mean cuts to EPA research and air monitoring programs, reductions in clean water infrastructure and cuts to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. “The environmental community has a lot at stake … Sequestration could cripple environmental programs now and into the future,” said NRDC Action’s Goldston. Goldston said a deal should include raising money by cutting subsidies for, “industries that are mature, wealthy and produce pollutants.” Environmental groups say the Democrats’ slightly expanded majority in the Senate offers some hope for extending the wind production tax credit for renewable energy. They predict the industry will face layoffs and other setbacks if the credit is allowed to expire at the end of the year. “These are proven, bipartisan job-creating tax measures that are up for extension or renewal. We’re putting a lot of effort to getting Congress to meet the president on those issues,” said David Foster, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which represents a variety of labor and environmental groups. “Voters, I think, did say resounding say yes to the president’s clean energy job strategy and I hope Republicans listen to that.” The EDF’s Pooley said the administration should at least start a conversation about instituting a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. “Ultimately if you’re serious about cutting carbon emissions, you’ve got to price it,” Pooley said. “We’re a long way from having this debate, let alone understanding what legislation would look like. But there needs to be a conversation about solutions, and not just a list of demands from the environmental community.” The NRDC’s Goldston said the environmental community will be pressuring the administration to act on this and other environmental issues, starting today. “We will be making sure the administration knows that the public wants more action on climate change,” Goldston says. “That’s going to be important for whatever battles follow.” Environmental Groups Celebrate Election Wins Environmental groups have been encouraged by the results of some House, Senate and statewide races. Citizens Determined to Elect Clean Energy Champions, which is led by a coalition including climate scientist and activist Bill McKibben, assembled a list of 14 “climate heroes” who had backed clean energy in the past. Eleven of those candidates won, and one race was too close to call at the time of this posting. The victors include Democratic Senate candidates Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin), Martin Heinrich (New Mexico), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Chris Murphy (Connecticut) and Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts). House candidates Julia Brownley (California), Ami Bera (California), Lois Capps (California), John Delaney (Maryland), Fran Pavley (California) and Carol Shea-Porter (New Hampshire) also won. In the undecided race, Jay Inslee leads in the tight race for Washington governor, but challenger Rob McKenna had not conceded as of Wednesday afternoon. The League of Conservation Voters saw impressive results in its “dirty dozen” campaign to remove 12 national candidates they said had consistently voted against clean energy and conservation. Eleven of those candidates, including Mitt Romney, were defeated. Among the defeated were Republican Senate contenders Dennis Rehberg (Montana), George Allen (Virginia), Josh Mandel (Ohio), Heather Wilson (New Mexico) and Linda McMahon (Connecticut). Joining them were House candidates Tim Holden (Pennsylvania), Joe Walsh (Illinois), Francisco Canseco (Texas), Dan Lungren (California) and Ann Marie Buerkle (New York). Buerkle, Lungren, Canseco and Walsh were also on LCV’s “Flat Earth Five” list of Congressional members that have denied climate change. One member on the list—Michigan Rep. Dan Benishek—held onto his seat. “This election was supposed to be about wealthy Big Oil-backed special interests spending unprecedented resources to wipe pro-environment candidates off the map,” said Gene Karpinski, the League of Conservation Voters’ president, in a statement. “But voters chose a different course—re-electing President Obama and sending environmental champions to Congress to confront the climate crisis and keep our nation moving forward towards a clean energy future.” Correction: An earlier version of this article said the UN interenational climate talks in Doha, Qatar were being held next year. The talks will take place Nov. 26-Dec. 7,",

    "content": "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie captured national headlines—and conservative scorn—for praising President Obama and opening his arms to federal assistance as his state recovers from the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. How, right-wing advocates ask, could a fierce White House critic and fiscal conservative like Christie seek federal money so brazenly? The size of government has been a key issue throughout this election, but as voters head to the polls on Tuesday, Sandy is adding a new wrinkle to the debate. As more federal agencies get involved in the cleanup and recovery, the discussion is likely to intensify, no matter who wins the White House. Much of the focus has been on the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA. But the federal response to Sandy also includes the U.S. Departments of Transportation, Energy and Health and Human Services, and other, less prominent federal agencies that will be called in as the recovery continues. Some of the services provided by these agencies have faced cuts in recent years, as Republican members of the House of Representatives tried to pare down a government they say has grown too big for its own good. The budget plan drawn up by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, cut 62 percent from a budget category called community and regional development—which includes FEMA, flood insurance and some rural development programs—according to the nonpartisan think tank Third Way. Nearly half of that money, said Third Way senior fellow David Kendall, goes to disaster relief and insurance. Although it’s unclear exactly which programs would be cut, Kendall said “there’s no way they could make those cuts without taking a big chunk out of disaster relief.” The federal government’s role in disaster relief has been defined in the last century by a series of bills, notably the",

    "title": "Climate Change: What’s at Stake in Today’s Election",
    "date": "2012-11-06T10:30:57-05:00",
    "content": "New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s last-minute endorsement of President Obama last week—released in an editorial titled “A Vote for a President to Lead on Climate Change“—wasn’t simply a big political event. It also raised the issue of climate change to a level that hadn’t been seen in the long presidential campaign. Groups that have been monitoring the candidates’ positions on climate change say it’s unclear what impact Bloomberg’s statement—which said the devastation from superstorm Sandy “should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action”—will have on today’s election. But it has drawn new attention to the differences between Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. “The president would continue to work on investing in clean energy, continue initiatives to reduce carbon pollution and pushing to end tax breaks of big oil,” said Jeff Gohringer, national press secretary for the League of Conservation Voters, a political advocacy organization dedicated to supporting pro-environment candidates. “If Mitt Romney becomes president he will be the first president ever to reject the scientific consensus surrounding climate change. “So you can see the clear contrasts and what those respective politics hold for the country.” “I think we’ve seen that President Obama is much more inclined to impose regulations that restrict carbon emissions than President Romney would,” said David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that questions climate change. “Some of those things are already set in and will require quite a bit of effort to undo, but things going forward could be considerably different.” Romney and Obama made only passing references to climate change during their convention speeches (Romney’s in the form of a joke) and the subject didn’t come up at all in their three debates for the first time in decades. But environmentalists and other election watchers say its emergence during the final two weeks of the campaign could force the winner of the presidential race to address climate change sooner rather than later. “It seems that there’s a new awareness of this problem and the risks of climate change after Sandy,” said Kurt Davies, research director for Greenpeace. “We can only hope that it creates more attention in the policy arena and I think it will. … It’s given us a chance to actually talk to the candidates about this issue.” Davies and other observers agree that no matter who wins, there’s likely to be little in the way of comprehensive legislation or policy. With Congress deadlocked on most issues and environmental legislation a no-go for years, they say most climate and energy policy will probably come from the White House. If Obama Wins If Obama wins a second term, environmentalists expect him to continue using his regulatory authority to make strides on addressing carbon and other emissions without Congressional approval. In Obama’s first term, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first greenhouse gas limits on new power plants, proposed the first national standard for mercury from coal facilities and bolstered fuel economy rules for passenger vehicles. Under the stimulus package, he also steered billions of dollars into clean energy loans, grants and tax credits—which financed the construction of wind and solar farms, jump-started an electric vehicle battery industry and launched the smart grid. “I would expect the administration to move forward largely in the same way, in making environmental protection one of its hallmarks,” said David Goldston, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. “Should Obama win, it gives him a little more ability to move forward on his proposals on efficiency and clean energy that are not only good for the economy, but the environment,” said Cathy DuVall, national political director for the Sierra Club. After Hurricane Sandy, she added, “the climate reasoning for it won’t be treated as a joke.” The fact that the Obama administration has already started working on these issues sets the stage for swifter action, said Rob Sisson, president of the Republican group ConservAmerica. “It will be a lot quicker for them to tee it up and move ahead,” said Sisson, whose group focuses on natural resource conservation. “This is an administration that has already laid the groundwork. “With the national environmental and conservation movement in place, and with a growing appreciation for these issues by those in the center, a second administration will have the momentum to move forward.” That’s not good news for groups on the right, who say EPA regulations have been hurting businesses and would like to see them scaled back. Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation thinks Obama’s work on climate change has been “held in check” by Congress and Obama’s reelection bid. “With no additional elections for him to face, I think we’ll see more aggressive work. And I don’t think we’ll see the Keystone XL pipeline,” Kreutzer said, referring to the pending decision on whether the controversial Canada-to-U.S. oil sands pipeline should be approved. If Romney Wins Environmental groups say it’s hard to predict what might happen under a Romney administration. While there’s general agreement that he would be less likely than Obama to push for regulatory action, his changing rhetoric on the trail and his pro-environment work as Massachusetts governor leave his future plans a question mark. “To some degree, it’s anyone’s guess. He’s staked out some positions on a very extreme agenda … but on the other hand his rhetoric has become increasingly moderate,” said NRDC Action’s Goldston. As a governor, Romney incorporated climate change mitigation into state policies and even helped push Massachusetts into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) with other Northeast states. He later pulled Massachusetts out of RGGI, citing the program’s economic impact. (The state rejoined the pact under Gov. Deval Patrick.) Since the start of the presidential campaign, however, Romney has hardened his talk on climate change, downplaying the human influence on global warming and arguing that environmental regulations have hurt businesses and worked against the market. At the Republican convention in Tampa, Romney drew laughter when he said, “President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet.” (That line was later repurposed into an anti-Romney ad from the advocacy group Forecast the Facts.) But the aftermath of Sandy has softened Romney’s rhetoric, offering some hope, Goldston said. “At least he went back to admitting that climate change is real. Now we just need to make sure he would do something,” Goldston said. Other environmentalists aren’t so sure that Romney would act on climate change as president. “With his election he’ll put oil back in the driver’s seat and put big corporations in the driver’s seat and put them in control of America energy future,” said Gohringer of the League of Conservation Voters. Gohringer estimates that 3 million jobs in the renewable energy industry could be at risk if Romney were elected and that protected lands could be offered up for development or oil and gas exploration. “Romney, who had taken some very laudable steps as governor, reversed all of those positions … during the general election,” said Sierra Club’s DuVall. “That’s not necessarily because his beliefs have changed, but because of the sheer amount of [oil and gas] money coming in and the advisers that have influenced the campaign.” But Sisson of ConservAmerica, which did not endorse a presidential candidate, said that because Romney is a “sharp business person,” he would do what some of the nation’s major corporations have already done and factor climate change into his policies. Still, Sisson added, “there will be a large number of things in line ahead of climate,” especially with the economy still reeling. The Heritage Foundation’s Kreutzer said he expected Romney to act but “with less of a push into EPA and more of sort of legislative deal-making.” Kenneth Green, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said that could come in the form of a carbon tax as a replacement for EPA regulations, but only as part of a broader tax reform package from Congress. Whichever way the election goes, the scars left by Hurricane Sandy will put pressure on the next president to address climate change, said Greenpeace’s Davies. “There’s now a broader constituency than just the environmental movement,” Davies said. “There is a convergence of national security specialists with insurance companies, businesses, people who lost a lot in the storm and people who were pretty upset. There’s going to be a lot of pressure, far beyond the regular movement.” InsideClimate News reporter David Hasemyer contributed to this report.

    "title": "Nebraska Pipeline Debate Dies Down Despite Unresolved Problems with Keystone XL Route",
    "date": "2012-10-15T08:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "The decision to detour the Keystone XL around land owned by its noisiest opponents, plus the distraction of the fall election, has lowered the volume of protests against the proposed pipeline. In the reroute TransCanada released in early September, 55 miles of the pipeline still run through Holt County, an area that sits above the aquifer and is especially vulnerable to oil spills due to its permeable soils and high water table. Despite a few small adjustments, the route through the county is nearly identical to the route TransCanada, the pipeline operator, proposed in April. The project’s opponents blame the sudden drop in activism on the fact that local environmental groups that organized much of the anti-pipeline publicity are now focused on the November elections. They also say that TransCanada blunted the opposition by moving the pipeline off of land owned by some of the pipeline’s most vocal opponents, including Karl Connell, Calvin Dobias, Richard Miles, Joe Moller, Randy Thompson, and Kurt and Laura Meusch. “When you look at a map, when you know the landowners, [you see] they’ve avoided the landowners who’ve gone to the press,” said Ben Gotschall, energy director for the advocacy group Bold Nebraska. “They’re just figuring out the easiest way to get their pipeline built.” Gotschall said the reroute has disrupted his group’s momentum, forcing it to reach out to people whose land was recently added to the route and who aren’t necessarily familiar with the project. Ken Winston, a policy advocate for the Sierra Club and one of the pipeline’s most vocal opponents, told InsideClimate News last week that he is so busy working to get state Sen. Ken Haar re-elected that he hasn’t even had time to study the new route. Haar, a Democrat, played a prominent role last year in the successful effort to force TransCanada to move the pipeline out of the sensitive Sandhills region. He’s made that a cornerstone of his campaign. But like Winston, Haar hasn’t had time to examine the latest reroute. “It’s out of my hands at this point,” he said. “Sometimes you have to sit back and let the process happen.” Rancher Vows to Stay Involved The current lull worries Calvin Dobias, who operates a cattle ranch in Holt County. Although TransCanada has routed the pipeline away from his land, Dobias said he will continue to fight the project. His land is crisscrossed by eight gravel-bed springs fed by the Ogallala aquifer. Because the water table is so high, the springs flow almost year-round. Like other landowners, Dobias fears a leak would contaminate the water source that sustains not only his ranch but also provides water for 78 percent of Nebraskans. Dobias said both the Sierra Club and Bold Nebraska “have calmed down” in recent weeks. And he thinks TransCanada made a strategic move when it shifted the route away from outspoken pipeline critics. “I think they did it to take some of the pressure off,” Dobias said. “And believe me it did. I can only do what the [new] people on the route want me to do. And they don’t want to be as involved as [I was].” In an email, TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard said “[r]outing decisions were made based on environmental and a number of considerations, and were based on direction we have received from the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality. A new route would eliminate some of the previous landowners while bringing in new ones and we recognize this.” Gotschall sees the lastest reroute as a mark of success for the anti-pipeline movement, even though the opponents in Holt County didn’t get most of what they wanted. It tell us that “what we’re doing is working,” he said, because TransCanada shifted the route rather than continuing to confront the vocal landowners. “We’ve gotten TransCanada’s attention and they’ve done some things differently as a result of our efforts.” But Gotschall also said the reroute has forced Bold Nebraska to regroup. He’s now busy calling each of the 50 to 75 newly affected landowners, a time-consuming process that requires forging new connections and arranging meetings to discuss how the pipeline will impact their lives. Haar, the state senator, said changes could still be made to the route, because a number of state decisions are still pending. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is reviewing the latest route and is expected to publish its findings in the next few months. Meanwhile, three landowners are suing the state over its pipeline siting law. A victory for them could result in a more rigorous Keystone XL environmental review. Three Attempts to Settle on Route The latest route marks TransCanada’s third attempt to get the pipeline approved in Nebraska. The original route created a backlash when it cut through the Sandhills, a fragile grassland ecosystem that overlies the critically important Ogallala aquifer. Late last year, Nebraska legislators reached an agreement with TransCanada to move the pipeline out of the region. The company’s revised route skirted the edge of the Sandhills, but about 60 miles of the line still passed through Holt County, which has sandy soils and a high water table—the same features that make the Sandhills vulnerable to contamination. The DEQ noted those problems in its evaluation of the second route, and TransCanada went back to drawing board. But the company’s third and latest route appears to have removed less than five miles from Holt County. Kyle Graham, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who works with Sandhills ranchers on sustainable land management, said most of the sensitive areas that were on the second route are still on the new route. Although Graham has been following the pipeline controversy, he said he neither supports nor opposes the project. Holt County lies at the eastern edge of the Sandhills, and Graham said the landscape there is so similar that it’s hard to distinguish where the Sandhills begin and end. At least half of the county has a high water table, with a depth to groundwater of less than 20 feet, he said. “In that part of the world, I don’t know that there’s anything you can draw a line on and say, ‘Here’s an area that’s ultra sensitive and here’s an area that’s not,’ ” he said. The new route incorporates two small detours in central and southern Nebraska. TransCanada moved the pipeline a few miles in those areas in response to DEQ and landowner concerns about sensitive local groundwater sources. The third detour, known as the Northern Alternative, involves Holt County. In the report TransCanada issued when it released the latest route, the company said the adjustments in Holt County were prompted by “numerous comments” from landowners and the DEQ about the sensitive terrain. But Jane Kleeb, director of Bold Nebraska, said the reroute is “just another of TransCanada’s PR tools.” “They’re still going over sandy soil and the Ogallala aquifer,” she said. Kleeb, like other opponents, wants the project moved 100 miles east, next to an existing TransCanada pipeline that runs over less permeable soils and a deeper water table. The Keystone XL is designed to carry Canadian diluted bitumen, also known as tar sands oil, which is much harder to clean up than conventional oil when it spills into water. The Environmental Protection Agency recently released a study showing that substantial pools of bitumen are still submerged in Michigan’s Kalamazoo River more than two years after a ruptured pipeline released more than a million gallons of diluted bitumen into the waterway. The EPA’s new findings could extend that cleanup by another year and add tens of millions of dollars to the $809 million that the Canadian pipeline operator, Enbridge Inc., has already spent on the cleanup. The Keystone XL was originally intended to run from Alberta, Canada to the Texas coast. But the project needs State Department approval before it can cross the U.S.-Canada border, and the Obama administration has said it won’t make that decision until after the November presidential election. To keep the project moving, TransCanada divided it into two parts. While the company waits for federal and state permits for the northern section, which includes Nebraska, construction has begun on the southern half, which doesn’t require a State Department permit. Activists in Texas recently blocked access to several properties along that section of the route. More than 20 protesters have been arrested and two New York Times journalists were briefly detained while reporting on the blockade. Dobias, the Holt County landowner, sympathizes with the people in Texas who are “fighting a fight that’s very tough.” He said he had planned to travel to Texas in early October to support the protestors, but was unable to go due to the work demands on his ranch. Dobias worries that newly affected landowners along the Nebraska route see the pipeline as inevitable and won’t fight to delay or halt construction. “They just think it’s going to go through. Once we get them educated about [the risks]…they don’t want it, but they don’t know what to do.” Bold Nebraska’s Gotschall said he encourages all the landowners—including those who support the pipeline project—to join the Nebraska Easement Action Team, or N.E.A.T., a nonprofit that represents landowners during easement negotiations with TransCanada. “The landowners looking out for [their] best interests don’t have to be against the pipeline,” Gotschall said, “but they still have to protect their land, water, and the future of their property.” Brian Jorde, a lawyer for N.E.A.T., said landowners can get better terms on their contracts if they negotiate as a group. Richard Stelling joined N.E.A.T. because he’s concerned about the pipeline’s effect on land and property values. The new route will cross four of his family’s farms in Antelope County, southeast of Holt County. “Unless I get a heck of a price, I’m not interested,” Stelling said. “We’ve got the best water in the world here, so if we get it contaminated, what the hell do we have?” Andy Grier, who co-owns land on the new route, considers himself “pro-energy” but says he is against the pipeline because of its environmental risks. “Regardless of whatever safety protocols are in place, any leak, even of minor significance…is going to be an issue.” Grier lives in Omaha and rents out his land in Holt County for grazing cattle and harvesting hay. He’s talked to Gotschall but hasn’t joined N.E.A.T. “It just seems a little early right now,” he said, adding that he would consider joining when the situation becomes more “intense.” “I can’t imagine anything will get really critical” until TransCanada gets all the permits it needs for the northern leg of the project, he said. The most important permit is the federal approval that TransCanada needs to cross the U.S.-Canada border. Mitt Romney has pledged to grant the permit on his first day in office if he is elected president. It’s unclear how the Obama administration would respond if the president is re-elected.

    "title": "Thousands Make Last Plea to Include Climate Change in Presidential Debates",
    "date": "2012-10-01T14:00:03-04:00",
    "content": "Aside from Mitt Romney’s recent jab at Barack Obama’s concern over global warming—and the president’s tit-for-tat response—climate change has been largely under the radar in the campaign. But several groups, backed by hundreds of thousands of petitions, are trying to change that, at least for one night. Nine environmental organizations Friday delivered more than 160,000 petitions to Jim Lehrer urging him to ask a question about climate change during Wednesday’s first presidential debate. The goal is to bring attention on a national stage to an issue that’s been pushed aside in the election, said Mike Palamuso, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, one of the groups involved in the petitions. “They talk about key moments in the election. One is the VP pick. Another is the respective party conventions, and the third is the debates,” said Palamuso. “Two of those have passed, so in some regards this is the last big event in the presidential election. “It represents an opportunity where millions of voters are tuning in … to have this front and center.” The advocates’ push follows a poll showing that global warming is one of the most important issues to 61 percent of undecided voters. Wednesday’s 90-minute televised debate at the University of Denver—the first of three this month—will focus on domestic issues. A list of topics released by Lehrer showed a focus on the economy, governing style and health care. The petitions are just one of several attempts to get climate change added to that list. 350.org, a climate advocacy organization founded by author and activist Bill McKibben will put up a billboard in Denver this week asking for more climate talk. Friends of the Earth Action and Forecast the Facts teamed up for a social media campaign called “Climate Silence” to urge more talk on the trail, and beyond. The goal, said 350.org media campaigner Daniel Kessler, is to create so much discussion around the topic that “Lehrer just can’t ignore it.” “It’s less up to him, but it’s on us to create enough noise about this,” Kessler said. “Climate change touches on so many issues, including agriculture and jobs and the economy, so there’s always a chance to work it in. But we’re still not at that point.” Although Obama talks about clean energy as a way to improve the economy, he has made scant mention of climate change. That’s a sharp departure from the last presidential election, when both he and Republican candidate John McCain bolstered the consensus that global warming is real, man-made and pressing. But skepticism about climate science has become part of the GOP’s core message, and political urgency in Washington to curb emissions has faded. Romney—who once supported carbon regulations—had his biggest climate moment of the campaign in the form of mockery. “President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet,” Romney said in his convention speech. He paused as laughter erupted, adding, “My promise is to help you and your family.” That merited a response from Obama during the Democratic convention the following week. “My plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax.” But that was the extent of the discussion. And so the debates—particularly the first debate, which is traditionally the most watched—offer a chance to discuss the issue in front of tens of millions of voters from both sides of the aisle. Generally, environmental issues haven’t been voting priorities for most Americans, said Marjorie Hershey, a professor of political science at Indiana University, who specializes in campaigns and elections. “To increase citizens’ understanding and concern, these issues need to make it onto the political agenda. One way to do that is to include it in the presidential debates, where the audience for politics is much higher.” In fact, University of Missouri communications professor Mitchell McKinney said that merely mentioning an issue during a debate can help elevate it in voters’ minds. McKinney has tracked presidential debates for more than two decades, including viewers’ responses. He has found that voters’ “issue agendas” tend to change before and after debates. “An issue, especially one like climate change, may not register on people’s issue agendas, but if it gets mentioned during a debate we find it creeps up there,” McKinney said. For example, he said that transportation infrastructure didn’t rank highly in voters’ minds until it was brought up during a",

    "content": "The harassment faced by U.S.-based climate scientists has been well documented in the media—but not the harassment of scientists in Europe, Canada or the rest of the world. That’s because there hasn’t been much to report. While outspoken scientists of human-caused climate change in the United States endure torrents of freedom of information requests, hate mail and even death threats from skeptics, their counterparts abroad have been free to do their work without fear. Jochem Marotzke, managing director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, said there is “no systematic attempt by a political camp” to target climate scientists in Germany. “I get the odd critical email from a skeptic, but would not classify anything as personally aggressive,” said Marotzke. “Very different from the U.S. scene.” “I feel for my American colleagues and what they’ve had to deal with,” saidTim Lenton, an earth system scientist who specializes in climate tipping points at the University of Exeter in the UK. Lenton said he has never had to fend off skeptic attacks against his work or his integrity. “British scientists aren’t immune to attacks, but it is a very different level than compared to what is happening in the U.S.” InsideClimate News contacted scientists working on climate change in Europe, Canada and Japan and learned that virtually everyone believes that the harassment is specific to the United States. They said that it could have long-term consequences for public understanding of global warming. “The harassment has an intimidating effect—especially on young scientists,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Rahmstorf said that watching colleagues be harassed often deters them from speaking to media or the public about their research, which skews the debate. Already, there is evidence of the U.S. public being swayed, said Tony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. Climategate, for instance, the",

When the CPC issued its initial forecast on May 24, it appeared the season would probably be about normal, although the forecasters gave themselves plenty of wiggle room. Because of uncertainties about the emergence of El Niño, they said there would be between nine and 15 named storms, four and eight hurricanes, and one and three major hurricanes. “We give a range that is determined by the science,” said Gerry Bell, who leads the CPC’s hurricane forecast team. “If there is uncertainty, you need a bigger range.” By now, the hurricane picture is usually in better focus, and the range of possibilities narrows. But El Niño is not showing its cards, and that leaves the forecast cloudy. “No one disputes that it will become an El Niño,” said Mike Halpert, the CPC’s deputy director. “It’s just a question of when.” Usually, people wouldn’t be disappointed if El Niño helped keep the hurricane season quiet. But this year, a couple of productive storms could go a long way to lessen the impacts of one of the worst and most widespread droughts in the continental United States in 50 years.

    "date": "2012-06-25T12:30:11-04:00",
    "content": "The renewable energy industry’s main trade group has officially come out swinging against the political backlash and negative press its members have endured since solar manufacturer Solyndra went bankrupt last year. “We decided that we’re not going to just stand by and be defensive … in the face of this overwhelming onslaught of misinformation,” said Retired Vice Adm. Dennis McGinn, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), at the group’s two-day annual meeting. ACORE’s 600-plus members represent billions of dollars in renewable energy business, and are involved in more than 80 percent of the nation’s existing and contracted clean energy projects, the group says. Fossil-fuel interests and clean energy opponents in Washington have “dominated the conversation [on renewables] through misrepresentation, exaggeration, distraction and millions and millions of dollars in advertising,” McGinn, a 66-year-old Navy veteran and national security strategist, told an audience of hundreds of renewable energy and finance leaders last week. “No more. We can no longer allow America’s energy debate to be one-sided to the detriment of our nation,” he declared in the ballroom of the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The goal now is to hammer home the “impressive growth rates … of new clean energy generation, billions of dollars in investments and a multitude of jobs.” McGinn’s statements represent the first time that the doggedly nonpartisan and business-minded group has taken such a firm stand to protect the image of its industries. ACORE told InsideClimate News it reached its decision after members repeatedly complained that every recent hiccup or bad apple was being blown out of proportion. The most well-known of these was Solyndra, recipient of a $535 million federal loan guarantee under the Obama administration. After the solar panel maker went bankrupt last summer and fired 1,861 people, many Republicans used it as a cudgel against taxpayer-supported clean energy economy programs. Missed sales targets from electric car makers were also cast as a sign of imminent failure for green vehicles, among other things. The negative publicity “threatens the market momentum that we’ve achieved and the success to date,” McGinn said. Injecting positive stories into the U.S. renewable energy debate will not be easy. There’s a “degree of hostility towards the clean energy agenda that I don’t recall having seen in my 25 years working in the space,” said Daniel Esty, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy & Environmental Protection and a former professor of environmental law at Yale University, in a keynote address at ACORE’s conference. Over the past year, congressional Republicans have moved to the right on clean energy and climate change issues, and fossil-fuel backers continue to throw money into advertising on behalf of GOP candidates. Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a conservative group founded and funded by oil industry interests, including billionaire oil executives Charles and David Koch, has spent $8.4 million since November to run one-minute spots on T.V. and on social media sites accusing Obama of cronyism with Solyndra. The ads ran in key swing states like Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Since its first Solyndra ad blitz, AFP has spent $20 million on anti-Obama ad buys and expects to spend a total of $100 million by November, the Los Angeles Times reported last week. The Koch brothers’ network will funnel $400 million into a handful of conservative groups this election season, Politico reported in May. The 11-year-old ACORE represents companies from across the clean technology spectrum—from solar, wind and energy efficiency to biofuels and electric cars. Its members include solar developers BrightSource Energy and SolarCity, banking giant Goldman Sachs and utility Duke Energy.

Not so in Virginia, where even the words “sea level rise” and “climate change” are verboten. Earlier this year, state lawmakers found they could not use those phrases in requesting a study on potential impacts on Virginia’s coastal cities. Reporter Scott Harper of the Virginian-Pilot said Republicans objected, fearing it would stir up conservative activists, some of whom believe such terms are liberal code words. And in North Carolina, officials are hiding their heads in what comedian Stephen Colbert called the “soon-to-be-underwater sand.” Out in California, a survey published by Stanford University’s Center for Ocean Solutions and the California Sea Grant found that a majority of California’s coastal planners and resource managers now believe the threats from climate change, including rising sea levels, more floods, beach erosion and loss of coastal access, are substantive enough that steps must be taken to deal with them. The survey of 600 coastal professionals showed a big jump in acknowledgement and planning for climate change since the last time the poll was taken. “Six years ago, just a handful of communities had begun to talk about climate change and had plans to address it,” Susanne Moser, a researcher who worked on the survey and has studied how communities respond to climate-change impacts since the",

That is what happened with climate change.

    "date": "2012-05-09T12:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "In climate science, some ideas seem to live forever like vampires, despite repeated attempts to slay them. A New York Times story last week focused on one of those ideas and the man behind it: Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The story caught the eye of climatologists everywhere. Lindzen believes clouds will be our savior, because he says they’ll help prevent catastrophic impacts from global warming. His pitch has made him the darling of naysayers and a pariah among the vast majority of climate scientists who find his research badly flawed and his conclusions unsupported. Joel Norris, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, is among those who have followed Lindzen’s cloud theory over the years. In an interview with InsideClimate News, Norris said it’s unusual for discredited scientific ideas to keep resurfacing, as Lindzen’s have for more than a decade. What usually happens, Norris says, is the scientific community dissects a faulty theory, finds its flaws, and then dismisses it. After that, you don’t hear much about the idea. But that’s not the way things work in the world of climate science, where people outside the scientific community may have a vested interest in recirculating discredited ideas. Lindzen has many people willing to support his cloud theories. He has testified before congressional committees chaired by global warming skeptics, written commentaries that have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, and is treated as a hero by groups around the world fighting proposals to institute a carbon tax, including the Heartland Institute. “You have people who keep propping it [discredited theory] up,” said Norris, whose specialty is long-term changes in clouds. “Lindzen may still hold to it, but no one would still be listening to him. He wouldn’t be given a platform.” Norris and other cloud scientists acknowledge there’s not a vast data set on the inner working of clouds today, much less in the future. Climate change skeptics tend to seize on that void. Lindzen doesn’t dispute that adding CO2 to the atmosphere could cause an increase in temperatures. His view of what happens later is where he parts with most climate scientists. He believes Earth will be able to self-regulate its temperature, like a thermostat, because of clouds. Dense low clouds do tend to cool the earth’s surface by reflecting most sunlight back into space. Thin high clouds, mainly ice crystals, let most sunlight through, then trap the reflected heat near the surface. Through a mechanism he calls the iris effect, Lindzen asserts that a warmer atmosphere will have fewer high clouds—and that without those clouds to trap the rising heat, the upper atmosphere would be better able to vent the heat into space. Norris says Lindzen starts with the assumption that the earth isn’t very sensitive to greenhouse gases, then jumps to faulty conclusions that are driven by what he’s hoping to find, not by what the data actually show. “It comes down to looking at the relationship between clouds in the present-day climate and then trying to infer what will happen in the future. [His] interpretation of what will happen is not well supported.” Norris used this analogy: If someone were to look off the coast of San Diego during a strong Santa Ana wind event, they might see a brown line of air pollution—and no clouds. To conclude that pollution is keeping the clouds away, not the strong offshore winds, would be the kind of erroneous leap and dot-connecting that Lindzen makes in his research, Norris says. While nonscientists aren’t prohibited from joining dots without solid data to support the connection, that process is supposed to be unacceptable to scientists. Norris admits there is still much to learn about how clouds operate, and there is no consensus on what their overall impact will be on a warmer planet. Estimates range from negligible to significantly adding to the warmth. “Clouds are complicated,” he said. “It’s difficult to represent them in a global climate model. Clouds are small.” Another problem: Scientists don’t have a good, continuous record of clouds, a stable monitoring system, or an agency charged with monitoring clouds. Norris said the best cloud record, produced by a couple of NASA’s weather satellites, only goes back about 10 years. If science can’t yet paint a detailed picture of future cloud conditions, using faulty science to fill out the frame isn’t the answer. “A lot of the time, I don’t know what’s there,” Norris said of his own research. “Sometimes, you do have a hypothesis, and if it’s not borne out, you abandon it. But I get the impression that Lindzen just looks for something else to support it.” Data Problem May Worsen A report by the National Research Council warns that the U.S.’ earth observing satellite system is beginning a rapid decline in capability, as long-running missions end and key new missions are delayed, lost due to launch failures or cancelled. “The projected loss of observing capability will have profound consequences on science and society, from weather forecasting to responding to natural hazards,” said Dennis Hartmann, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, and chair of the committee that wrote the report. “Our ability to measure and understand changes in Earth’s climate and life support systems will also degrade.” Budgets for NASA’s earth science program are inadequate to meet pressing national needs and are likely to remain so, the report says. Another problem is the shortage of reliable and affordable satellite launch capability. The study was sponsored by NASA. Growing Chorus for Climate Action Tampa, Fla., is the latest city to join the growing list of U.S. cities that are urging national leaders to use the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas pollution to head off catastrophic climate change. “Climate change is a grave threat to the economy and environment of Tampa Bay, so the city council is urging the federal government to take immediate action through the Clean Air Act,” said Mary Mulhern, the Tampa city councilmember who led the effort to pass the resolution. “We’re proud to join almost two dozen other cities in urging the Environmental Protection Agency to move swiftly.” Global warming poses a threat to South Florida’s tourism and agricultural industries, Mulhern said. Rising sea levels and retreating shorelines will leave the Tampa Bay area more vulnerable to hurricanes, and salt water intrusion from sea-level rise could endanger aquifers used for water supplies, according to a",

Stevenson, 62, runs a successful, century-old family business that sells construction supplies and materials to control soil erosion in Northern California. But retirement was hanging over him and his wife. “I really wanted to get to the point where we could get our [utility] bill down to virtually nothing,” Stevenson recalls. So last year, after spotting an ad for a local financing program that lets homeowners slash energy consumption at no upfront cost, he applied. Since October, Stevenson has borrowed $140,000 from Sonoma County to retrofit his $1 million home and add renewable power. The debt gets repaid over two decades through a special assessment of $3,500 on his twice-yearly property tax bill. “It just made dollars and sense to do it,” Stevenson says. The three-year-old initiative, called the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program, is one of the few and the largest in the country to embrace the contentious Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE, model. So far, the financing technique has helped about 1,720 Sonoma homeowners and 50 commercial property owners upgrade their homes and buildings. One of the richest counties in California, Sonoma has spent more than $56 million in public funds to finance the liens. That investment has created 680 jobs across the U.S. clean economy, including about 70 local positions in construction and engineering, the county says. Today, cities and counties nationwide are looking to Sonoma for guidance on how to get their own such programs off the ground at a difficult time, when federal authorities have branded PACE a steep risk to the still-shaky U.S. housing market.

    "date": "2012-04-05T12:13:09-04:00",
    "content": "The French energy company Total estimates that its North Sea Elgin field gas well is leaking about 200,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day, enough, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, to supply more than 100 average homes with natural gas for an entire year. Total estimates that it may take six months to stop the leak. If the gas continues escaping at that rate, and all of it reaches the atmosphere, it would approximate the annual global warming impact of 35,000 Americans, says Carnegie Institution for Science Department of Global Ecology director, Christopher Field. At a news conference on Monday, Total’s chief financial officer, Patrick de la Chevardiere, said that because the leak involves natural gas, which disperses into the atmosphere very quickly, and not crude oil, “the current impact on and risks for the environment are relatively low.” But climate scientists and biologists say the leak’s impact shouldn’t be dismissed just because it isn’t creating a beach- and wildlife-fouling oil slick. The leak, detected March 25th, is at the wellhead platform of Total’s G4 well, located approximately 150 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland. The gas is mostly methane, which is considered the second largest contributor to human-caused global warming after carbon dioxide. The gas is believed to be coming from a rock formation almost 2.5 miles below the seabed and almost 2/3rds of a mile above the well’s main gas reservoir. The gas, however, is leaking at the platform level, rather than deep underwater. The well was plugged in February",

    "content": "France’s Total is laying plans including a helicopter water drop, fire-fighting vessels and spraying nitrogen to extinguish a flare on its Elgin North Sea gas platform that is leaking explosive clouds of gas, the energy department said. The flare, lit as part of evacuation proceedings to relieve pressure in the abandoned rig, cannot be turned off remotely and remains at risk of igniting the explosive plumes pumping out of the platform, the department said. But it added aerial surveillance suggests the flame has reduced in size, offering hope for a safe resolution to the crisis. The authorities have praised the embattled French oil firm’s handling of the leak, one of the North Sea’s biggest in decades, calling it “effective” and conditions on the rig “stable” as hydrocarbons continue to spew into the atmosphere. Total has dismissed the risk of a blast at the platform and has two fire-fighting ships ready to act outside a two mile-exclusion zone set up to protect marine traffic. Experts warn Elgin could become “an explosion waiting to happen.” The leak started on Sunday and forced the evacuation of all 238 workers from the platform, which sits in waters less than 100 metres deep and 240 km (150 miles) off the east coast of Scotland. Total as well as UK authorities have described the expected environmental impact from the plume of gas and a spreading sheen of light oil on the water as “minimal,” although environmental experts said much of the gas “cocktail” would be either flammable or poisonous at close quarters. Memories are still raw in the North Sea industry of the Piper Alpha platform fire 24 years ago, when 167 people were killed in the world’s deadliest offshore oil disaster. The energy department said that while alight the flare remained a risk despite prevailing winds blowing the gas cloud away from the flame for the foreseeable future. “Total has assured the government the platform is designed so the flare is located in a position where the prevailing wind blows the gas release away from it,” it said. The team of international experts advising Total on how to plug the leak – which has now entered its sixth day – has not made its final recommendation, it said. Options The options on the table include drilling a relief well, the safest but also slow and costly, and pumping heavy mud into the stricken well from the platform itself, faster but far more dangerous. Relief drilling would take six months and require boring through 4 kilometres of rock with painstaking mathematical precision, because it must intercept the gas pocket at exactly the right point, an engineer said. The accident has thrown a spotlight on the safety record of energy production in the British sector of the North Sea, with union officials claiming that the frequency of safety lapses has become intolerable. The depth of the pocket leaking gas to the Elgin platform via compromised layers of piping suggests there is more gas present rather than less, increasing the pressure on Total to drill a relief well, an engineer with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The company previously said it hoped the leak would run itself dry as reservoir pressure dropped, removing the need to bore a hole that could take six months and cost up to $3 billion. Total believes a section of well pipe 4,000 meters below the seabed – prey to conditions of high pressure and temperature – had become porous, the energy department said. The government said it had convened a crisis committee of energy ministry, healthy and safety, marine and coastguard officials from England and Scotland to advise and monitor on Total’s response. Credit ratings agency Fitch said current reports of the leak suggested the incident was not as serious as the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico. That blast killed 11 workers and ruptured BP’s Macondo well, unleashing millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. BP struck a deal estimated at $7.8 billion with businesses and individuals suing over the spill.

    "date": "2012-03-15T11:00:57-04:00",
    "content": "The revelation last month that the Heartland Institute, a libertarian group based in Chicago, is trying to teach climate skepticism in schools has sparked a flurry of criticism and debate over the entry of global warming doubt into the classroom. But how easy is it, really, for a group with an ideological mission to influence science curricula? While it is hard to judge how Heartland will fare, climate denial materials have already begun to creep into public schools, said O. Roger Anderson, chair of the math and science department at Teachers College of Columbia University, in an interview. That’s what Anderson says concerns him. Anderson said that generally, it is atypical in the sciences for social or political organizations to get a place in the classroom, because their lesson plans tend to contradict the process of creating curricula, which involves vetting by scientists and education experts over several years. “We want students to look at scientific data like researchers do, critically, but only as long as it is driven by sound scientific logic—not tainted by ideological or philosophical positions.” But the consensus of man-made global warming isn’t required study by most school districts, and there are still no national standards for how, or if, it should be taught. That leaves many science educators free to include climate change in courses however they want—by, for instance, teaching the scientific consensus on climate change, or explicitly advocating skepticism as a valid scientific proposition as Heartland does. Politically conservative educators who reject evidence for global warming are increasingly seeking out supplemental materials that present the skeptical view, said Mark McCaffrey, programs and policy director for the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), a science advocacy group. He believes that is why Heartland, known for its work with the tobacco industry and its annual climate skeptic conference, has ramped up its efforts. Last month, leaked strategy documents revealed that Heartland aims to spend $200,000 over an estimated two years to sow doubts about the consensus on human-induced climate change in K-12 classrooms. The group hired David Wojick, a consultant who has authored dozens of articles, editorials and reports that promote skepticism about global warming, to develop the curriculum. The modules for grades 10-12, for example, would challenge the view that earth is warming and humans are to blame. They would also question the reliability of climate models and the belief that carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that scientists say is the biggest contributor to climate change, is a pollutant, the documents showed. “[They] will be a nice counterweight to the many, many materials distributed that present an overtly political and alarmist message in regards to climate change unfortunately being used in school systems,” James M. Taylor, environmental policy fellow at Heartland, told InsideClimate News. “By contrast, our materials would be based on sound science and fact.” McCaffrey said the problem is that the curriculum creates debate where there isn’t one. “A curriculum based on teaching both sides of the issue doesn’t accurately reflect the current science.” A",

    "date": "2012-03-01T13:30:25-05:00",
    "content": "As U.S. environmental groups renew their battle against the resurrected Keystone XL oil pipeline, their counterparts in Canada are facing a deeper problem—a government campaign to limit their influence over Canada’s Northern Gateway pipeline. The proposed Northern Gateway would funnel tar sands crude oil from Alberta to the Pacific Coast, where Canada could ship the oil via tankers to China and other countries. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed his support for the $6.6 billion project in January, before the first public hearing was held, and he reiterated his position during a recent visit to China. Alberta’s tar sands contain the world’s third largest reserve of oil, but the province is landlocked. The booming oil industry there wants to build new pipelines to carry its crude to ports along the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast to gain access to global markets. The Northern Gateway would consist of two 731-mile pipelines. One would funnel up to 525,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta to the city of Kitimat on the British Columbia coast. The other would flow from Kitimat to Alberta, carrying a liquid used to dilute the heavy crude so it can flow in pipelines. The pipelines are controversial because they would cross vast forests and the two largest salmon-producing streams in Canada. British Columbia is also home to 200 First Nations communities, the aboriginal peoples indigenous to Canada, most of whom oppose the project. Art Sterritt, executive director of Coastal First Nations, an alliance of 10 communities along the Pacific Coast, said his group will challenge the proposed pipeline in court if necessary. “We have a good culture in British Columbia,” he said. “There’s a renewable forest industry and a renewable fishing industry … What we’re now seeing is a non-renewable industry from another province trying to overwhelm us.” As environmental groups have stepped up their campaigns against the project, key figures in the Harper administration have publicly denounced them as extremists, and a federal finance committee has announced plans to audit all of Canada’s charities. In an internal government memo obtained by Greenpeace Canada, industry associations were listed as “allies” and environmental NGOs and aboriginal groups as “adversaries.” Northern Gateway’s supporters have focused much of their attention on where charities get their money. Canadian charities are exempt from most taxes and can issue tax deduction receipts to their donors, similar to 501(c)(3) organizations in the United States. In early January, Harper told reporters that “foreign money” is responsible for the growing opposition to the Northern Gateway project. Days later, Minister of Natural Resources Joe Oliver said in an open letter that, “These groups threaten to hijack our regulatory system to achieve their radical ideological agenda …They use funding from foreign special interest groups to undermine Canada’s national economic interest.” According to the St. Paul Journal, Brian Jean, a member of Parliament from Harper’s Conservative party, is drafting a bill aimed primarily at the charities that receive funding from U.S.-based foundations. Neither Jean nor his assistant would answer questions for this article. When InsideClimate News contacted Harper’s office for comment, a spokesman directed our inquiry to the Minister of Natural Resources. Oliver’s office did not respond to requests for information. Ed Whittingham, executive director of the Pembina Institute, said any attempt to limit foreign funding could affect Canada’s entire charitable sector. Pembina is a nonprofit think tank that promotes sustainable energy. “It’s hard to know how the federal conservative government could restrict foreign funding for environmental NGOs without restricting funding for right-wing think tanks, social agencies and [other] charities,” Whittingham told InsideClimate News. “The risk is they’d use a blunt instrument that would be too blunt.” Environmental groups say the government’s aggressive pro-industry stance is part of a coordinated strategy to curb opposition to the Northern Gateway. It’s a “transparent attempt to divert attention from the real issues” surrounding tar sands development, said Gillian McEachern, deputy campaign director at Environmental Defense Canada. “Climate change is a global issue … we’re working across borders.” Megan Leslie, a member of Parliament who represents the New Democratic Party on matters of environmental policy, said “this issue is not about the fact that U.S. foundations are contributing to environmental groups. It’s about silencing the environmental groups.” The New Democratic Party holds the second highest number of seats in the federal House of Commons (Canada’s main legislative body), which is dominated by Harper’s Conservative party. An Unusual Audit of Charities In late March or early April, the House of Commons Finance Committee will begin reviewing how Canada’s charities spend their money. Brian Jean is a member of that committee. The government has done spot checks on individual charities in the past, Leslie said, but she couldn’t recall a systematic audit of the entire charitable sector. “We’re keeping a really close eye on it to make sure it isn’t just an attack on environmental groups,” she said. Current regulations prohibit charities from spending more than 10 percent of their budget on advocacy, but the definition of advocacy is “murky” and open to interpretation, said Todd Paglia, executive director of the charity ForestEthics. He fears the committee may use the review to selectively restrict the advocacy of anti-tar sands organizations. The upcoming review, coupled with the strong rhetoric against environmentalists, is “creating a culture of fear,” Paglia said. “Every nonprofit I talk to in Canada is worried about the next shoe dropping,” he said. The government “is looking for ways to stifle dissent, and it’s having a pretty serious impact on us.” Much of the debate has revolved around Paglia’s organization. ForestEthics was founded in",

The review, by the board of directors of the Pacific Institute, was the most serious potential repercussion to date of the admission by Peter Gleick that he had lied to obtain fundraising documents and a donor list from Heartland, the rightwing think tank devoted to discrediting climate change. A statement on the website of the Pacific Institute, which Gleick founded and now heads, said the board was “deeply concerned” about the ruse carried out against Heartland. “Neither the board nor the staff of the Pacific Institute knew of, played any role in, or condones these events,” the board said. Gleick was not the only potential career casualty of the Heartland affair. Earlier on Wednesday, a Democratic member of Congress called for an investigation into whether a Department of the Interior employee, Indur Goklany, had broken the rules by taking a salary from Heartland at the same time he was working for the federal government. The payments were revealed in Heartland documents released by Gleick. The statement from the Pacific Institute comes just 24 hours after the board reaffirmed its support for Gleick. “Dr Gleick has been and continues to be an integral part of our team,” the earlier statement said. But since then a number of its funders have expressed displeasure at Gleick’s deception, the Guardian has learned. “Obviously we are concerned about any allegations of unethical conduct and Dr Gleick has already admitted to it and apologized.

    "content": "Energy companies are honing plans to export natural gas faster than President Obama can call the United States the “Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” and that’s raising new questions about the country’s energy policies. Multinational energy firms and some economists say exporting natural gas is a no-brainer: the cost of producing natural gas in the United States has plummeted with the explosion in shale gas production, while prices remain high elsewhere in the world. That means exports could ease the U.S. trade deficit while stimulating job growth. But some U.S. manufacturers, utilities and consumer advocates counter that exporting natural gas will drive up electricity prices, deepen reliance on dirtier coal and discourage investment in domestic manufacturing. A government study released last month reinforced their concerns. The independent Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that U.S. natural gas prices could jump 36 to 54 percent if every export plan currently on the table goes through. Electricity prices could rise 2 to 9 percent, the report says. Even as the debate intensifies, energy companies are laying foundations to become the first to export natural gas from the United States. No export facilities currently exist in the continental United States, but eight companies have applied to build them. At the facilities natural gas is cooled to -260 degrees Fahrenheit, so it becomes what’s known as “liquefied natural gas,” or LNG. At 1/600th the volume as its gaseous form, LNG can be loaded onto special tankers berthed at the new facilities and shipped across the world. (Paragraph includes correction, 03/04/",

    "date": "2012-02-07T12:00:19-05:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—A barrage of industry-led advertising and lobbying urging President Obama to “put jobs ahead of politics” has fueled the impression that labor unions universally champion the Keystone XL oil pipeline. But that myth was blown apart just minutes after the president rejected the $7 billion project on Jan. 18. That’s when five labor unions that had kept low profiles on the pipeline—including the 2 million-member strong Service Employees International Union—issued a joint statement backing Obama’s decision. Not only did they laud him for acting “wisely,” but they also emphasized the need to address climate change and find sustainable and secure energy sources. Since then, a more nuanced snapshot has emerged of where labor unions stand on Keystone XL. That newer picture weakens industry’s argument that the pipeline has broad union support. The handful of unions that praised the president and questioned the project’s merits represent close to 5 million members. Membership in the five unions publicly promoting the project is near 3.3 million. (See chart.) Labor Unions Supporting Keystone XL Source: Union websites and news releases. Totals include active and retired members in the United States and Canada. Unions rarely march in lockstep on every national issue. But the labor movement has a long tradition of allowing unions with the most at stake on a particular project—in the case of Keystone XL, the building and construction trades—to take the lead. Keystone XL has disrupted this familiar pattern, in part because unions have growing concerns about global warming. The 1,702-mile pipeline would carry a particularly dirty type of heavy crude oil from Canada’s tar sands mines to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Scientists agree that harvesting and refining this oil is speeding the warming of the planet. “Climate change demands that we rethink everything,” said Joe Uehlein, a former union construction worker and AFLA-CIO officer. He’s the founder and executive director of the Labor Network for Sustainability, a nonprofit that educates trade unions about environmental issues. It’s wrong to present Keystone as a choice between jobs and the environment, Uehlein told InsideClimate News. “This notion that we’ve never met a job we didn’t like has to change,” he said. “We need to be looking at jobs through a carbon lens. From carbon emissions alone, all unions have a stake in high-intensity projects such as [Keystone XL]. We can fix the economy and climate change … but not by supporting 20th century energy projects.” One of the labor unions that signed the Jan. 18 joint statement—the Transport Workers Union—was among the first to speak out against the pipeline. In August, the Transport Workers’ president, James Little, and the president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Larry Hanley, issued a statement saying that approving Keystone XL’s six-state route would be a mistake. Their concerns included the destruction of Canada’s boreal forest, groundwater pollution, carbon intensity and refinery emissions. Their announcement didn’t garner much attention, perhaps because their relatively puny combined membership of 390,000 doesn’t carry much clout. “We need jobs, but not ones based on increasing our reliance on tar sands oil,” Little and Hanley said in a press release. “We therefore call for major New Deal-type public investments in infrastructure modernization and repair, energy conservation and climate protection.” Divide and Conquer Environmental risks weren’t all that prompted the Transport Workers to sign the Jan. 18 statement with the Service Employees International, the United Steelworkers, the United Auto Workers and the Communications Workers. They were aware that the GOP and other pipeline proponents were intent on cleaving the president’s base by pitting labor unions against environmentalists. Congressional Republicans tried to ensnare the president in that divide-and-conquer lair in late December by launching legislation that forced Obama to decide the fate of Keystone XL within a 60-day window. They also inflated the number of pipeline-affiliated jobs. The Keystone XL would require a construction workforce of between 5,000 and 6,000, according to documents filed with the State Department. But recent full-page newspaper ads placed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce put the jobs number at 20,000. Others, including House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), have claimed the count is 100,000 or more. Almost 1.5 million construction workers were unemployed in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. After Obama said “no” to the pipeline, Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, tipped his hardhat to the president for refusing to bow to Republican pressure. “The White House is facing forces in Congress that have decided to use this project as a litmus test for their commitment to jobs,” Gerard said in a news release. “But the fact is, more time is needed to ensure that this project will have the economic and environmental benefits claimed by the developer.” Gerard and the other signers of the joint statement asked why Republicans have tried to turn the Keystone XL into a poster child for jobs when the GOP has stymied a string of other legislative attempts to expand employment. The joint statement mentioned several examples, including the Restore the American Dream Act, which one analysis shows could create and save 2.3 million jobs this year and 3.1 million jobs in",

    "title": "Gas Drilling May Be Leaking Twice as Much Gas as Previously Thought, Study Finds",
    "date": "2012-02-09T21:30:36-05:00",
    "content": "Weeks after Barack Obama promoted natural gas as a key part of U.S. energy policy in his State of the Union address, new research says gas drilling may be emitting far more methane and other pollutants into the atmosphere than current estimates suggest. The work, performed by scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, focused on Weld County, Colo., home to more than 20,000 gas wells. After years of monitoring and study, the researchers estimated that about 4 percent of the methane produced by these wells is lost to the atmosphere. That’s about twice as much as current estimates would suggest, and twice what the EPA assumes is lost nationally during gas drilling and production, said Gabrielle Petron, a lead author of the study. “What I’ve learned in the past three or four years is that there’s a lot we don’t know, and the industry may not be aware of these leaks and how important they are,” Petron, a researcher with NOAA and the University of Colorado, told InsideClimate News. “Until you go out there in the field and take measurements you may not have a sense of what is leaking and how much it’s leaking.” Methane accounts for about 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. Leaks during the drilling, production and transmission of natural gas are the largest source, accounting for about a third of all man-made methane emissions. In addition to methane, the researchers also found surprisingly high emissions of benzene, a carcinogen, and other pollutants. Petron said the study, which is being published by the Journal of Geophysical Research, is the first to take atmospheric measurements of emissions from gas drilling. Current estimates are based primarily on isolated sampling and data provided by drilling companies, she said. States and the EPA use that data to build models for extrapolating emissions. Advocates have been pushing the industry for years to capture more of the gases that leak during drilling and production. Jeremy Nichols, director of the climate and energy program at WildEarth Guardians, a New Mexico-based environmental group, said gas companies shouldn’t wait for more studies to begin reducing emissions. “At some point we should just realize there are really good policy solutions here,” he said. “Fixing a leak in a pipe? That just seems like common sense. We shouldn’t have to quantify how much is leaking before we do it.” Some drilling companies have begun to use “green completion,” a technology that captures much of the emissions when wells are hydraulically fractured. And the EPA has created a voluntary program, Natural Gas STAR, that encourages drilling companies to capture and sell stray methane. But Nichols said the new research shows that drillers could do better. He analyzed NOAA’s new data and found that the emissions produced by Weld County’s gas wells are equal to the carbon emissions of 1-3 million cars. “No matter which way you slice it, that’s a lot of greenhouse gas emissions, and that’s just one county,” he said. In July, the EPA began creating the first federal regulations to reduce emissions during drilling and fracking. In response to a lawsuit filed by WildEarth Guardians, the agency proposed new rules that would reduce smog-forming emissions by almost 95 percent, the EPA said. While the rules don’t require drillers to target methane, the agency said limits on other pollutants would have the benefit of cutting methane emissions by a quarter. The EPA said it will release the final rules in early April. The drilling industry has criticized the data that the EPA used for the rules, saying it over-estimates emissions. In comments to the agency, the American Petroleum Institute said the proposed rules are too burdensome. The group did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Petron’s work suggests that even with the EPA’s proposed reductions, gas drilling could remain a significant source of greenhouse gases. Such emissions have caused some to question whether natural gas is much of an improvement over coal. The gas industry and some environmentalists have said that gas emits about half as much climate-altering pollution as coal when burned to generate electricity. They’ve used that number for years to support using gas as part of a “bridge fuel” to a more climate-friendly energy future. But when the methane emitted during drilling and production is included, the benefits shrink. In late",

On Wednesday, the Obama administration rejected a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which could have increased imports of the fuel into the U.S. by up to 830,000 barrels a day. It was a major setback for the oil industry and its allies and an unexpected victory for environmentalists and their allies. The two sides are now facing each other down in this court case. California’s low-carbon fuel standard is the world’s first attempt to require oil suppliers to slash the carbon footprint of their motor fuels, measured not just by emissions from tailpipes but across their full lifecycle, from extraction to combustion. Eleven Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, and the European Union, are closely tracking California’s case because they are working to adopt similar rules. The state’s influential Air Resources Board, or CARB, adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in",

    "content": "When the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL oil pipeline last week, it cited concerns over the project’s route through Nebraska as one reason for its decision. That segment of the pipeline is now being rerouted, in response to Nebraskans who spent years persuading lawmakers to move the tar sands pipeline—intended to carry crude oil from Alberta, Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast—out of the Nebraska Sandhills, a fragile ecosystem that overlies the Ogallala aquifer. Nebraska state Sen. Ken Haar, a 68-year-old Democrat who is nearing the end of his first term, played a key role in the movement’s success. Haar has worked as a science teacher, business owner and inventor, and is a former executive director of the state’s Democratic Party. He helped found the Save Our Sandhills coalition, a non-partisan group that includes organizations as diverse as the Sierra Club and the Independent Cattlemen of Nebraska. Haar was also the first public official to call for a special session of the legislature to discuss a pipeline reroute. In November, that special session was finally held, and an agreement was reached with TransCanada to move the pipeline out of the Sandhills. One of the bills passed during the session gave the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) authority to study alternative pipeline routes. In an interview with InsideClimate News, Haar talked about his plans for the future, why he chose to get involved in the Keystone XL controversy and the importance of citizen activism. He also warned that the public must remain vigilant, because the pipeline will likely be built. How do you feel about President Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL? There’s a political game going on in Washington. We did what we needed to do for Nebraska, and we can’t control what’s going on in Washington. Now, other forces are going to have to go after it. When did you first hear about the pipeline, and what was your initial reaction? It was probably three years ago, and [at first] I wasn’t disturbed about it. A lot of things have happened in the meantime—the oil spill in the Gulf, the Kalamazoo River spill, the Yellowstone River spill. All of those have caught our attention to the fact that there can be spills that are very damaging to the environment. So how did you get involved? About a year ago, I was at a conference put on by the Center for Rural Affairs, and a young man gave a presentation on Keystone XL and where it was going to go and where it came from. I left that meeting just feeling like we’ve got to do something. There were some groups—Bold Nebraska and the Sierra Club—already working, but they were working to get a ballot initiative that would have gone on the",

    "date": "2012-01-05T13:30:02-05:00",
    "content": "If the Keystone XL oil pipeline were approved today, residents in the six states along its route would not receive equal treatment from TransCanada, the company that wants to build the project. The differences are particularly striking when it comes to tax revenue and environmental protection. States with stronger regulations have won protections for their citizens, while other states sometimes focused more on meeting TransCanada’s needs. In Kansas, for example, lawmakers gave TransCanada a 10-year tax exemption, which means the state won’t receive any property tax revenue from the pipeline. Meanwhile, each of the other five states—Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas—would earn between $14 million and $63 million a year, according to U.S. State Department estimates. Click here for a chart that compares how the six states are dealing with the Keystone XL pipeline. When it comes to route changes and protection for landowners, residents of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have fared the worst, because their states haven’t created any regulations to safeguard their interests. “All the power is in the hands of the pipeline companies,” said Chris Wilson, an independent environmental consultant from Texas who opposes the Keystone XL. Landowners along the route “are really screwed…there’s no one in the government they can call for help.” The Obama administration put the Keystone XL on hold in November, saying it needed another year to reassess the environmental risks the project could pose. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are trying to force the president to make his decision by February 21. The pipeline would move oil from the tar sands of Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Because the Keystone XL would cross state boundaries, both federal and state agencies are involved in its regulation. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) handles safety issues, such as pipeline thickness and operating pressure. Individual states are responsible for pipeline siting, the process that determines a pipeline’s exact route within state borders. But only the state of Montana has chosen to exercise that power, leaving citizens who object to the pipeline’s path in other states no option but to shell out money for a court battle, or appeal to local officials who often lack the resources and experience to challenge a major corporation. In Montana, however, the state’s Department of Environmental Quality used a decades-old siting act to minimize environmental damage along the route. TransCanada has rerouted more than 100 miles of the Keystone XL in response to agency and landowner concerns. If the pipeline is approved, the company also must post a bond so funds are available to repair construction-related damage. DEQ staffer Greg Hallsten, who worked on Keystone XL siting, said that although TransCanada sometimes objected to the agency’s reroutes, its complaints were overruled. “We have [siting] authority in the state,” he said. “Our authority’s never been challenged along those lines.” TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the vast differences in pipeline regulation reflect the political landscape of each state. “We appreciate that each state has their own guidelines,” he said. “It’s not up to us to modify or create legislation. We’re working with the state governments to meet [their] guidelines and get this project approved.” Other states could follow Montana’s lead by pressuring their legislators to create pipeline regulation, said Pat Parenteau, a Vermont Law School professor who studies land use and environmental policy. “If there’s a popular enough demand,” it can be done, he said. That’s what happened in Nebraska, where residents worked for years to persuade their lawmakers to reroute the Keystone XL out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills. Farmers and ranchers picketed the governor’s mansion, traveled to Washington, D.C. and repeatedly called for a special session to draft siting regulations for interstate pipelines. As the momentum grew, TransCanada offered Nebraska a $100 million dollar spill bond for the Sandhills region—a protection it didn’t offer any of the other states. Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman finally called a special session in November, where bills were passed to move the pipeline out of the Sandhills and to give the Public Service Commission authority to site future oil pipelines (excluding Keystone XL). TransCanada is now working with state environmental officials to establish a new route for its pipeline. What Nebraskans have done is very significant, said Mary Boyle, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause. Legislators won’t act unless they feel outside pressure from constituents, she said, so getting those bills passed is “no small accomplishment…Nebraska citizens clearly proved this can be done.” Few Protections from Eminent Domain Despite the new regulations in Nebraska, landowners there, like landowners in all the Keystone states, have felt helpless when TransCanada used eminent domain to take their land. All six states have given the company the power of eminent domain. While the eminent domain laws vary from state to state, they generally allow projects built for a “public” good—including railroads, transmission lines and highways—to use private land after paying landowners a fair price that’s determined by the courts. But the laws aren’t specific about what “public” means, and pipeline opponents say Keystone XL shouldn’t be allowed to use eminent domain because it’s not serving the United States public. Harlan Hentges, an attorney who represented an Oklahoma family that challenged the taking of their land, says TransCanada is a foreign company transporting foreign goods (crude oil) across the U.S. for export. “To me it’s an outrage from beginning to end,” he said. Montana is the only state that offers its residents some protection from eminent domain. Its siting act requires that pipelines be built on public land whenever it’s economically feasible. As a result, 77 percent of the pipeline’s route through Montana falls on private land, while that number rises to more than 92 percent in the other five states. In Texas, all of the Keystone is routed through private land. Montana also doesn’t allow companies to take landowners to court until the DEQ gives a project a final stamp of approval, known as a Certificate of Compliance. In early December, the DEQ’s Hallsten told InsideClimate News that the agency didn’t plan to issue the certificate to TransCanada unless the federal government approved the pipeline. But Gov. Brian Schweitzer overruled the agency on Dec. 15 when he announced that TransCanada had met the siting act’s requirements and that the DEQ would issue the certificate within a few weeks. Sue Kelso, the Oklahoma landowner who hired Hentges to challenge TransCanada’s use of eminent domain on her family farm, said she feels abandoned by her state officials. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission—the agency in charge of pipeline regulation—has little control over interstate pipelines. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said the agency’s role is limited to remediation after oil spills. Kelso’s troubles began when a TransCanada land agent offered her $3,000 for a permanent easement on her property. Kelso said the agent claimed the pipeline would carry regular crude oil, but she soon found that Keystone XL would transport the tar sands oil known as diluted bitumen, or dilbit. Unlike conventional crude, the exact chemical composition of dilbit remains a trade secret. There’s little research on dilbit and no peer-reviewed studies on how it affects pipeline corrosion. Kelso’s concerns escalated after an Enbridge pipeline spilled dilbit into Michigan’s Kalamazoo River in July",

Some scientists think we’ve already crossed that boundary and are, as Jonathan Foley, director of the University of Minnesota Institute on the Environment, said, “in a very different world than we have ever seen before.” What scientists are now witnessing as the earth responds to increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases presents many of them with a dilemma: How far should they go in expressing their concerns about how government and society are responding to climate change? This question is particularly charged given that efforts to undermine climate science have become part of the political debate on these issues. Running through the meeting’s scientific presentations were formal and informal discussions about the scientist’s role in guiding society’s response to climate change, including how to effectively communicate the certainties and uncertainties of the science—and how to respond to what Don Wuebbles, University of Illinois professor of atmospheric science and chair of the organization’s Global Environmental Change committee, called the “confusionists.” After the meeting, InsideClimate News interviewed several leading climate scientists and a renowned science historian to get a sense of how they are navigating this difficult terrain.

    "content": "A deal with a native chief that Enbridge Inc. held up last week as an example of rising support of their planned oil pipeline to the Pacific appears to be unraveling as the community battles over who has the authority to negotiate. Enbridge touted the Gitxsan agreement to take an equity stake in the Northern Gateway pipeline as the first public display of what it says is substantial support for the $4.5 billion project among British Columbia’s First Nations, the aboriginal groups whose traditional territories make up vast swaths of the province. Enbridge signed the deal with Hereditary Chief Elmer Derrick, chief negotiator for the Gitxsan Treaty Society (GTS), an embattled organization that is facing a legal challenge to its authority from four of the five community bands that make up the first nation. Some other hereditary chiefs, community members and the three clans that form the complex structure of Gitxsan First Nation oppose the deal and met on Monday to try to shut down the treaty office and fire Derrick and other staff. “Many of the hereditary chiefs said that they had not been directly posed the question of ‘Do you want to sign this deal with Enbridge?'” said Doug Donaldson, who represents the region in the British Columbia legislature. “From a Gitxsan governance point of view, that’s not the way decisions are made, as far as not consulting everyone.” Many first nations have voiced firm opposition to Northern Gateway, which would carry crude to the Pacific Coast, where it could be shipped to Asia on supertankers. The line is supported by the Canadian energy sector and the Conservative federal government, who seek to diversify Canadian oil exports after Washington decided last month to delay approving the Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil sands crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Public hearings into the project are slated to start in the West Coast port town of Kitimat, British Columbia, on January 10 and run until final arguments in April",

    "content": "ALBERTA, Canada—Enbridge Inc’s proposed $5.3 billion pipeline to British Columbia poses a raft of environmental risks, according to a new report that signals the project will become the next battleground over the future of Canada’s oil sands. The study by a trio of environmental groups, released on Tuesday, comes fast on the heels of a decision to push back approval of TransCanada Corp’s Alberta-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline by more than a year. The delay has led Canada’s oil industry and Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government to intensify their emphasis on exporting oil sands-derived crude to Asia. The Enbridge project, known as the Northern Gateway pipeline, is the first attempt at doing that in scale. But the new report—issued by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Pembina Institute and Living Oceans Society—says the project would threaten native communities, salmon fishery and wildlife habitat on land and in waters off the West Coast. The report uses last year’s Enbridge pipeline rupture and oil spill in Michigan, and even the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, as examples of why governments and regulators should block the proposal to bisect the rugged Western Canadian province with steel pipe. Northern Gateway would move 525,000 barrels of crude a day to the port of Kitimat, where it would be loaded onto tankers and shipped to Pacific Rim refiners. The project is a key part of the Harper government’s plans for a National Energy Strategy. Regulatory hearings are scheduled to begin in January and will take months. About 4,000 people have registered to comment on the project. “The Joint Review Panel assessing the proposed project and the cabinet ministers with final decision-making authority over its fate should reject the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline given the grave safety risks it would impose on a culturally, economically, and ecologically valuable region,” said the report. Numerous Threats at Once The study also aims to build general opposition to Alberta oil sands development, which green groups say is 23 percent more carbon-intensive than conventional oil production. By contrast, a much-referenced report last year by IHS CERA, the energy consultancy, said it was 6 percent more carbon intensive when judged from production to end use. Environmentalists used similar greenhouse-gas intensity and other arguments in their battle against Keystone XL. They include an unproven assertion that oil sands-derived crude is more corrosive in pipelines, increasing risks of ruptures. An Alberta study released last week disputed that argument, but pointed out there is still no formal, peer-reviewed research on the controversial issue. The report said Enbridge has failed to gauge the impact on the pipeline if numerous threats emerged at once, as with the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which contributed to the Fukushima nuclear plant catastrophe. “A fall frontal rain storm that triggered a rock avalanche could rupture the pipeline. Poor weather conditions combined with associated floods and erosion could prevent ground or air access for emergency response crews,” it said. “Avalanches, rockslides, explosions, or leaks from the [proposed adjacent] natural gas pipeline all can have cumulative impacts that worsen the ability to respond.” (Reporting by Jeffrey Jones; Editing by Frank McGurty) Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

To date its priority has been emissions cuts, or “mitigation,” to keep climate change in check. But is it too late for that, as some scientists now say? Is it time for “adaptation” (finding ways to live with heat waves, rising seas and flooded coastlines and scarcer water and food supplies) to finally share focus and UNFCCC resources?

But then handfuls of activists experienced a series of “aha” moments that resuscitated their cause. First, they connected the dots between the BP oil spill, a do-nothing Congress and the “carbon bomb” that would likely be released if Alberta’s tar sands continue to be mined. They also began pressing President Obama on his promise to wean the country of its oil addiction. Gradually, something began to click. During the summer, more than 1,250 anti-pipeline protesters were arrested during a two-week sit-in at the White House. Hundreds more dogged Obama wherever he traveled across the country. And last Sunday, 10,000-plus flocked to the nation’s capital to encircle the eight city blocks around the president’s home. On Thursday afternoon, the newly energized climate activists discovered that the formula they had created had been wildly successful. That’s when State Department officials announced that they will delay TransCanada’s proposed $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline project while they search for a route that keeps it out of Nebraska’s fragile Sandhills landscape and irreplaceable Ogallala Aquifer. That decision will significantly slow—and maybe even halt—a project that would have pumped 900,000 barrels a day of a type of heavy crude called diluted bitumen from Alberta to refineries along the Gulf Coast.

    "content": "LINCOLN, Neb.—Nebraska and TransCanada Corp. agreed on Monday to find a new route for the stalled Keystone XL pipeline that would steer clear of environmentally sensitive lands in the state. Under pressure from green groups, the U.S. State Department last week ordered the company to find a new route for the line in a decision that set back the $7 billion, Canada-to-Texas pipeline by more than a year. The pipeline would deliver 700,000 barrels a day of crude from Alberta’s oil sands to Texas refineries. But environmentalists strongly oppose the project, because of the route, concerns about spills and carbon emissions from production of oil sands crude. In the deal with Nebraska, the state would pay for the new studies to find a route that would avoid the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, which provides water for millions in the area. “I believe we will put the routing issue completely behind us,” said Alex Pourbaix, TransCanada’s president of Energy and Oil Pipelines. “We have heard and we have listened to the people of the Sandhills.” The agreement will not change the timeline for a federal review, said a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, which has final approval for the project because it crosses an international border. “Nothing has changed in the process since last Thursday’s announcement as any new proposed routes will be subject to the thorough, rigorous and transparent review process we have undertaken throughout,” said Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the department. “Given the process, we cannot provide a specific end-date, other than to say that based on the total mileage of potential alternative routes that would need to be reviewed, we anticipate the evaluation could conclude as early as first quarter of",

    "content": "Connie and Leon Weichman had just finished branding some calves Monday when Connie’s niece texted her the news: TransCanada, the Alberta-based company that wants to build an oil pipeline through the middle of the United States, had finally agreed to reroute it away from the Nebraska Sandhills where the Weichmans live and ranch. The couple had been looking forward to this moment for almost four years, but the victory was less than they’d hoped for. TransCanada’s agreement with the Nebraska state legislature would keep the pipeline out of the Sandhills, an ecologically sensitive prairie that overlies the Ogallala aquifer. But it wouldn’t do anything to prevent the next route from swinging close enough to the Weichmans’ property to endanger their land. And it wouldn’t protect Nebraska ranchers outside the Sandhills, who are equally dependent on regional groundwater. Connie Weichman, a middle-aged woman with graying hair and silver-rimmed glasses, doesn’t consider herself an environmentalist and had never before participated in local politics. But along with a steadily growing group of Nebraskans—most of them also first-time activists—she and her husband played a key role in moving the pipeline route out of the Sandhills. Last week the State Department extended the pipeline review process by a year to study alternative routes through Nebraska. Four days later, TransCanada announced it would forgo the Sandhills route. Environmental groups throughout the nation have celebrated these events as a significant achievement in their battle to stop the pipeline, which would funnel up to 830,000 barrels of tar sands oil per day from Alberta to the Gulf Coast. But they also agree that the unlikely activists from Nebraska helped turn the tide. Ken Winston, a policy advocate in Nebraska’s chapter of the Sierra Club, said the Nebraska coalition included concerned citizens from throughout the state. “This is a movement that has come from Nebraskans, and it’s large spread,” Winston said. “Their involvement cut across the political spectrum…. Even if they reject the label, they are truly environmentalists in the best sense of the word.” The Weichmans’ entry to activism began in",

    "content": "WASHINGTON—As Brian Nowak made a beeline across Lafayette Square to the handmade “Minnesotans for Climate Action” banner, he was intercepted by a grinning 20-something. “I’m so happy to see you here,” the young man told the white-haired and bearded Nowak. “I was afraid it was only going to be people my age.” “Ditto,” thought the 59-year-old architect from a Twin Cities suburb. As the two mingled early Sunday afternoon in the park next to the White House, both were further relieved to discover that their fellow Keystone XL pipeline protesters were far from a homogenous lot. Skin tones varied from the palest of whites to the darkest of browns. The thousands who spilled into the nation’s capital via train, bus, bicycle, car and airplane included babies in backpack carriers, kids tumbling in leaf piles, sign-toting grandmothers, men in suits and ties, college students with a knack for inventive chants—and a handful of leashed dogs elated to be cavorting on a brilliant and sunny autumn day. The crowd’s goal was to give President Obama what activists dubbed a “solidarity hug” by forming a human chain to encircle the White House grounds. At first, Nowak fretted that the monumental effort would flop if the hordes that had signed up didn’t follow through on their convictions. But his worries vanished a few hours later, when what he had feared might be a mere trickle overflowed into a rumbling river of an estimated 10,000 people standing at least two to three deep, encircling what amounts to about eight city blocks. Most had donned organizer-issued orange vests, so an aerial view would have resembled a bizarrely colored moat around the most famous address in America. Nowak could have stayed home in the Upper Midwest, fleshing out plans for an ultra-low energy house he’s designing so he and his wife can reduce their carbon footprint. “But why should I bother with that if the big issue, this tar sands pipeline, isn’t being addressed?” Nowak said about the $7 billion, 1,702-mile project that opponents have labeled a “carbon bomb.” “I figured this is where I need to put my energy. This is going to be a watershed day.” President Lending an Ear? As author and Middlebury College professor Bill McKibben circulated through the park, he seemed astounded that 13,000-plus demonstrators had registered through Tar Sands Action and other advocacy organizations to form a ring around the White House. “Clearly a lot of people recognize the gravity of the situation,” McKibben, founder of 350.org, told InsideClimate News a few minutes before the 2 p.m. rally kicked off. “I’m just glad to see how bold and determined they are to make a difference.” Though actor Mark Ruffalo and other celebrities addressed participants from a small stage in the center of Lafayette Park, the crowd anointed McKibben as the top glitterati “get” of the afternoon. Young demonstrators lined up like hungry ducklings clamoring for his autograph on their cardboard protest signs. The affable and lanky activist with the boyish smile also accommodated a parade of journalists, whether they wielded a notebook, a digital recorder or a camera. He drew cheers when he told participants to “forget this red-state, blue-state stuff. This is the whole country coming together.” And more applause followed when he pleaded with Obama for “no more of this stunt double in the Oval Office. We need the real thing.” For months, McKibben and his coalition have pressured the president to stop hiding behind the State Department and accept full responsibility for granting or denying the pipeline permit. Their prodding began in earnest when McKibben and more than 1,200 protesters were arrested at a two-week summer sit-in at the White House that he spearheaded. Their efforts, he added, are reaping results. Last week Obama said publically that he will have the last word on the pipeline, which would pump up to 900,000 barrels of oil daily from the tar sands mines of Alberta to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. “The president seems to be stepping up,” McKibben said. “I will give the guy credit for saying that he will be making the decision. That’s what we’ve been saying all along.” McKibben attributed Obama’s turnaround to a recent big-media ad campaign launched by pipeline opponents urging the president to halt an “environmental crime in progress.” Also, Keystone XL protesters have dogged Obama at campaign and fundraising events across the country. Circle Is Unbroken Sunday’s rally began with 60 minutes worth of encouragement from McKibben and an assortment of actors, politicians, clergy, ranchers, activists and environmental leaders. Nowak snapped digital photographs of attention-grabbers, such as a protester with a cutout of an oil-stained bird perched on her head, and e-mailed them to friends back home. “I knew there was a reason my wife told me I needed a smart phone,” he joked about adapting to new technology. “But with these fingers, I’m just not very dexterous.” Close to 3 p.m., organizers divided the swelling masses into brown, red and orange teams bound for the White House. Leading the way was an impressively enormous pipeline replica crafted from black plastic emblazoned with “Stop the Pipeline” in giant white letters. Dozens of volunteers kept the caterpillar-like creation aloft on their fingertips. It measured several hundred feet long, a portable fan at its rear blowing enough air to keep it from collapsing. Nowak and his contingent of a dozen or so Minnesotans dutifully followed an airborne brown flag. Catchy jingles such as “Hey hey, ho ho, the Keystone XL has got to go” and “This is what democracy looks like” had tourists transfixed as the phalanx strode by the Treasury Department building at",

    "content": "The Canadian crude oil that would flow through the Keystone XL pipeline is either the lynchpin of U.S. energy security or the path to certain environmental destruction, depending on whom you talk to. Advocates say there is no evidence that it is any more harmful than other types of oil; critics say there is insufficient evidence that it is safe. There is little information to support either side. The oil that would flow through the pipeline is known as diluted bitumen, or dilbit, and it has become a lighting rod for controversy in the debate over the pipeline, which would send as much as 830,000 barrels every day from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada to refineries as far as Texas. The pipeline would cross six states, sometimes passing through environmentally sensitive terrain where spills would be of special concern. While bitumen has long been refined into oil, regulation of diluted bitumen has been slow to follow. Federal safety officials, for example, don’t know precisely which chemicals shippers mix with bitumen to create dilbit. And even industry groups can’t say exactly how corrosive dilbit is. Research is spotty and outdated; there have been no independent scientific studies exploring the relationship between dilbit and pipeline corrosion. Here’s a primer on what is—and isn’t—known about dilbit. What Exactly Is Diluted Bitumen, or Dilbit? Bitumen is a tar-like type of petroleum that is a byproduct of the oil refining process as well as a naturally occurring substance found in the oil sands of Canada, Venezuela, the United States and other countries. These sands are considered unconventional deposits, meaning that the petroleum doesn’t come from the oil wells that have traditionally supplied most of the world’s crude. Instead tar sands deposits are mined, usually using strip mining or open pit techniques. The oil can also be extracted by underground heating. In recent years the combination of high oil prices and new technology has made harvesting bitumen extremely profitable. Analysts forecast that capital investment in the oil sands market will reach $45 billion over the next decade. In its natural state, bitumen is extremely viscous and flows very slowly. To move it through pipelines, oil companies dilute it with chemicals called hydrocarbons to create diluted bitumen, or dilbit. The exact composition and quantity of these hydrocarbons—collectively called diluents—is considered proprietary information and is not shared with regulators. The bitumen itself contains many of the same chemicals found in regular crude oils, said Carl Weimer, executive director of the independent, non-partisan Pipeline Safety Trust. But he said there are a lot of unanswered questions about the nature of the chemicals added to bitumen to make dilbit. “I think everybody has a good sense of the tar sands itself … but the diluents used to move it through the pipeline is a whole separate issue.” While the Keystone project has focused the public’s attention on Canadian bitumen, plans are also under way to mine bitumen in Utah. Why Are People Worried? Multiple reports of ruptures in pipelines that carry dilbit have raised concerns about its safety. Most dramatic was the July",

    "content": "Five years ago, when the Long Island town of Smithtown passed a law requiring its garbage and recycling collectors to ditch their diesel haulers for trucks run on compressed natural gas (CNG), it was seen as a surprising step. At the time, only two of the nation’s truck builders—Autocar in Indiana and Oklahoma’s Crane Carrier Company—were making natural gas trash trucks. And virtually all their orders went to towns in Southern California, which had switched to CNG years before. “It was a very bold decision. No one had done it on the East Coast,” said Joanna Underwood, president of Energy Vision, a research organization that gave Smithtown guidance on its mandate. “None of the haulers on Long Island had ever used a natural gas truck—or practically had ever seen one.” Today, Long Island has more than 100 CNG haulers, as municipalities throughout the New York area have followed Smithtown’s lead. Industry leaders say these ordinances—which have also spread nationwide—have stoked demand for natural gas trucks and helped encourage nearly every waste truck maker in America to develop a CNG model. Jeffry Swertfeger of McNeilus Truck and Manufacturing in Minnesota, a leading manufacturer, said his firm began making CNG sanitation trucks in",

    "date": "2011-10-11T19:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand—Fears that New Zealand could face a large-scale environmental crisis have escalated as the oil leaking from the container ship Rena into the sea off the Tauranga coast increased by as much as ten-fold. The news came as the vessel’s remaining crew were evacuated following a mayday alarm amid heavy swells. The New Zealand environment minister, Nick Smith, said the fresh release of oil into the sea meant the Rena spill was the country’s most serious ever maritime environmental disaster. Speaking at a media conference on Tuesday afternoon, he said the consequences had been “inevitable” since the ship ploughed into the Astrolabe reef in calm waters in the North Island Bay of Plenty last Wednesday morning. A new rupture to one of the ship’s main fuel tanks released between 130 and 350 tons of heavy oil into the water, according to officials who conducted a flyover of the freighter. More than 1,600 tons of fuel remain aboard. The fresh damage was caused after the ship’s hull dragged in heavy winds and swells of up to four meters. The continuing movement of the hull has raised fears that the 47,000-ton vessel could break up, triggering an environmental and ecological catastrophe. The mayday alarm and evacuation by helicopter of the remaining crew early on Wednesday added to speculation that the vessel might be close to fracture. Salvage operator Maritime New Zealand was quick to state, however, that the operation was a “standard precautionary measure,” expedited by weather conditions, and there remained “no obvious signs of deformation.” The list of the vessel had in fact corrected from 11 degrees to between three and six degrees, meaning that “the containers have become more stable, as they are now more upright,” it said in a statement. Shortly before 7pm on Tuesday evening, however, the ship tilted again in heavy seas, leaving it listing 15 degrees to starboard, accordingly to a report on TV3 News. The Rena is carrying 1,368 shipping containers, of which at least 22 contain hazardous goods, according to the transport minister, Steve Joyce. Officials have reiterated their instruction for locals to avoid visiting the coastline, where oil has been surfacing since Monday afternoon. A team of about 100 people has begun to clean up the oil from the popular swimming beach at Mount Maunganui, but the current are expected to push the slick at least as far south as Maketu, 20 miles down the coast from Mount Maunganui. Salvage teams suspended the pumping of fuel from the stricken vessel just hours after they began on Tuesday in the face of deteriorating weather, but hope to resume the operation in the coming days, with forecasts suggesting milder conditions. The salvage plan entails three phases: the removal of oil, followed by the removal of containers and finally the flotation of the vessel itself. The operation is expected to last many months. A number of concerns have been raised about the seaworthiness of the Rena. The New Zealand Maritime Union has claimed the vessel’s problems may have included incorrect charts, while Joyce has confirmed that deficiencies had been identified by inspectors in China in July, and again last month in Australia. Maritime New Zealand had inspected the ship at Bluff, in the south island, however, and passed it fit for sail. The Greece-based owners of the ship, Costamare Inc, said in a statement they were “cooperating fully with local authorities and every effort is being made to control and minimise the environmental consequences of this incident.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2011-10-14T08:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—To hard-core environmentalists, the Obama administration’s upcoming decision on the fiercely debated Keystone XL oil sands pipeline is black and white. Say no to the Canada-to-Gulf Coast pipeline, they insist, or they won’t support Obama’s re-election bid. But judging the president’s performance through such a narrow prism could backfire and make these pipeline hardliners politically irrelevant, analysts say, especially when the economy is tanking. “All you hear about now is jobs, jobs, jobs,” Saint Louis University political science professor Ken Warren told InsideClimate News. “And this pipeline is going to be painted as a jobs creation issue. It doesn’t matter how many jobs will actually be created. In politics, it’s about perception. And you’re going to get blasted for not allowing it to be built.” Obama came into office as genuinely pro-environment and promising progress, said Warren, a political analyst and pollster for more than three decades. “Now the greens are putting the squeeze on him,” Warren said, “and Obama is saying, ‘I know, I know, I know but I can’t do what you want me to do with this pipeline. Don’t you understand?'” Evidently not. Claiming it should be a simple decision for Obama, hard-core greens frame the issue like this. Approving the $7 billion project would open a spigot to unneeded dirty fuel and reward the president’s bitterest Big Oil enemies, who are intent on limiting him to one term. Rejecting it, on the other hand, would defuse a “carbon bomb” and reignite the devotion of an increasingly demoralized environmental community that raised piles of money and rounded up disengaged voters to help elect him in",

    "title": "Small Nebraska Town Prepares for Contentious Keystone Pipeline Hearing",
    "date": "2011-09-27T19:02:53-04:00",
    "content": "On Thursday, a team of State Department officials will settle into the high school gymnasium in Atkinson, Neb.—population 1,300—to hear what local folks think about the Keystone XL pipeline. They’re likely to get an earful, not just about the oil pipeline but about the way the State Department has organized the hearing. Public comments will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis, a State Department spokesperson said, just as they’ve been at all the hearings the agency is holding during this final stage of the Keystone XL review process. Each person will have three to five minutes to speak; due to time constraints, only the first 100 or so through the door usually get a chance to make their views heard. But people in Atkinson say they need a different system. They’ve heard that busloads of pipeline supporters will arrive long before the meeting’s 4:30 p.m. start time, to stake out the coveted spots. That puts them at a disadvantage, because many of them are farmers and ranchers who can’t take the day off work to line up early. A spokesman from the American Petroleum Institute confirmed that a coalition of business and labor groups, including API, plans to bus 150 representatives to the meeting. He said all the people are from Nebraska, but they live far from Atkinson and the coalition wants to give them a chance to speak. More than 500 people attended a State Department hearing Monday in Port Arthur, Texas. Most of the 100 speakers were pipeline supporters who talked about job creation and energy security. Another hearing on Monday, in Topeka, Kan., was dominated by environmentalists. Jane Kleeb, executive director of the anti-pipeline group Bold Nebraska, said her group decided not to bus people to the Atkinson meeting because Nebraskans already “overwhelmingly support rerouting the pipeline.” “We have grassroots support; the unions had to bus in their support,” she said, referring to Tuesday’s hearing in Lincoln, Neb., which she attended. Kleeb said she talked to some the union members and found that many of them came from outside of Nebraska. On Thursday, Kleeb and nine other members of Bold Nebraska will attend the Atkinson hearing to help landowners sign in early. “We feel confident that the landowners will be there and ready to speak,” Kleeb said. Atkinson’s chief of police, Tim Larby, is worried about security. He expects 800 to 1,000 people to show up at the high school gym, which can accommodate 1,200. An overflow room with a video feed will be available if the crowd swells. “I cannot control that environment” if there’s a rush at the door, said Larby, who emphasized that he has no opinion on the pipeline and is concerned only about safety. “I’m the one who has to mop it up” if people are unhappy after the hearing, he said. In discussions with State Department representatives, Larby said he suggested using a lottery system to select the speakers. Others think people should be asked to write their names on pro or anti-pipeline lists and speakers chosen alternately from both sides. The State Department spokesperson said it’s too late to change the logistics of the meeting. The first-come, first-serve format was announced two months ago, the spokesperson said, and there were no complaints back then. But the agency will be flexible once the meeting begins, the spokesperson said. If the first 100 people all have the same viewpoint, for example, some could be asked to cede their time so others can speak. Those who don’t get a chance to speak can comment via email, fax or written letters. Fears About the Aquifer Cindy Myers, a nurse who lives 10 miles outside of Atkinson and a couple miles from the proposed pipeline route, is taking Thursday off so she can line up early. Local landowners are desperate to be heard, she said, because they worry that oil from the pipeline could leak into the Ogallala aquifer and contaminate their water wells. Like many landowners, Myers wants the pipeline rerouted out of the sandhills. The water here is so pure that “everyone drinks straight from the aquifer,” she said. The Keystone XL would be the first oil pipeline to run through the Nebraska sandhills, an ecologically sensitive region that overlies the aquifer. In Nebraska, the Ogallala aquifer supplies 78 percent of the water used by residents and industry and 83 percent of the state’s irrigation water. Even Nebraskans who support the pipeline—including Republican Gov. Dave Heineman—have begun urging the State Department to reroute it away from the aquifer. Some are also calling for a special session of the state legislature to propose alternate routes. Atkinson lies near the northern edge of the sandhills. The aquifer here is particularly vulnerable to potential oil spills, said Myers, because the groundwater sometimes bubbles up to the land surface. In the spring “our meadows are so full of water, you sink if you get off the road.” Myers said at least 95 percent of the wells in Holt County, where Atkinson is situated, are privately owned, and that most people can’t afford to test them for contaminants. Nebraska is at the midpoint of the proposed route for the 1,702-mile long pipeline, which would transport tar sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Because the route crosses an international border, the State Department is in charge of approving or denying the presidential permit needed for construction. In August the agency released an environmental impact review that concluded the pipeline would have “no significant impacts” along its route. The State Department is now assessing whether the pipeline is in the best “national interest,” and a final decision is expected before next year. As part of that process, the agency has been holding public hearings in the six pipeline states. The meeting in Atkinson will be the last one in Nebraska. Strength of Opposition Has Surprised Many The groundswell of opposition has taken many by surprise in this rural, Republican-dominated state. “Nebraskans are very reticent, it’s rare to see people rally around something,” said Johnathan Hladik, a native Nebraskan who is an energy policy advocate at the Center for Rural Affairs. The Lyons, Neb. based group advocates for rural issues and economic development. Because rural Nebraska has few economic opportunities aside from farming, Hladik said any threat to the aquifer is a threat to the region’s “lifeblood.” Two recent pipeline spills in the Yellowstone and Kalamazoo Rivers brought home the dangers of pipelines, he said, and there’s growing interest in protecting the sandhills because of opportunities for ecotourism. The fact that another pipeline built by TransCanada, the Alberta-based company that wants to build the Keystone XL, has leaked more than a dozen times since it opened in June",

The EPA is working on plans to limit greenhouse gases from power plants and oil refineries, and it had been targeting releasing some utility-focused proposals on September 30. “Greenhouse gases for power plants is first on the docket,” EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said on the sidelines of an event in San Francisco. “Although we are not going to make the date at the end of the month, we are still working and will be shortly announcing a new schedule.” The EPA also is working on the Mercury Air and Toxics Standards, the first national standards for mercury and acid gases from power plants. “We are still intending to finalize that ruling in November,” she said. A separate set of standards for boiler emissions, called Maximum Achievable Control Technology, have been stayed and the agency plans to announce next steps in October, an agency spokeswoman said.

    "date": "2011-09-12T19:00:26-04:00",
    "content": "For more than a decade, carbon capture and storage technology has been heralded by fossil-fuel industries and many policymakers and scientists as an effective response to the threat of climate change. But the commercialization of CCS—which captures heat-trapping CO2 from smokestacks and pumps it into reservoirs deep underground—still faces enormous financial, technological, political and environmental hurdles. One question that critics want answered is what happens if mass quantities of CO2 leak out and collect in communities’ air or water. Conservationists and health organizations warn that a large release of CO2 could contaminate drinking water supplies, cause asphyxiation or alter pH levels in the blood of residents, which can lead to brain malfunction or death. The industry and other supporters say that natural sequestration events and 20 years of carbon injection by oil companies suggest that CO2 can be trapped underground safely and permanently. A new study from scientists at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, which was partially funded by industry, claims to clear up at least some of that uncertainty. The researchers looked at death rates near natural CO2 seeps in Italy over a 50-year period. They found that people living near the storage sites have a one-in-a-32 million annual chance of dying from contamination. The researchers note in the paper that there is a greater chance of winning the lottery than being killed by natural CO2 releases. “We were really quite surprised to find it had such a low risk,” said Jen Roberts, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh and lead author of the study. The peer-reviewed research, which will be published in this week’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was funded by the Scottish Carbon Capture & Storage consortium, a collection of researchers and companies that study the technology and implementation of CCS, and the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. It is one of the first papers to quantify the health risks of CCS and concludes that “the current public concern regarding death by CO2 leakage from storage sites appears overamplified.” Not everyone agrees. The paper considered death as the only measure of health risk, said Michael McCally, a physician and senior scientist with the nonprofit Physicians for Social Responsibility, who has written about the health risks of CCS. “If the scientists had looked at things like brain damage from non-lethal asphyxiation [caused by overexposure to CO2], I think the risks would have been at least two to three times higher.” Roberts counters that nearly all health issues associated with CO2 poisoning—from the headaches to brain malfunction—are completely reversible once a person starts breathing air with regular, low levels of CO2 again. While the non-lethal records were too incomplete to incorporate, she said she doesn’t think it was imperative to include them. Another unaddressed concern, said McCally, is the potential for CO2 to seep out of the thousands of miles of pipeline that will have to transport the gas to injection sites. “You can’t call CCS safe without looking at all the aspects of the technology.” The physician also questions Roberts and her colleagues’ potential conflicts of interest. The researchers didn’t disclose any conflicts of interest in the paper, and Roberts told InsideClimate News that her and her fellow authors don’t have any. But the consortium’s list of members includes energy giants BP, Shell and BG Group—all of which are developing CCS projects—as well as carbon capture technology companies, including CO2 DeepStore, which develops CCS systems. The companies all invest in the consortium’s research, but according to Roberts, they have no say in the results. “We realize it does look a bit odd, but I’ve never had anyone try and sway my research,” she said. “We do the work and publish the results whether they like what we’ve found or not.” “For me, the questionable conflict of interest brings their conclusions in question,” said McCally. “It makes me think it may be a sneak policy paper.” Assessing Risk of Buried CO2 Carbon dioxide accumulates naturally deep underground when plants and other organic matter decompose within earth’s bedrock. The gas is also created from combustion in volcanoes and from the dissolution of carbonate rocks. Impenetrable rock, like shale, creates a natural carbon seal that prevents the gas from leaking up and out. Occasionally, though, these CO2-rich reservoirs can spring a leak and gas plumes get spewed into the atmosphere. The gas is undetectable by human senses because it is colorless, ordorless and chemically nonreactive at the earth’s surface. If people inhale too much of it, they can experience rapid breathing and headaches. At high enough levels, it can result in brain malfunctioning or death. Industry and governments are looking to store excess CO2 just like nature does it– by trapping it within bedrock thousands of miles below the surface. However, relatively little is known about the long-term stability of artificial CO2 storage—though in pilot sequestration projects in Norway, Algeria and Canada, underground movement of CO2 has so far met the expectations of researchers. And for two decades, the oil industry in the United Sates has been annually injecting millions of tons of CO2 into the ground to get at oil that can’t be extracted by easier methods, with little contamination. Still, recent research has cropped up linking CO2 leaks with toxics in groundwater supplies. The ultimate fear is that there could be a repeat of the",

Using more natural gas for fuel could also produce leaks of methane, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas more than 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, study author Tom Wigley said in a statement. “Relying more on natural gas would reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, but it would do little to help solve the climate problem,” said Wigley, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University of Adelaide in Australia. “It would be many decades before it would slow down global warming at all, and even then it would just be making a difference around the edges,” he said.

The head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City pulls his tan fedora snug around his ears to block the sun and hugs his knees to his chest. Then he opens his mouth to harmonize with a chorus of 160-plus voices blending on chants that included “Heal the Planet,” “Stand Together,” “Not in Our Name” and “Keep Your Promises.” Hansen is the center of attention on day 10 of a two-week peaceful sit-in to protest a Canadian company’s proposal to construct a $7 billion, 1,702-mile pipeline to pump diluted bitumen—a particularly dirty type of heavy crude—from the oil sands mines of Alberta to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast. At 1:20 p.m., a U.S. Park Police officer beckons to the suit-clad Hansen with his index finger. The 70-year-old grandfather arises to cheers and applause from the fellow 30 or so demonstrators still left on the sidewalk and the hundred-plus still singing, hollering and strumming a guitar across the street in Lafayette Park. Hansen—the 112th of the 140 arrested Monday, many from the faith community—extends his hands behind his back so the police officer can cinch the black plastic handcuffs around his wrists. Then, he stands with his brown dress shoes spread several feet apart while another officer frisks him. At least a dozen photographers document the scene. Five minutes later, Hansen emerges from a white tarpaulin where his mug shot was snapped. Somebody yelled “Thank you, Jim.” As Hansen holds his fedora aloft and cracks a smile, protesters in the park break into a verse of “We love Jim Hansen” and “Don’t want no pipeline” to the tune of the traditional gospel song “Down by the Riverside.” Then he ducks, climbs into the awaiting paddy wagon and disappears. Hansen—who has been arrested a couple of times before for protesting the harvesting of fossil fuels—regularly criticizes the Keystone XL pipeline as the “fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet.” The Obama administration is expected to issue a decision on the international project by the end of the year. A magnitude-5.8-magnitude, Virginia-centered earthquake last Tuesday and the force of Hurricane Irene’s bluster Saturday and Sunday have not deterred the protesters, who are affiliated with a grass-roots movement called Tar Sands Action. To date, 521 participants have been arrested, according to police and organizer records. Monday was an uncharacteristically humidity-free August day in the nation’s capital with temperatures hovering near 80. At a pre-arrest rally in the park, Hansen reminded the boisterous crowd of then-Sen. Barack Obama’s victory speech in November",

    "title": "Amid EV Hype, Backers of Natural Gas Cars Vie for Federal Support",
    "date": "2011-09-01T13:00:53-04:00",
    "content": "Electric vehicles are on a roll, with charging stations popping up in cities nationwide, federal subsidies for car buyers and much anticipation around the rollout of new cars. But proponents of another type of vehicle say they are quietly laying the groundwork for an alternative to the electric car, and they wish they were getting more attention and federal support. Vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel emit about a quarter less carbon dioxide than gasoline engines and very low levels of compounds harmful to public health. Filling up on natural gas currently costs about one fourth to one half as much as traditional gasoline per mile driven. Fueling a natural gas vehicle can take only five to 10 minutes, compared to up to eight hours to recharge an electric car, and vehicles can go much farther on a tank of CNG than an electric battery. So natural gas companies and other proponents—including energy mogul T. Boone Pickens—are calling for a “level playing field” in terms of government subsidies and urging consumers and automakers to consider natural gas vehicles. But while the fuel for CNG vehicles may be cheap, the infrastructure is not. It can cost more than $1 million to install a commercial natural gas fueling station, whereas an electric car can plug into a standard household outlet. Even a 480-volt fast-charging station, which can charge a Nissan Leaf’s battery in under an hour, costs about $20,000. A handful of cities, including Oklahoma City, Shreveport, Salt Lake City, San Diego and Los Angeles have enough CNG fueling stations to allow residents to dependably drive a natural gas vehicle around town. But many major cities and large swaths of the country lack public natural gas fueling stations. There are about 1,000 natural gas fueling stations nationwide, according to industry sources, with 40 to 50 percent of them available to the public. The website carstations.com lists about 1,350 public electric vehicle charging stations nationwide, though many cities and private companies have more in the works. There is only one consumer vehicle on the market that runs solely on natural gas—the Honda Civic GX. It costs about $25,000, comparable to the all-electric Nissan Leaf, which the company advertises at $27,700 after incentives. Many cars can be converted to run on both natural gas and traditional gasoline, and natural gas proponents say these are becoming increasingly popular with consumers. However, only certain vehicles— mostly American-made pickups and SUVs—can be legally converted, and the aftermarket conversions can cost around $10,000-$12,000. Government Support The federal government and many state and municipal governments have offered or currently offer significant subsidies for electric vehicles, including state and federal tax breaks for buying electric vehicles and installing charging stations. Many city governments are also installing free charging stations and purchasing electric vehicles for city agencies. Little federal support exists for natural gas vehicles. A $30,000 federal tax break for fueling stations expires at the end of the year, and given the cost of stations, proponents say it is relatively insignificant. Some state governments are heavily backing natural gas vehicles, however. Oklahoma and Louisiana offer tax breaks that cover up to 50 percent of the cost of fueling stations or the purchase or conversion of natural gas vehicles, and other state governments are considering such measures. Many state alternative fuel incentives cover natural gas and electric vehicles equally. Various municipalities have also converted part or all of their fleets of transit buses, garbage trucks and other heavy vehicles to CNG, as have private companies including United Parcel Service, AT&T and Waste Management. “They say they are doing it for environmental reasons, but when it comes down to it it’s really economic,” said David Hill, vice president of natural gas economy for Encana, the Denver-based natural gas company. Economies of scale mean it is more efficient for owners of numerous large vehicles to invest in the technology and their own fueling stations, since the more fuel they use the more quickly they can recoup their investment. The cost of filling a vehicle with CNG varies by location, as low as 78 cents for the mileage equivalent of a gallon of gasoline in Oklahoma City and around $2.50 in the Chicago area. Expanding Infrastructure Kathryn Clay represents natural gas producers and distributors as executive director of the joint American Gas Association and America’s Natural Gas Alliance (AGA-ANGA). She also formerly specialized in electric vehicles in her role as vice president of research and technology policy for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and also working for U.S. Senate and House committees on energy and alternative fuels. Clay sees natural gas vehicles becoming increasingly common in the next decade as more natural gas stations are set up to fuel long-haul trucks and even barges. Tractor-trailer trucks can efficiently burn liquefied natural gas (LNG), which involves separate fueling stations and which is not considered an option for smaller vehicles since it is more expensive to produce and has to be kept cold—to maintain its liquid state—in cryogenic tanks. But Clay said it makes sense to build LNG and CNG stations in tandem. She sees such stations on trucking or shipping routes as forming a “trunk” of natural gas fueling stations, increasing the motivation for other companies to build stations on “branches” near those routes. Natural gas industry leaders, including Encana and Oklahoma-based Chesapeake, are in the process of converting their own fleets to natural gas, building their own fueling stations and making the stations available to the public in an effort to build consumer interest. Chesapeake has converted all its light-duty trucks to natural gas and plans to convert about 5,000 vehicles within the next five years, according to director of market development Norman Herrera. Encana has built one station north of Denver, one in Shreveport, two in Canada and it has one under construction in Wyoming. The company also worked with the city of Grand Junction, Colorado, to build two fueling stations there. “We’re building in the communities we’re operating in, so government fleets and the public can have access to fueling stations,” said Hill. He noted that the company also plans to convert its drilling rigs to operate on natural gas—currently 15 of their North American rigs do so. Natural gas companies have also invested in or partnered with convenience stores and other gas stations to add natural gas fueling stations—a proposition which isn’t always easy since the infrastructure takes up a lot of space. Chesapeake has helped create 14 public fueling stations in Oklahoma and is planning more in other states, according to Herrera, who drives a bi-fuel Chevy Tahoe that runs on both gasoline and natural gas. Also, natural gas companies note that when a home is already heated with natural gas, it is relatively simple to install an at-home fueling station for a vehicle. The price of natural gas has plummeted in recent years because vast new deposits have become accessible because of new hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) techniques. While environmentalists and others criticize the process as potentially harmful to water supplies, natural gas industry spokespeople maintain that fracking is generally environmentally safe when done right, and they also point to the environmental issues involved with extracting oil for traditional gasoline and coal, which provides about half the nation’s electricity. ‘There’s Room for All of Us’ Natural gas vehicles are much more popular outside the U.S., with about 13 million in operation worldwide. In the U.S. there are about 110,000 to 125,000 natural gas vehicles on the roads, the majority of them buses, garbage trucks and other large vehicles in government or private fleets. Proponents say that natural gas vehicles should be getting as much government support as electric vehicles. “You want to have parity in alternative vehicles,” said Herrera. “You want both fuels to be to be treated equally.” A House bill introduced last spring, the New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions (NAT GAS) Act, would create incentives for natural gas vehicles, including increasing the tax break for fueling stations more than three-fold to $100,000 and offering incentives for purchasing natural gas and bi-fuel natural gas vehicles. It would provide tax credits of up to $7,500 for light duty passenger vehicles and up to $64,000 for heavy trucks. But Clay said that given the lower price of natural gas, even without government support she thinks some consumers will eventually think it is worth their while to buy natural gas vehicles. “The market will decide, and it will naturally segment,” said Clay, whose doctorate focused on the physics of battery technology. “Given today’s technology it’s going to be challenging to design a battery that can go 100 miles on one charge. Where range is important, natural gas would clearly have an advantage. In urban areas, maybe more people will go electric.” Hill said he’d like to see more and equal subsidies for various types of alternative vehicles including propane, hydrogen and biofuel in addition to natural gas and electric. “We need a portfolio of different fuels for different applications,” he said. “There’s room for all of us and we have room to grow.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Oil Sands Pipeline Won’t Wreck Environment: U.S. State Department",
    "date": "2011-08-26T20:30:00-04:00",
    "content": "A proposed $7 billion Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline cleared a major obstacle on Friday with the release of a U.S. State Department review that suggested it would do little damage to the environment. The review concluded the Keystone XL pipeline would not lead to a big boost in Alberta’s oil sands production, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide when produced. “Even without it .. .the oil is going to develop and is going to get to different refineries that are demanding it,” a State Department official said. The review said the oil would get to markets by barge, rail, and other pipelines if the Keystone XL was not built. The TransCanada Corp. pipeline would bring more than 500,000 barrels per day of oil sands crude from Alberta to refineries in Texas. Environmentalists rejected the department’s assessment and said they will continue efforts to block the project. More than 320 protesters of the pipeline have been arrested this week in demonstrations in front of the White House in an action expected to continue into early September. Opponents want President Barack Obama to block the line, arguing the oil could slow the drive to electrify vehicles. Critics, which include some U.S. Senators, also say the pipeline risks polluting a massive aquifer in the center of the United States. TransCanada’s existing Keystone pipeline suffered two small leaks this year. Backers say the pipeline will create thousands of jobs and boost oil imports from a close ally. Besides being a major project for TransCanada, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper sees it as pivotal in a national energy strategy to maximize production of the tar sands, the world’s third largest crude deposit. The Canadian and Alberta governments have lobbied hard in Washington to sell the benefits of the project, which they tout as way to reduce dependence on OPEC and to create jobs.The oil industry believes the increased access to the huge Gulf Coast refining market would raise prices for oil sands-derived crude, which are depressed by a glut of crude in the U.S. Midcontinent region. Lou Pugliaresi, president of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said the department’s review was a positive step toward the embattled project receiving the greenlight from the State Department. “I’m guessing it will be approved because of the large energy security and economic benefits and the fact that most of the environmental issues have been dealt with,” Pugliaresi said. National Interest The State Department will hold a series of meetings beginning late next month in the five states the pipeline would pass through before making a final decision on the line. The State Department also will begin to assess whether the pipeline is in the “national interest” of the United States. With the construction and maintenance jobs the pipeline would bring and the potential of the line to reduce oil imports from countries that are not always friendly to Washington, supporters of project hope the review will not be a major hurdle. “Through the Keystone system, the U.S. can secure access to a stable and reliable supply of oil from Canada where we protect human rights and the environment, or it can import more higher-priced oil from nations who do not share America’s interests or values,” Russ Girling, TransCanada’s chief executive, said in a statement after the review. Girling hopes the line will be built by",

    "content": "WASHINGTON—Close to noon Tuesday, frustrated tourist Ron Higgins of Los Angeles tries to maneuver a classic, dead-on shot of the north side of the White House with his digital camera. But he isn’t having much luck. U.S. Park Police officers have erected metal barriers entwined with yellow caution tape to cordon off most of the prime real estate—a wide swath of the sidewalk and abutting roadway—to accommodate demonstrators chanting anti-oil sands slogans and displaying banners in front of the iron fence surrounding Pres. Obama’s home. “They say this protest is about a pipeline,” says Higgins, visiting the nation’s capital with this family before dropping off son Ryan at Virginia’s Hampton University. “I don’t know what pipeline they’re talking about. I just want my son to see the White House.” In a nutshell, that unawareness is what activist Bill McKibben and his loyalists with Tar Sands Action are up against. The Vermont author, Middlebury College professor and founder of the advocacy organization 350.org has instigated a summer sit-in geared at halting the flow of a particularly dirty and corrosive type of heavy crude from Canada to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Higgins, however, is likely representative of most Americans. He’s never heard of TransCanada’s proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Climate change is not a top-of-the agenda worry for him. And while he doesn’t begrudge activists a chance to speak up at the White House, the connection between harvesting diluted bitumen in the province of Alberta and warming the entire planet just doesn’t resonate with him. Undoubtedly, it’s difficult for anybody to energize the masses about global warming in these seemingly post-climate times. Congress has brushed it aside, many Republican presidential candidates dismiss the science and much of the fractured media is asleep at the climate wheel. Despite that malaise, McKibben is intent on connecting the dots between Keystone XL—a $7 billion, 1,702-mile pipeline that a Canadian company wants to bury beneath six states in the nation’s heartland—and its designation as a gargantuan carbon bomb. Due to the international nature of the project, the State Department is tasked with granting the final “yes” or “no.” Department authorities are scheduled to release a final environmental evaluation of the project any day now. Ultimately, McKibben says, the pipeline decision is up to Obama. His peaceful protest is designed to hold the president accountable for his promises to wean the nation of foreign oil. “This is a movement and a moment,” he tells SolveClimate News in an interview. “We’ll see if Barack Obama seizes it.” Why The Protesters Came Since the two-week sit-in began Saturday, hundreds more participants have registered to join the 2,000-plus who initially signed up to take civil disobedience training before risking arrest on the sidewalk in front of the White House. On Tuesday morning, District of Columbia native Sarah Fahy, a 79-year-old nun, speaks about how thrilled she is to be mingling with an array of college students, professionals and grandparents gathered for a pre-protest pep talk and warm-up on the staging grounds of Lafayette Park across from the White House. They practice chants amid handmade signs as straightforward as “Stop Investing in Fossils” and as provocative as “Yes B.O. You Can Say No” to “God Is Still Speaking: Save My Creation.” “I came because it’s so important to raise this issue as strongly as we can,” explains Fahy, who has telephone numbers of the protesters’ legal counsel emblazoned with black Sharpie ink on her arm and hands. “I was born in",

    "date": "2011-08-12T11:00:43-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—A series of headline-grabbing ruptures along the nation’s 2.5 million-mile network of oil and gas pipelines is prompting a rare attempt at bipartisanship. Democrats and Republicans seem equally intent on significantly beefing up the pipeline safety standards that might have prevented some of these spills. The timing of the legislation they’re considering is especially vital because the State Department is in the midst of deciding whether a Canadian company should be allowed to expand its U.S. presence by building a $7 billion pipeline through the Ogallala Aquifer and other fragile landscapes in the nation’s heartland. TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline would pump millions of gallons of diluted bitumen —a particularly dirty grade of heavy crude — 1,702 miles from the oil sands mines of Alberta to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Three bills — two Democratic measures in the Senate and one cross-party initiative in the House — are now circulating. All of them would give federal regulators a bigger hammer to prevent pipeline leaks and accidents. Provisions include studying how diluted bitumen affects a pipeline’s structural integrity, improving leak detection technology, increasing inspections, requiring steeper penalties for violations and mandating advances such as automatic shutoff valves and excess flow valves. One unusual development is that industry groups and environmental and public interest advocates seem heartened by what they are hearing and seeing on the legislative front. The Pipeline Safety Trust, a Bellingham, Wash.-based nonprofit whose sole mission is promoting fuel transportation safety, is also satisfied with where Congress is headed. The Trust’s executive director, Carl Weimer, and others from his organization have spent hours testifying before congressional committees. “Before the rash of pipeline tragedies in the last 15 months, we’d be happy to have three of the 12 items on our laundry list in a bill,” Weimer told SolveClimate News. “But this time around we’ve got most everything on our list in these bills. “We’re kind of surprised. We thought Sen. Frank Lautenberg’s bill would be the high-water mark and things would go downhill in the House,” he said, referring to the first bill introduced this session. “But in reality, by the time they got done with the House bill, in some ways it is stronger than the Senate bill.” Weimer says that a muscular law could emerge relatively quickly if another anticipated House bill doesn’t gum up the process — as it well could — and if legislators are judicious enough to combine the strongest pieces from each bill. A Brief Look at the Bills Lautenberg of New Jersey teamed up with fellow Democrat Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia in February to introduce the Pipeline Transportation Safety Improvement Act of",

    "date": "2011-08-10T17:00:48-04:00",
    "content": "Includes correction Social media expert Patrick Crane had just stepped down for a “career break” after four years with networking giant LinkedIn when Sungevity came knocking late last year with a job offer. Still far from decided but intrigued, Crane agreed to sign up with the Oakland, Calif.-based solar leasing firm — but just as a customer. He filled out a free online Sungevity iQuote, punching in his roof specifics, electricity usage and other household details. In less than 24 hours, the company calculated the roof’s pitch and orientation to the sun and emailed Crane a design of his solar array without ever stepping foot in his San Francisco Bay Area home. The quote tallied how much money the panels would save on electricity bills. And it stated that, at no cost to Crane, he could lease an installation from Sungevity, skipping out on tens of thousands of dollars in upfront costs. Looking over the proposal led to an “aha” moment for Crane. Going solar seemed like a transformative choice, he told SolveClimate News in an interview, and he wanted to talk about it far and wide. For a social networking guy, that was huge. “I felt in my bones that solar is a social phenomenon,” Crane said. “What I saw very quickly through my own experience was that families are making a very big emotional decision. “Solar is not a bunch of black panels on a roof,” he continued. “Solar is a lifestyle.” That was in January. One month later Crane signed on to be Sungevity’s chief marketing officer, and in that same week in February his real-life rooftop array was first connected to the grid. “Being that wowed … by the customer experience was the impetus to say, ‘This is what I want to do with my life for the next few years,'” Crane said. He said he hopes to bring to Sungevity and the fledgling solar industry the same skills he brought to one of the biggest social networks in the world. (Paragraph includes correction added on 08/10/",

An activist who became a hero to campaigners for disrupting a Bush administration auction for the oil and gas industry with $1.8 million in bogus bids was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday. Tim DeChristopher was immediately ordered into custody, and fined $10,000. He had been facing a potential sentence of up to 10 years and a $750,000 fine. Environmental campaigners and activists, from actress Daryl Hannah to film maker Michael Moore and writer Naomi Klein, immediately denounced the sentence as excessive. At a vigil outside the Salt Lake City courtroom where sentencing took place, supporters of DeChristopher’s Peaceful Uprising civil disobedience movement shouted: “Justice is not found here.” As Bidder No. 70, DeChristopher disrupted what was seen as a last giveaway to the oil and gas industry by the Bush administration by bidding $1.8 million he did not have for the right to drill in remote areas of Utah. He was convicted of defrauding the government last March. In a phone conversation with The Guardian, a day ahead of sentencing, he said he was expecting jail time: “I do think I will serve some time in prison.

Standing in elevated muck on a recent steamy summer’s afternoon, he gestures toward a tidal creek running along an isolated spit of road. “At high tide here, we would be ankle deep in water,” says Hurley, an estuarine ecologist at Georgia’s Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. He snaps off the end of a dead cordgrass blossom and looks east long enough to notice that the tide has turned. In a few hours time, this tidal bank will again be inundated, but never for more than an hour or so each day. Once the tide rolls in, striped mullet feed on decaying cordgrass on the marsh’s soggy bottom. Like the tides on which these estuaries depend, Georgia’s 100-mile coastline has waxed and waned for thousands of years, surviving by shifting miles in the process. And it’s doing so once more; again driven by warming oceans and melting glaciers. Mention “global warming” in this part of the world and most people’s eyes will glaze over. Sea level rise, however, has tangibility that residents here experience with every high tide. But that doesn’t mean they’ve thought about how global sea level rise will impact them personally. In a recession-weary economy heavily dependent on tourism, real estate and the fishing industry, sea level rise hasn’t exactly hit the top of the charts — yet. The state’s susceptibility to sea level rise is a function of the lay of the land. Because Georgia lies on a low continental slope, ecologists say that salt marsh loss is expected to be quite significant, both in terms of the area lost, and in reduced habitat for economically important local fisheries, such as shrimp, oysters and blue crabs.

    "content": "Rising ocean temperatures due to global warming have already been linked to coral reef deaths, destructive storms, shifting species distributions and harmful algal blooms. Now, a team of Australian researchers is adding a new and similarly daunting concern to that list: the spread of disease in “habitat-forming” seaweeds that are critical to marine health. Scientists fear that the widespread loss of these seaweeds could have disastrous effects on creatures that rely on them for food and protection, such as sea hares, sea urchins and dozens of fish and invertebrate species. “Seaweeds are the ‘trees’ of coastal temperate systems,” said Peter Steinberg, a marine biologist at the University of New South Wales and director of the Sydney Institute of Marine Science, who helped lead the research that was published in the journal Global Change Biology last month. “They provide the food and habitat for many of the other organisms that live there. Without them, these systems are radically different,” he said. Earlier studies documented rapid decline and disease in seaweeds during the past two decades, but this analysis was the first to examine whether climate change is driving illness in habitat-forming stands that provide life to vast numbers of marine organisms.

    "title": "Predicting Climate ‘Tipping Points’ Within Reach, Study Suggests",
    "date": "2011-07-15T15:00:23-04:00",
    "content": "After several years of identifying possible climatic “tipping points” such as the meltdown of the West Antarctic ice sheet and widespread tree deaths in the Canadian boreal forest, scientists are beginning to take on another formidable challenge: predicting these potential threats before they occur. While the mathematical concepts for understanding tipping point signals have been around for decades, they are just beginning to be incorporated into global climate data and models, according to new research published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The paper’s author, Timothy Lenton, said his study suggests that early warning of some impending tipping points may already be possible. “[This is the] first time a synthesis of both the basic theory and the latest results on the early warning signals has been brought together,” Lenton said in an interview with SolveClimate News. “I think it’s the first time anyone’s made the link to how you might translate them to an early warning system.” A tipping point is a threshold at which change suddenly becomes unstoppable and irreversible without drastic action, said Simon Levin, a professor of biology at Princeton University, who uses applied mathematics in his research. A small shift, he warned, can push the climate system over the edge and trigger calamities, such as a dangerous rise in sea levels from Greenland’s ice melt or an Arctic thaw, which would release massive stores of methane into the atmosphere. Lenton, a professor of earth system science at the University of Exeter, wrote in his paper that the probability of passing a climate tipping point is still seen by scientists as low. But, he said, the likelihood is increasing all the time as global warming continues largely unchecked. One such tipping point is the potential collapse of the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation, Lenton said. Called the Atlantic THC for short, the thermohaline circulation links the tropical oceans to the North Atlantic. It is created when cold water near the pole sinks and travels south, while warm water from the tropics flows north. The circulation depends on the sinking of cold, dense water at high latitudes, but rising ocean temperatures due to climate change and the input of fresh meltwater from Greenland are making the water less cold and dense. As a result, the strength of the THC could weaken over time. Lenton said he has reviewed climate models that show the THC slowing down or stopping completely in future decades, which would create weather havoc in Europe. The THC warms Europe up during the winter months. If it hits its tipping point and shuts down altogether, England and Scandinavia would face more extreme cold in the winters, said Samuel Levis, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). This while the region still suffers climate-induced extreme heat events in the summer. Several climate models revealed the presence of warning signals as the THC neared its tipping point. One of these models, GENIE-2, is a complex computer simulation that Lenton helped design. GENIE-2 incorporates a dynamic atmosphere connected to the ocean, said Lenton, making it a more realistic representation of reality. In a previous paper, researchers ran the GENIE-2 model by forcing freshwater into the system until the THC slowed and stopped. Before it reached the tipping point, scientists found that the system became “sluggish” — or slow to recover from mild changes — explained Lenton. An extra “nudge” from the atmosphere in the form of heavy rainfall in the North Atlantic, for example, temporarily weakened the circulation, as expected. But as the system approached the tipping point the circulation took longer to recover from the nudge. These results have already been published, explained Lenton. “What hasn’t been done before is a careful assessment of how robust the results are.” In his new paper, Lenton showed the findings are sound by running the early warning methods thousands of times with different statistical parameters. The sluggishness is important, Lenton said, because it’s a classic sign that a system is nearing the tipping point. “I’m making an argument from almost a mathematical point of view that these are general properties of tipping points,” he said, adding that he hopes scientists will continue to look for such signs in both climate models and real data. In another research paper currently in press, Lenton and his colleagues found similar signs of sluggishness in paleoclimate records. Ten thousand years ago, Earth’s climate was in a colder period known as the Younger Dryas. The switch to the warmer Holocene — today’s climate — happened quickly. The scientists used sediment cores to study the productivity of marine organisms living on the surface of the tropical Atlantic. Right before the switch into the Holocene, they found that these ecosystems became slower to recover from changes, such as from sudden fluctuations in ocean circulation. Lenton is also working on new research that shows warning signals for Arctic sea ice melt. The paper has yet to the published. Long Way to Go Lenton emphasized that climate scientists still have a long way to go before they can accurately predict many tipping points. Certain events such as the accelerated melting of Greenland are just starting to be fully incorporated into climate models. Others, like the West African monsoon, he said, are “notoriously difficult” to model. These seasonal monsoons begin along the West African coast before jumping inland. Because many societies are dependant on the predictability of these rains for farming, any change in the monsoon’s strength or location could threaten regional food security. It’s uncertain how the monsoon will change in a warming world, said Levis, the project scientist at NCAR. Certain climate models show the monsoon shifting in one direction, while other models indicate it moving in another direction entirely. “So how do you pick out the tipping point if there’s no agreement between models?” he asked rhetorically. In some cases, it may already be too late to use statistics-based warning signals, experts say. In the boreal forest of British Columbia, Canada, for instance, mild winters have encouraged the proliferation of mountain pine beetles, which have already killed a vast number of lodgepole pines. The die-off of trees, combined with the warming trend and increased wildfires, could force a large-scale collapse of the forest ecosystem, Lenton said. If conditions become too hot and dry for the return of lodgepole pines, the environment could turn into a future grassland. One way to examine whether the system is headed for a tipping point is to wait for the infestation to die down and then compare the forest’s recovery with other forest disease outbreaks, said Lenton. The problem, he said, is that the current pine beetle invasion shows no sign of slacking off. He suggested that it might be best to interpret the current beetle outbreak as a possible warning that we may be facing a large-scale collapse of the boreal forest. Prioritze Tipping Points In addition to conducting more basic research, Lenton said it is important for scientists to prioritize tipping points that pose the greatest risk. The level of risk is determined by the likelihood of an event taking place and the potential severity of its impact, he said. Greenland, for instance, rates relatively high on both fronts. As the ice melts, liquid water runs like a waterfall onto the interface between ice and rock, said Levis. The fear is that the water will lubricate the surface and facilitate chunks of ice falling into the sea. “So, this would be considered a tipping point, it and would also accelerate sea level rise,” he said. On the other hand, there’s less of a likelihood that the West African monsoon tipping point will occur, experts say. However, if it were to happen, the destruction to societies would be high. Scientists are still refining the West African monsoon’s behavior in climate models, Lenton said, so it’s hard to pin down a threshold. This might be a situation that reaches the tipping point without detectable warning, he added. In some cases it’s unclear if a threshold exists at all. Eric Wood, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton University, said he considers the release of carbon dioxide from the world’s peatlands as a potential tipping point. Warming could trigger a catastrophic outburst of the heat-trapping gas, he said. Lenton, however, believes the release would happen more gradually — but he supports continued research on the peatlands. “There are systems out there that I haven’t put on my list,” he said. For the tipping points that do exist, Lenton predicts there will be “false alarms and missed alarms” as scientists work to decipher early warning signals. “[It’s] worth it despite the mistakes,” said Lenton. “The paper presents ways to take the mathematical ideas into practicality … if early warnings are possible, we should try to find them.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "When it comes to reporting on climate change, European media are from hothouse Venus, and their American counterparts are from considerably more frigid Mars. The divide between them may be having a profound impact on climate and energy policy in either part of the world. European journalists accuse their American counterparts of maintaining a false balance in their reporting, pretending climate science is still in doubt, and offering politicians cover for inaction. But while that may have been true just a few years ago, it is changing now, say American editors. For Peter Vandermeersch, editor-in chief at the traditionally conservative daily NRC Handelsblad in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, there is no debate about climate change. “Absolutely, that’s a given,” he said. “The conviction has grown that climate change does exist, and that humans play a major role in how it evolves.” “There’s almost no discussion about it,” agreed Wouter Verschelden, editor-in-chief at the progressive daily De Morgen in Brussels, Belgium. “The nonbelievers have been marginalized, and they aren’t taken seriously anymore. We don’t have to convince our readers anymore of the fact that there is climate change, and that it’s caused by humans.” ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism According to Vandermeersch and Verschelden, who are both alumni of Columbia University’s vaunted Journalism School in New York, American news media still make the mistake of giving climate skeptics a disproportionate voice and perpetuating a debate that has long been settled among scientists. “In a sense, you’re lying to your readers,” says Verschelden. “You’re creating a ‘he said, she said’ story, and looking for an argument that just doesn’t always exist.” “Journalism in",

    "title": "Climate Change Threatens Southwest’s Iconic Joshua Trees",
    "date": "2011-07-03T14:00:31-04:00",
    "content": "Three hours east of Malibu, the Pacific Coast Highway and everything that is L.A., a small multitude of Joshua trees stand sentinel over a desolate corner of Mojave high desert. They look as if they’ve been on this incredibly arid, lonely hillslope forever. But, trouble is, will they still be here tomorrow? Research ecologists are still trying to answer just how climate change will affect the Joshua tree’s numbers, range and habitat. They do know that over the millenia, the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) has evolved to thrive in the dry and hot Southwestern desert conditions and barren soils that a less specialized plant species could not tolerate. Now, two recent papers detailing future climate scenarios for Joshua Tree National Park and the Joshua tree’s natural range are projecting tough times for this venerable Southwest icon. The first study, published in the January issue of the journal “Ecological Applications,” detailed climate models that project that the Joshua tree may see its current range of southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, western Arizona, and southeastern California reduced by as much as 90 percent within a 60 to 90-year timeframe. “We’re not saying that 90 percent of them will die,” said Ken Cole, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Flagstaff and the paper’s lead author. “The established ones may persist for 150 years. We’re saying that within 90 percent of its current range, they will be unable to reproduce or unable to survive [long-term].” Kirsten Ironside, a landscape ecologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and the paper’s second author, said that as existing trees eventually die, they are very unlikely to be replaced. Although their average lifespans are thought to range from 100 to 200 years, individual adults may live up to 300 years or more, while reaching heights of more than 50 feet. “It’s already gotten too warm and dry for it to prosper at Joshua Tree National Park,” said Cole. “So, its natural range is moving a couple of hundred miles north, due to a combination of [higher] temperatures and [decreased] moisture.” At the end of the last Ice Age, some 13,000 years ago, the trees are thought to have ranged as far south as the present day U.S.-Mexico border and as far north as southern Nevada. As the climate warmed, Cole said the tree’s southern range underwent a substantial contraction. As for trees within the 794,000-acre National Park today, Cameron Barrows, a research ecologist at the University of California at Riverside, said there is likely going to be an 80 to 90 percent reduction of Joshua trees within the same time frame as Cole’s projections. But Barrows is confident that at least some pockets of trees will persist long-term within the park boundaries. “Our analysis indicates there are going to be primary climate refugia in some of the higher elevation valleys and canyons capable of sustaining Joshua trees within the foreseeable future,” said Barrows, who, with colleagues, modeled the plant’s current distribution within the park for a paper being submitted to a research journal. In a search of the park for signs of Joshua tree reproduction, Barrows, his colleagues and volunteers sighted about 900 seedlings — 120 of which were estimated to be less than 10-years-old. While Cole’s current projections for Joshua tree reproduction inside the park remain pessimistic, Barrows said it’s difficult to compare how the tree’s current rates of reproduction stack up against historical rates. Even so, Josh Hoines, chief of the Vegetation Branch at Joshua Tree National Park, said he also tends to be more optimistic than Cole’s projections because estimates indicate at least 10 percent of the trees here are still reproducing. At a distance of a couple of hundred yards, these “trees” have trunks that could pass for under-watered oak or pecan. But upon closer inspection here inside Joshua Tree National Park it’s readily apparent that Joshua trees aren’t trees at all. They are extremely hardy specimens of the Lily family. They root themselves in coarse, nutrient-deficient soil made up of decomposed granite. When this desert sees rainfall, which is primarily during the winter months, the plant’s deep and extensive root network quickly soaks up the moisture, storing it internally. But since their pulp doesn’t form annual tree rings, there is no sure way to age them. In fact, the Joshua tree’s exact beginnings as a species remain a mystery. Scientists can learn about Joshua tree history mostly from packrat middens, the complex houses built by packrats (woodrats) from found materials like twigs and cacti. “All of the fossil evidence for the Joshua tree comes from fossil packrat middens, preserved in caves and rock shelters,” said Julio Betancourt, a USGS environmental scientist in Tucson. “The species could have evolved a million years ago but can’t be dated beyond 50,000 years ago.” Can Joshua Trees Reproduce in a Warming World? Researchers know that the Joshua tree’s evolution and dispersal was helped along by both a tiny moth and a long-extinct giant sloth. As part of their lifecycle, the female Yucca moth pollinate and then lay eggs in the Joshua tree’s flowers. Hoines opens one of the Joshua tree’s seedpods and points to a small white larva wriggling inside. Since the moth and Joshua tree are a prime example of interspecies symbiosis, it’s startling to see moth larvae literally eating away at the Joshua tree’s lifeblood. “When the larvae hatch, they eat their way out through the seed pods and fly away,” he said. But the moth larvae are estimated to destroy less than 10 percent of all Joshua tree seeds. The Joshua tree’s reproductive structure is unique in that it requires a moth with just the right length egg-laying organ — called an “ovipositor” — in order to lay its eggs within the tree’s flowers. It’s a mutually beneficial relationship. The Joshua tree gets pollinated, and in return the moth has food for its young. Although the Joshua tree has very limited self-pollination, it’s not very efficient, and so the moth allows the tree to reproduce efficiently; in fact, the two species have co-evolved to do so. But climate change may throw a wrench in such a carefully calibrated relationship. Barrows said the issue is that we don’t know whether temperature changes will have the same effect on the moth pollinators as it will on the plants themselves. If they both have the same reaction to higher temperatures, then the impact will be minimal. But if one is more sensitive than the other, then they could be out of step and trees could flower without the moths around to pollinate them. But Cole’s primary concern is that climate change is happening so abruptly that the trees won’t be able to disperse themselves into more suitable areas fast enough to sustain themselves. “The Joshua tree’s problem is with migration,” said Cole. “It takes a long time to grow and doesn’t invade disturbed areas easily.” Betancourt said that the ability for a species to migrate fast enough to keep up with a changing climate hinges on its capacity to disperse its seeds to suitable places to grow that may be far away. One theory about why the Joshua tree’s southern range shrunk so much at the end of the last Ice Age centers on its ability to disperse its seeds. According to this theory, the large Shasta ground sloth, which lived across Southwestern North America during the Ice Age, would excrete the seeds after ingestion. Cole contends that once large plant-eating creatures like the sloth died off some 13,000 years ago, then not only was the Joshua tree’s habitat curtailed by a warming climate, but it also lost its prime method of spreading seeds over long distances. Today, the antelope ground squirrel is one of the Joshua tree’s prime seed dispersers. It’s just one of the many species that use the Joshua tree for food, shelter or both — ranging from ground squirrels and jackrabbits to night lizards and lowly mice, as well as some 25 species of birds. Some of these species move the Joshua tree’s seeds in a similar manner as the sloth did, but most don’t spread them nearly as far and wide. Barrows said that if the Joshua tree were to disappear altogether, the diversity of species within the National Park would certainly be diminished. Whether that domino effect would continue down the food web is hard to know, he said. Fortunately, the Joshua tree’s large, hard-coated seeds are well suited for long-term storage. To that end, Hoines said the park is actively collecting its seeds on site, in case they’re eventually needed to restore the species. But Betancourt is more guarded about making future pronouncements. “Despite the fact that we named a National Park after them,” he said, “we know very little about Joshua tree biology that is useful in predicting their fate under climate change.” Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "content": "The development of new renewable energy technologies and other expanding sources of energy such as shale gas will be limited by the availability of water in some regions of the world, according to research by a U.S. think tank. The study shows the reliance on large amounts of water to create biofuels and run solar thermal energy and hydraulic fracturing — a technique for extracting gas from unconventional geological formations underground — means droughts could hamper their deployment. “Water consumption is going up dramatically. We are introducing all kinds of technology to reduce the carbon impact of energy, without doing anything to reduce its impact on water,” Michele Wucker, co-author of the report, told a seminar at the New America Foundation, a think tank in Washington. The study, estimating the water consumption of conventional and renewable energy, found even so-called clean energy solutions use vast amounts of water. Hydroelectricity far outstrips other forms of energy in its use of water, requiring 4,500 gallons to produce a single megawatt hour of electricity — or about the amount needed to run a flat-screen TV for a year. Geothermal energy uses 1,400 gallons per megawatt-hour. Corn-based ethanol uses a lot of water to irrigate crops, as do nuclear plants which rely on water for cooling systems. Even some renewable energy sources — such as solar farms — are water hogs because they rely on water for cooling. Solar thermal farms use five times as much water as nuclear power plants, energy consultant Diana Glassman told the seminar. In contrast, photovoltaic solar cells, which convert energy from the sun into electricity, use minimal amounts of water. Meanwhile, the U.S. drought is forcing energy companies to scale back plans for deploying new techniques in hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) for oil and gas extraction. Not long ago, energy companies were hoping to increase production in Texas by 50 percent over the next five years. Unlike in Pennsylvania, where the chemicals used in natural gas drilling have contaminated drinking supplies, the problems in Texas are a matter of water quantity, not water quality. “The drought and declining water tables are going to have an increasing impact on oil and gas production in Texas,” Glassman said. It takes up to 13 million gallons of water to open up a single well in the Eagle Ford shale region in south Texas, where water is in perennially short supply. Such demands are going to block development of areas in south and west Texas, which are suffering water shortages. “As hydraulic fracking spreads into more arid environments, water availability will increasingly become a problem. Over time it’s going to be a growth constraint on oil production in parts of West Texas,” said Glassman. Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "title": "Warming, Overfishing, Plastic Pollution Destroying Ocean Life: Scientists",
    "date": "2011-06-29T19:00:43-04:00",
    "content": "The state of the oceans can best be likened to a case of multiple organ failure in urgent need of intervention, suggests the most comprehensive analysis yet of the world’s marine ecosystems. Global warming, overfishing and plastic pollution are wreaking havoc at an unprecedented rate on marine life, reported scientists at a recent meeting of the International Program on the State of the Ocean (IPSO). The impacts of climate change — acidifying oceans, coral bleaching and habitat loss — are the biggest cause of decline in ocean health, and the hardest to solve, some researchers told SolveClimate News in interviews. Global warming will “swamp everything,” said Tony Pitcher, a professor of fisheries from the University of British Columbia who attended the meeting. “The effects are all around … If we don’t do something quickly, the oceans in 50 years won’t look like they do today.” The workshop brought together 27 scientists from six countries and represents the first time in at least a decade when experts from separate fields — geochemists, geophysicists, pollution experts, fishery biologists and climate change scientists — gathered to share their assessment of the oceans. “These people don’t usually talk to each other very much so getting them together … was quite a special occasion,” said Pitcher. But the scene was far from celebratory. “In each kind of science, the experts were reporting that somewhere in the world the worst-case scenario was already present,” he told SolveClimate News. The Next Great Extinction Climate scientists continue to report that atmospheric levels of CO2 are rising at an accelerated rate, spelling trouble for the oceans. Seas absorb the heat-trapping gas, which makes them more acidic. Acidity of the world’s oceans has increased 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution, said Bärbel Hönisch, a professor of earth science at Columbia University who did not attend the workshop. Ocean acidification stresses corals, shellfish and other organisms with effects that ripple through the marine food chain. Adding to that ocean stress is overfishing, the IPSO assessment said. The large and long-lived species in fisheries worldwide — and in the South China Seas in particular — are “virtually fished out,” Pitcher explained. When added together, conditions may be ripe for the next great extinction similar to the five mass extinctions that have occurred throughout Earth history. “That was the comparison that was made,” said Pitcher. “Certainly the rate of change in the chemistry of the oceans is greater than in some of the ancient extinctions.” Hönisch was more cautious. We won’t wipe out ocean life, she predicted, but toxic algal blooms will thrive in the absence of large fish and other organisms threatened by extinction. “The question for me has always been, do we care about the fish that are commercially interesting?” Hönisch asked. “Do we care about what we have today?” The Climate Change Threat Climate change is the oceans’ greatest threat, said Daniel Pauly, a fisheries professor from the University of British Columbia who also attended the seminar. As oceans heat up, there is less mixing of warm water near the sea surface and colder water near the bottom, he told SolveClimate News. That decreases the amount of available oxygen in the water column; less oxygen means less life overall. Oxygen depletion, acidification and warmer temperatures are “a deadly mixture,” Pauly said, and is almost certain to exacerbate other risks. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, said Alex Rogers, lead author of the IPSO report and professor of conservation biology at the University of Oxford. Extreme Weather and Coral Bleaching The underwater reef formations, often called the rainforests of the sea, are built by tiny animals called coral polyps that create limestone formations by constantly taking calcium carbonate out of the sea. Coral reefs are the most diverse ecosystems in the ocean housing millions of species, Rogers told SolveClimate News. They provide ecosystem services such as food, coastal protection, tourism and recreation that are worth up to $375 billion dollars per year, he said. Corals live off the microscopic algae that dwell inside their tissues. Elevated water temperatures can cause coral bleaching, a whitening of corals that occurs when they expel algae. Corals eventually die, erode and collapse from continuous bleaching. Charles Sheppard, a professor in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Warwick and a workshop participant, said that an increase of 1 degree Celsius over about 10 weeks is enough to trigger bleaching. “It’s the extremes that do the killing,” he explained. Average temperatures in the oceans have increased about half a degree Celsius since the",

In a report by a government-appointed Climate Commission, the scientists said many of Australia’s major cities faced a serious threat from rising sea-levels, particularly Sydney. The Great Barrier Reef won’t be spared either, its coral a victim of rising ocean acidity from higher carbon dioxide levels from burning fossil fuels and felling forests. The report, titled “The Critical Decade,” aims to shift Australia’s current political debate over the government’s climate policy, which has polarized voters and been used by opposition parties to attack its parliamentary rivals. “This is the critical decade.

    "date": "2011-05-25T13:30:30-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Rep. Henry Waxman’s attempts to find out if a proposed controversial Canada-to-U.S. Gulf Coast oil sands pipeline will benefit Koch Industries appears to have hit a dead end. At least for the time being. Representatives for billionaire brothers and oil magnates Charles and David Koch — major donors to GOP elections and influential conservative organizations — are evidently stonewalling the California Democrat about their possible financial interest in seeing the permit approved for TransCanada’s proposed $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline. Two powerful House Republicans told Waxman they are not interested in pursuing any additional inquiries with Koch Industries. That refusal prompted Waxman to try another tactic during a Monday afternoon hearing on Capitol Hill. He offered to expand his investigation to include all energy companies that might benefit from Keystone XL so as not to single out Koch. “I have no objection to asking other companies about their interests in tar sands,” Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said during an Energy and Power Subcommittee hearing. “What I do object to is protecting Koch from legitimate scrutiny.” “This pipeline and the legislation that supports it will enable the oil companies to charge American consumers more for their gasoline, while increasing carbon pollution and endangering precious water supplies,” he continued. “We know who will lose. We also need to find out who will benefit.” Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, called Waxman’s queries a “blatant political sideshow.” Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield of Kentucky did not directly respond to Waxman’s request to broaden the inquiry beyond Wichita-based Koch. But the Republican did say it was unfair to focus on one company. In February, the Los Angeles Times tallied up what kind of influence Koch might have on the House Energy and Commerce Committee via campaign contributions. Republicans, who gained a resounding majority in the lower chamber after the November midterm elections, started calling the shots at the House committee when the 112th Congress convened in January. L.A. Times reporters found that Koch donations to panel members outpaced even that of mega-energy companies such as Exxon Mobil. Records show that Koch and its employees gave $279,500 to 22 of the energy committee’s 31 Republicans and $32,000 to five Democrats. Legislation Attracts Two Democrats “This is not about personalities,” Whitfield said about Keystone XL and legislation he is co-sponsoring to set a deadline for a “yes” or “no” answer on its construction. “This is about a project and its benefit or lack of benefit to the American people.” Whitfield is among 13 co-sponsors of a bill penned by GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska and officially introduced after Monday’s hearing. Upton is also a prominent co-sponsor. Terry’s measure has also attracted support from two Democrats, Reps. Mike Ross of Arkansas and Gene Green of Texas. The Cornhusker State is one of half a dozen states the 1,375-mile U.S. section of the underground pipeline would cross through on its entire 1,702-mile proposed path from the tar sands mines in TransCanada’s home province of Alberta to Gulf of Mexico oil refineries. The other states are Montana, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. In a nutshell, what is being called The North American-Made Energy Security Act of",

    "date": "2011-05-23T19:30:35-04:00",
    "content": "A new measure imposed by Pennsylvania regulators to stop natural gas drillers from disposing harmful wastewater at treatment plants has sent the industry scrambling for alternatives. Companies specializing in the latest filtration technologies are rushing to meet the need. Some firms are already positioned with proven solutions that can handle wastewater from fracking operations. Many others are working feverishly to apply their technologies to cash in on the boom in business. For Canadian firm Aqua-Pure Ventures Inc., phones have been ringing nonstop since April, when the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) gave Marcellus Shale gas drillers 30 days to voluntarily stop delivering salty and chemical-laced wastewater to water treatment facilities by May 19. “Darn near every [water treatment] plant out there has been calling us in the last three weeks since oil and gas companies stopped taking water to them,” Aqua-Pure chairman Richard Magnus told SolveClimate News from his office in Calgary, Alberta. “Our phones are ringing off the hook, with all those plants looking for a technology that works.” The company says its Nomad evaporator technology can turn between 75 and 95 percent of “produced water,” as the toxic drilling byproduct is known, into distilled fresh water. It can then be reused in drilling or discharged into local waterways. For over a year, Aqua-Pure has been selling its technology to the privately owned Eureka Resources of Williamsport, Pa. Eureka discharges its pre-treated gas well water to the Williamsport Sanitary Authority. Eureka’s facility is the only gas-well water facility in the state that meets the DEP’s new discharge regulations for the disposal of wastewater into Pennsylvania’s streams, the company confirmed. Environmental groups said they hope the new compliance order will help spur the development of more crucial wastewater solutions like Aqua-Pure’s. “Those new technologies that are coming online are absolutely critical,” said Jan Jarrett, president and CEO of Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future (PennFuture). “There need to be options for the drillers to use that are safe and that will guarantee Pennsylvanians that their water won’t be contaminated and that their drinking water supplies will be safe.” But the technologies are not yet widely deployed, and many drillers in Pennsylvania will be left in a pinch under the new order, she continued. “Some may have to slow down or shut down their operations until they identify where they could dispose of their wastewater.” Deborah Nardone, who heads the Sierra Club’s natural gas campaign in Pennsylvania, said the current inability of wastewater treatment facilities to properly treat produced water was part of the reason the organization has called for a moratorium on all new gas extraction. “We’ve advanced at lightening speed to get the gas out without thinking about whether we have the technology to effectively deal with it,” she said. “It is pretty evident that we don’t have the technology.” Water’s Fate a Major Concern Gas drilling is soaring in Pennsylvania, due to a relatively new technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that blasts water, chemicals and sand deep underground to open up fissures in shale rock and release gas. How and where the contaminated water is dumped has become an issue of great concern. In Pennsylvania, about 2,500 fracking wells have already been drilled statewide, and at least 60,000 new wells are expected through the year",

    "date": "2011-05-18T20:30:36-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—Ho hum. The average air temperature in the United States has leapt two degrees in the last five decades. Yawn. Coastal regions in the country are disappearing because of rising sea levels. Hit the snooze button. The already-arid Southwest is becoming drier. Snore. Whether it’s paralysis, fatigue or an indication of the arrival of “post-climate times,” a major National Research Council mid-May report warning about the severe dangers of accumulating greenhouse gas emissions seems to have barely registered as a blip on the Richter scale of environmental urgency. Perhaps that shouldn’t be so shocking. After all, Congress, the very entity that requested the report, is pretty much punting on the carbon issue. And the Obama administration is focusing on other energy solutions, having seemingly flushed once-optimal options such as cap and trade or a carbon tax. Several years ago, the Natural Research Council, a branch of the renowned National Academy of Sciences, was tasked with laying out steps and strategies that policymakers could adopt to mitigate the effects of climate change. The just-released “America’s Climate Choices” is the fifth and final volume examining all aspects of tackling global warming. While the amalgam of 22 academics, climate scientists, think tank leaders, businesspeople and politicians involved in creating the latest report herald the idea of a price on carbon and present a series of broad recommendations for U.S. decision-makers, they do not outline any specific policy recipes. The authors defend their non-prescriptive approach. In-the-know observers, however, view it as a signature drawback because it highlights the classic divide between scientific reality and political courage. Nothing comes to fruition because scientists are traditionally skittish about offering policy prescriptions and legislators are equally twitchy about acting on groundbreaking science that is often too complicated for them to fully grasp. “It’s a fabulous report with top-caliber participants,” Paul Bledsoe, a senior adviser with the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center, told SolveClimate News in an interview. “But simply issuing reports is not adequate anymore. My frustration is that the traditional method of communicating science is not gaining traction politically. It has to be done in innovative ways that engage stakeholders and legislators.” Objectivity Versus Advocacy The foreword to “America’s Climate Choices” clearly spells out that the authors deliberately avoided being policy prescriptive because some scientists believe “recommending a particular option would carry them beyond objectivity and into advocacy.” Peggy Shepard, one of several non-scientists who served on the committee that issued the latest report, told SolveClimate News that was a logical decision. “With scientists, their job isn’t to think about the politics or policy,” said Shepard, the executive director of New York City’s WE ACT for Environmental Justice. “We wanted to lay out options and scenarios and then describe the implications for making any of those choices.” For instance, she said, the committee didn’t want to “turn off half the country” by suggesting that cap and trade or a carbon tax or no regulation at all was the one and only solution. “We definitely thought about the political environment,” Shepard said. “But remember, when we started on this the Obama administration was just getting started.” Economy Trouncing Climate Shepard is convinced the report’s message about acting on climate now would have resonated loudly and been the focus of non-stop chatter on Capitol Hill and in board rooms if the timing had been different. “We’d like a bigger splash, we’d like everybody to be talking about it,” she said. “But that just isn’t the reality in this economic and legislative environment when all the talk is about jobs and the economy.” She pointed out that the committee began deliberations more than two years ago when climate change was a hot-button issue everywhere. For example, Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts were on the verge of celebrating an American Clean Energy and Security Act cap-and-trade victory in the House. “When climate change legislation was fairly active, we thought we could play a role,” Shepard said. “In many respects, some of the people on our panel did think what we were doing was bold. I don’t know if you can say the report is not aggressive enough. Given the economic crisis and the stalemate in Congress, people have become inured to this discussion.” Shepard praised the report’s authors for broaching such issues as adaptation and the need for the federal government to become a major energy research and development force. “This report has been very straightforward in pointing out that climate change is an urgent issue and that signs of it are occurring right now,” she said. “Our goal is to advise the government that it must immediately begin coordinating activities that will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases.” The report reflects a deep dive on the part of scientists and other stakeholders who understand this country’s limits and challenges on the global warming front, she said. “I don’t know if the scientists would blanch at the word roadmap, but this is certainly much more of a blueprint or a roadmap,” she continued. “And I don’t think that comprehensive view has been published before. It’s much deeper than a United Nations report and is tailored to America.” Common-Sense Recommendations The 118-page report emphasizes that as a signer of the Copenhagen Accord in",

New research shows that the American pika, the mountain-dwelling relative of the rabbit roughly half as big as a football, began rapidly fleeing lower elevations and dying off in the Great Basin region of the U.S. West a decade ago. The change coincides with the time frame when human-generated greenhouse gas emissions began to leave a massive imprint on climate and sea levels, scientists say, and the implications are considerable for a multitude of species. “The rules of the extinction game have changed,” said Erik Beever, a research ecologist at the U.S. Geologic Survey’s Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center in Montana and lead author of the peer-reviewed paper, which will soon be published in the print edition of the journal Global Change Biology. “Typically, species have been endangered by habitat loss, exploitation and hunting, and to a lesser degree invasive species,” Beever told SolveClimate News. “In the case of the pikas, none of these are the issue.” Beever and his colleagues recorded more extreme temperatures and less precipitation at sites where the rabbit-like critters are going extinct than at those where they are thriving. Higher highs and lower lows consistent with global warming models could have made the pint-sized pikas more susceptible to disease, heat stress or predation, Beever said.

By selling 5,000 tiles at $100 each to locals, the city is aiming to piece together entire rooftop solar arrays at seven budget-strapped schools, youth centers and houses of worship. A team of Oaklanders will be trained and hired to install the panels by as early as July. The city’s efforts are part of a pilot program called Solar Mosaic, a web-based marketplace for community solar initiatives that launched on April 15. Using the “crowdfunding” model, residents can help generate energy savings and scale back greenhouse gas emissions without having to shell out tens of thousands of dollars for a solar installation at home. They’ll also help create jobs for a budding green-collar workforce in a city with the state’s highest crime rates and where 17.5 percent of people live below the poverty line, compared to 13 percent nationally. “There is this huge gap between the population that wants to go solar and the people that actually have,” Billy Parish, president of Solar Mosaic, told SolveClimate News. “We saw an opportunity to connect those dots.” Parish said he and fellow co-founder Daniel Rosen first conceived of the mosaic concept while working to develop renewable energy projects with Native American tribes in the U.S. Southwest and Great Plains regions. “We realized that the obstacles that the tribes faced were the same obstacles that schools, places of worship, community centers and other nonprofits around the country faced” — namely, a lack of cash needed to go solar or pay off high interest rates on loans. “For the last ten months, we’ve been on a journey to figure out the best way to enable and catalyze community solar and have found a model that works,” he said.

    "date": "2011-04-22T14:00:06-04:00",
    "content": "SARKOY, TURKEY—The fight to stop the global oil industry exploring the pristine deep waters of the Arctic has been dubbed the new cold war, and early on Friday it escalated as environmental activists from 12 countries occupied the world’s second largest rig on its way from Turkey to Greenland to drill among the icebergs. The protesters found the 52,000-ton semi-submersible at around midnight, steaming due west at a stately six knots in the sea of Marmaris, heading for the Dardanelle straits and the open Mediterranean. It took four more hours for Greenpeace to bring in its inflatables and a further 50 minutes in the choppy moonlit sea to intercept it. Even from three miles away, the Chinese-built mobile rig, which specializes in drilling in extreme environments, looks huge. From 100 feet away in the pale dawn light it is a 15-storey industrial castle, bristling with cranes, derricks, gangways, chains, spars, girders, pipes, helipads and radar. Just 10 years old, it is already rusting and its paintwork is streaked from years of drilling in harsh west African, north Atlantic and Asian waters. The Greenpeace boats approached the vessel cautiously in the three-foot swell, like fleas to the backside of an elephant. At exactly 5.31 AM, the 11 climbers began to leap on to its hull and headed for a ladder. The plan was to stop the vessel in its tracks not by taking over the bridge, but by radioing the captain and asking politely. Fat chance. “This is Greenpeace, this is Greenpeace. I’m informing you that we have put climbers on your rig. I ask you stop your vessel,” asked Korol Diker, a Turkish campaigner, on a VHF channel. But the elephant barely registered. “I do not recognize you,” came the captain’s cutting reply and the Leiv Eiriksson steamed on. Undaunted, the climbers made it to a gangway 80 feet over the vessel’s starboard stern. As four crewmen peered over the side from 30 feet above them, and two more ambled over, seemingly unconcerned, the climbers made a cat’s cradle of rope to hang banners and a tent from. You can understand why the captain did not want to stop. The Scottish oil company Cairn Energy has hired the Leiv Eiriksson for around $500,000 a day and the company, run by Sir Bill Gammell, the former international rugby player, plans to spend more than $500 million (£300 million) in the next few months looking for oil in some of the most dangerous and coldest waters in the world. Any major delay could cost it millions and set back its plans for the Arctic by a year, because drilling is only possible in the July-October “summer window” when the ice has retreated. Cairn, which will be the only company to drill deep wells offshore in the Arctic this year, holds 11 licenses in Baffin Bay covering over 80,000 square kilometers. It plans to drill four exploratory wells to depths of around 5,000 feet, the deepest ever attempted in the Arctic. It is taking the Leiv Eiriksson and the Ocean Rig Corcovado — a drill ship now stationed near Aberdeen — as well as a fleet of backup vessels. Last year the company claimed it had struck oil in Baffin Bay after drilling several 300-foot wells. But it later admitted that it had found no significant quantities. The venture, say environmentalists, is just the start of what is planned to be a risky offshore oil rush. Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and others have licenses to explore in Baffin Bay, mostly above the Arctic circle. Others, including BP and Rosneft, plan to extract oil offshore from Siberia, Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic. The U.S. government estimates there are 90 billion barrels of oil, around 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered reserves. But for Greenpeace and others the risk of a devastating spill is too great, raising the specter of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in",

    "date": "2011-05-01T07:30:03-04:00",
    "content": "The sign at the end of Jill Wiener’s driveway simply reads “No Frack.” The declaration reflects her two-year effort to keep natural gas wells off her and her neighbors’ property. Wiener lives in Sullivan County, New York, 9 miles east of the scenic Delaware River near the Pennsylvania border. Tourism and agriculture drive the region’s economy. “It’s very mellow and beautiful,” she says, the kind of place “where people sit outside to watch the fireflies at night.” Now the bucolic landscape may be under threat, Wiener muses, due to the “domino effect” of a new drilling method spreading eastward across the United States. Sullivan County overlies the Marcellus Shale formation that stretches 150,000 square miles from New York across most of Pennsylvania, through parts of Maryland, Ohio and West Virginia. The formation contains enough natural gas to heat the nation for two decades or more. Improved recovery technology known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has made the resource economical to extract in recent years, fueling a drilling frenzy as well as highly publicized environmental concerns. Recent reports reveal that wastewater from the practice contains radioactive material and is being dumped in public waters. Gas companies say fracking is safe. The heart of the action is in Pennsylvania for now. Wiener’s state of New York has a fracking moratorium until July 3, though many upstate residents have already signed leases with gas companies. Wiener says she isn’t taking any chances. For two years she has worked to educate her community about potential air and water pollution through a group called Catskill Citizens for Safe Energy. The volunteer organization confronts gas industry representatives at town meetings and set up screenings of the anti-fracking documentary “Gasland.” “We really feel the key to success in defeating fracking as an option for gas extraction is education,” she says. “[I’m] all about pushing information forward, and being cautious.” The most powerful learning tool for advocates in areas unaccustomed to gas exploration may be the Web. Thanks to a series of social networking tools called ExtrAct developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Wiener has connected online with citizens who have lived for decades among the gas fields. A small but growing group of users shares personal stories of drilling impacts such as contaminated water wells and health problems. “It sure is nice to be able to see what people in other places have experienced,” says Wiener. Empowering Landowners ExtrAct was founded three years ago at MIT’s Center for Future Civic Media in the midst of the Marcellus boom to empower anxious landowners in their dealings with industry leasing agents, or “landmen,” who offer tough-to-resist deals. In Pennsylvania, natural gas companies have already leased about 7 million acres of public and private property — about one-quarter of the state’s entire land mass — according to state authorities. Landowners can rake in millions with the initial lease and ensuing royalties. “We have a lot of information [about drilling] from the industry, and from the states,” explains Chris Csikszentmihályi, director of the Center for Future Civic Media, “but very little info from actual people who encounter the industry as regular citizens.” This is one of those “key moments when information will make a big difference,” Csikszentmihályi adds.

    "date": "2011-04-14T08:30:48-04:00",
    "content": "The coal industry is banking on America’s first commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project, set to be built in West Virginia, to jump-start commercialization of the technology and make it more affordable. But the project is far from being a sure thing. The failure last year to legislate a carbon cap on U.S. power plants and direct proceeds from a price on emissions to projects like this one has left a gaping hole in needed financing. The utility planning the $670 million CCS addition to its 1,300-megawatt Mountaineer coal plant in New Haven, W.Va., has yet to find the funds from another source — despite hefty support from a federal program. American Electric Power (AEP) says that regulators in Virginia and West Virginia are reluctant to charge ratepayers for costs related to the project because of continued policy uncertainty in Congress. “So far, [regulators] have not been willing to support cost recovery for CCS ahead of a federal mandate to cut carbon emissions from power plants,” Melissa McHenry, an AEP spokesperson, told SolveClimate News via email. Deploying this first plant will take more money, she said, and this will have to come from Washington or the states. “The biggest challenge for moving forward with CCS will be the ability to get financial support for advancing the technology — either from the federal government or from state utility commissions.” Most analysts agree that to promote a surge of investment in CCS from public and private sectors, a federal law to limit emissions is needed that would set a price on carbon emissions. A report released last year by President Obama’s Interagency Task Force on CCS made this point clear: “A carbon price is critical” for “widespread cost-effective deployment of CCS.” AEP: CCS Needed to Tackle Climate Change America’s fleet of roughly 1,500 coal plants produces nearly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year and accounts for about 30 percent of total U.S. emissions. AEP is the biggest U.S. electricity generator and the largest consumer of coal in the nation, burning some 77 million short tons of the fossil fuel per year. Appalachian Power (APCo), an AEP subsidiary based in Charleston, W.Va., distributes power from the 30-year-old Mountaineer plant. The parent utility’s 235-megawatt CCS project would deploy experimental technology from France’s Alstom SA that would use a chilled ammonia solution to absorb about 90 percent of the carbon dioxide the facility releases. The solution would be pressurized and heated, then compressed and piped 1.5 miles into deep saline aquifers below the site. Last October, AEP’s 20-megawatt demonstration became the first in the country to inject a portion of a coal plant’s carbon emissions underground. Columbus-based Battelle, the world’s largest independent research institute, first evaluated the geology of the Mountaineer site in",

    "date": "2011-04-07T14:45:21-04:00",
    "content": "It is well known that deforestation is shrinking the carbon storage capacity of tropical forests, one of the world’s great land-based carbon sinks. Now a pair of studies confirms that two key marine CO2 stores — mangroves and kelp forests — are also in peril from human activity. The findings, scientists say, highlight the need to protect carbon- and biodiversity-rich ocean forests from development and global warming by including them in existing forest-conservation programs. Mangrove forests — trees and shrubs that thrive in brackish waters — have declined 30 to 50 percent in the past 50 years, according to one study out this week in the journal Nature Geoscience. The seaside carbon sinks are generally being razed for coastal development such as houses, roads, railways, as well as to turn wetlands into farmland and expand fishing. Towns built on coasts nearby can also leach toxins into the forests and poison sediment, harming life-giving root systems. Mangroves suck up carbon through the atmosphere during photosynthesis and store it in their leaves, branches and above-ground roots. Because their thick, mucky soils have fairly low oxygen levels, the natural decay of the biomass is slow, resulting in a steady but heavy buildup of carbon over time. For the first time, scientists have crunched the numbers on the carbon sequestered in these trees, dead organic matter and soil in 25 sites across Micronesia, Indonesia and Bangladesh — which house a large portion of Earth’s mangroves — and gleaned insight into salty forests worldwide. The international team, led by Daniel Donato, an ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station in Hilo, Hawaii, said soils account for a massive 45 to 98 percent of carbon storage in mangrove ecosystems. Because of this, “coastal mangrove forests store more carbon than almost any other forest on Earth,” the research station said via release. Earlier research by Steven Bouillon, a mangrove ecologist with Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, estimated that the world’s mangroves take in more than 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, with some of it being stored and the rest getting cycled through to nourish other ecosystems. Uproot the trees and degrade the soil, and the carbon gets spewed back into the atmosphere, the new study affirms. In total, mangrove destruction releases as many as 120 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, it finds — an amount nearly equivalent to the yearly emissions of Norway, Finland and Sweden combined. The emissions footprint of clearing mangroves is disproportionate to their presence. While mangroves encompass only 0.7 percent of the world’s tropical rainforests, their discharge of stored carbon accounts for roughly 10 percent of all deforestation-related emissions, Donato said in an interview. In total, forest loss is responsible for nearly a fifth of the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change. Kelp Forests At Risk from Climate-Related Storms Kelp plants, known as the “underwater forest,” are another vital ecosystem at risk, though for different reasons, according to a report published online on Mar. 24 in the journal Global Change Biology. The large beds of seaweed, which can grow up to 50 feet high, are scattered across the globe in temperate and polar regions, including the entire west coast of North America. They are widely considered one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth because of a high rate of carbon cycling, the process by which carbon travels through the ecological community. In giant kelp plants, most cycling of carbon works this way: the seaweed takes in carbon through photosynthesis; marine life such as sea urchins graze on the kelp to provide them life, inhaling the carbon. It then moves through the food web relatively quickly as one organism consumes another. While large swathes of carbon get recycled through the ecosystem, the kelp forests are believed to store as many as 60 million metric tons of carbon, according to a",

    "date": "2011-03-30T20:25:56-04:00",
    "content": "WASHINGTON—With all of the janitorial duties the EPA is being asked to perform on tasks left undone by the previous administration, perhaps mops should be standard issue at the agency. Coal ash regulations are one of the latest additions to that catch-up list. The agency’s own internal watchdog has given Environmental Protection Agency authorities 90 days to respond to research showing the agency promoted the use of coal ash products — on farm fields, as structural fill for roadway embankments or bound into products such as wallboard, concrete, roofing materials and bricks — with incomplete information about potential risks to people’s health and the environment. The not-so-gentle reminder stems from a policy put in place during George W. Bush’s presidency.  Arthur Elkins Jr. sent his March 23 report to Mathy Stanislaus, assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response. Elkins issued his findings as EPA authorities are reviewing thousands of comments in preparation for writing the final draft of first-ever national coal ash regulations. A rule laying out two potential paths was published in the Federal Register in June. Environmental advocacy organizations such as the Knoxville, Tenn.-based Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Earthjustice cheered the timing of the report, partially because it’s focusing on an issue that they have urged the Obama administration to consider a priority. “The ’s report shows us how important it is to get this issue under control,” Josh Galperin, the alliance’s policy analyst and research attorney told SolveClimate News in an interview. “It’s important for the EPA to distinguish what is an actual beneficial reuse and what the industry is calling a beneficial reuse. “This report sheds light on how the Bush administration was overlooking the science in order to make things easier for the coal industry,” he continued, adding that clearly an assessment of coal ash is necessary. “My suspicion is that the  realized what was going on here and thought this needed to be brought to light.” Legacy of Bush Administration In response to an e-mail inquiry from SolveClimate News, an EPA spokeswoman said the agency plans to comply with the ’s two major recommendations. One calls for defining and putting into place risk evaluation practices for beneficial uses of coal combustion residuals, and the other suggests determining if further action is warranted to address historical coal ash structural fill applications.

    "title": "Q&A: Can Canada’s Pristine Boreal Forest Be Saved By Conservation?",
    "date": "2011-03-29T07:34:42-04:00",
    "content": "The Pew Environment Group released a report earlier this month urging protection of the Canadian boreal, the world’s largest intact forest and the biggest carbon sink on land. (Listen to the SolveClimate News podcast episode: Canada’s Pristine Forest of Blue: Conservation or Death by 1,000 Cuts) The study says the “forest of blue,” which covers 60 percent of Canada’s landmass and contains nearly 200 million acres of surface freshwater, is under threat from oil sands development, mining, logging and hydropower projects, despite efforts to protect large swathes of it. David Sassoon spoke with Steven Kallick, director of the International Boreal Conservation Campaign at Pew, who has devoted much of his life to the boreal’s conservation. David Sassoon: What are some of the report’s key findings? Steven Kallick: The most important finding is that this area is the largest intact wetlands complex in the world. It has the most unfrozen surface freshwater of any ecosystem on the planet, and some of the world’s largest lakes. There’s no other landscape like it. And the value of this resource goes way beyond the borders of Canada. It has global effects on climate, on carbon sequestration and on migratory wildlife that really make it a global concern. Sassoon: What inspired the need for the report? Kallick: We saw this paper on global surface freshwater, and it was quite apparent that Canada’s boreal forest stood out as the one place where you have both a biological treasure and a political opportunity. It really differentiated itself from Brazil and Russia, in that we felt we could work in Canada successfully. The argument is, if we don’t do conservation planning in advance of this development, then this forest will end up in a few decades as degraded as every other temperate or tropical forest in the world. And that’s what we don’t want to see. Sassoon: What does all that water mean for people around the world? Kallick: One of the things that science is just starting to figure out is that the existence of that much water in the summer causes quite a bit of evaporation and probably has a pretty significant impact on rainfall patterns in our mountains in North America. We have also seen — because of all the work that’s been done on Arctic sea ice — that water flowing out of Canada’s boreal forest is a major necessary component in the mechanism of creating sea ice in the high Arctic. And that’s important for cooling the entire planet. Of course, we know that the boreal forest is a major carbon sink. The amount of carbon stored in the boreal forest just in Canada is thought to be 26 to 27 times the annual industrial output of carbon on the planet. It’s a tremendous volume of carbon that’s safely stored away in the wetlands and the peat bogs of the forest. Sassoon: In what ways are these resources, and the ecosystem services they provide, under threat? Kallick: There are some that are quite dramatic. And you can see them from outer space, such as the development of the tar sands in Alberta, where they have to remove the boreal from the surface before they can strip mine the bitumen that they use to make synthetic oil. But we also see impacts scattered across the forest from mining, and other oil and gas development, hydropower development and of course logging. Though, logging, interestingly enough, is one bright spot because last year we helped broker an agreement between environmental groups and timber companies to reduce the amount of logging. What you’re really looking at here is cumulative development. In a sense, death by a thousand cuts. Sassoon: You mentioned the boreal forest in Russia. What happened to it? Kallick: Development started in earnest after World War II. There was a national defense component to it, and an industrial development strategy implemented by the Soviets where they placed multiple pulp mills in remote regions of the boreal to build up the population and infrastructure. Probably 40 or 50 percent of that forest has been developed by roads or logging. It’s a cautionary tale for us, because we can see there have been significant impacts on water quality, on wetlands, wildlands and wild forests. Sassoon: You have some policy recommendations at the end of the report. What are they? Kallick: We’re saying — based on what biologists are telling us — that if you protect at least 50 percent of the entire forest from development of any kind, then you will assure that the ecological functions will continue in a robust way, in a healthy way. But in addition to that, we need to reform mining legislation, modernize it in Canada, and make sure that water quality is protected as part of that. There are a lot of governments right now making good moves and doing the right thing with regard to the boreal forest. Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Labrador, the federal government — they’re leading the way on conservation. There are laggards. And I mentioned Alberta because of problems in water quality, but they’re also not doing a good job with conservation land-use planning in the far North. British Columbia is struggling with conservation planning and mining. There are a tremendous number of mines proposed in the boreal forest in British Columbia. And we believe there’s inadequate planning and regulation going on there. The Yukon Territory has one large protected area proposal they’re considering, but it’s been a struggle. The government has not been friendly to the concept of large-scale conservation. And the Saskatchewan government in particular seems to have no interest. Sassoon: Do U.S. policymakers have a role in some of this conservation effort? Kallick: Americans have a pretty critical role. We’re the number one consumer globally for resources from this forest. It’s now our number one source of imported oil. I’m sure it’s our number one source of imported electricity, our number one source of timber. The trade relationship between the US and Canada is the world’s largest. So we have a big impact just in the choices we make in the commerce between our countries. Sassoon: Any final comments about this amazing forest? Kallick: For anybody who loves canoeing, loves wetlands, loves bird-watching, loves fishing, this is one of the great resources in the world. If this treasure is going to be preserved, it really has to be protected through careful and thoughtful planning in advance.

    "date": "2011-03-23T15:52:46-04:00",
    "content": "Rising global temperatures could trigger more extreme drought conditions in the coming decades in East Africa, U.S. researchers have concluded. Their findings contradict earlier research from a United Nations science panel and could have far-reaching consequences for American food aid. The researchers, who reported their conclusions in the journal Climate Dynamics, used data spanning six decades to show that rising sea surface temperatures from emissions of human origin have created an intensification of air circulation in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, also known as the “Walker cell.” This strengthening has caused the circulation to swell westward toward the African coast, boosting heat transfer in the atmosphere and triggering greater rainfall and cloud cover over the Indian Ocean over the past 30 years. For East Africa, this has spelled trouble — perhaps counterintuitively. The study finds that warm and dry winds have moved west toward Africa’s coast, inhibiting rainfall, particularly in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia from March to June, one of the main growing seasons. Chris Funk, a climatologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who led the study, said in an interview that this drought pattern can be expected regularly in the future — and during both rainy seasons, they now believe. He and co-author Park Williams, a postdoctoral researcher at U.C. Santa Barbara, have submitted follow-up results for potential publication. ‘Food Insecurity More Fragile,’ Report Shows Their research will influence food aid and development funding to the estimated 17.5 million food insecure people living in the region’s three most afflicted countries — Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia — according to officials from the USAID Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which funded the study. “We take very seriously the picture this new research is painting for the Horn of Africa,” Gary Eilerts, program manager of the FEWS NET, told SolveClimate News. “The situation it describes will certainly make food insecurity more fragile in the already extremely vulnerable region.” Prior research by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) showed that there will be more rain over East Africa, not less. But at least over the past two decades — and particularly since the year",

    "date": "2011-03-18T15:00:59-04:00",
    "content": "Climate change skeptics who have created a political megaphone in Washington may finally meet their match in the world’s largest search engine. Google.org, the technology giant’s philanthropic arm, has hand-picked a team of 21 fellows working in climate research to improve the way the science of global warming is communicated to the public and lawmakers through new media. “We are seeing very clearly with climate change that our policy choices are currently not grounded in knowledge and understanding,” said Paul Higgins, a Google fellow and an associate policy director for the American Meteorological Society. The Google Science Communication Fellows program named its first round of participants on Tuesday. The announcement could not have come at a more timely juncture. On Monday, an annual Gallup poll on the environment reported that nearly 20 percent of Americans surveyed believe the effects of global warming will never happen, up from 11 percent three years ago, while fewer respondents are concerned about climate change than in the past. A day later, House Republicans in the Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously against three amendments offered by Democrats that would accept that climate change is occurring; that it is largely due to human activity; and that human-made warming poses a threat to public health and welfare. Democrats on the panel, all of whom voted for the measures, tied the proposals to larger GOP-backed legislation seeking to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. That global warming is doubted by large swathes of the country — despite a consensus among climate scientists worldwide that says otherwise — underscores the large gap between the data and America’s understanding of it, scientists say. ‘They’re Just Trying to Make Noise’ “The uncertainty argument, that we really don’t know what is going on and that climate scientists are corrupt, has been reasonably effective in the last few years,” said Andrew Dessler, also a Google fellow and a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. “We don’t know everything about the climate from a scientific standpoint and there are uncertainties, but they are uncertainties over whether climate change is going to either be bad or really, really bad,” he told SolveClimate News. “People who are opposed to regulation … [are] not trying to prove that climate change [science] is wrong. They’re trying to prove that there is an argument going on,” he said. “They’re just trying to create noise.” Higgins of AMS said that depending on their political beliefs, lawmakers have used skepticism or affirmation of climate science to stall or advance progress on partisan policy issues — such as the EPA’s “tailoring” rules or cap-and-trade schemes for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. For him, passing or rejecting the House amendments is less important than whether lawmakers actually understand climate science and are thoughtfully considering the risks of inaction. “If we were well informed as a society — and if policymakers were well informed — then they would be taking the risk that climate change should be taken seriously.” Higgins pointed out that the Google fellowship is geared just as much toward influencing those who believe that climate change poses serious consequences, but may not yet grasp the science. “The vast majority of people don’t know and understand the details of climate science,” he said. “The science of climate change spans 20 to 30 disciplines and sub-disciplines, at least … It is an enormous amount of information, and distilling it is a bit of a challenge.” Kelly Levin, a senior research associate at the World Resources Institute, a conservation group, said she hoped the Google program could tackle that challenge by engaging wider audiences in the scientific discussion. “Given the pace and scale of human-induced climate change, it is of great importance that climate change science, and the urgency of addressing the climate change problem, is communicated effectively to the public and decision makers,” she said. She added: “Involving the public more directly in the scientific process could increase the acceptance of ideas and help scientific advancements inform governmental policies.” A More Accessible Approach Throughout the year, the Google fellows will sharpen their new media skills, learn data-sharing technologies and improve communication strategies to lend a more accessible approach to climate science. Following a workshop in June, fellows will have the chance to apply for grants to support projects fostering scientific dialogue. Future participants will take on other socially relevant topics tied to science and the environment. “The public’s understanding of science across all disciplines is extremely low, because the scientific community is really siloed from the community in general,” Amy Luers, Google’s senior environment program manager, told SolveClimate News. “If the scientists understand [data] in a different way than the public does, it is impossible to see how this information is going to be integrated in the way it needs to be to make policy and management decisions,” she said.

Up to 40 percent of the leak was gas, mostly methane invisible to the naked eye, reported scientists who published their findings last month in the research journal Nature Geoscience. The study authors — Samantha Joye, Ian MacDonald, Ira Leifer and Vernon Asper — calculate the total volume of discharged gas as between 260,000 to 520,000 tons. That is enough, if burned, to supply the same amount of energy as 1.6 to 3.1 million barrels of crude oil. Gas and oil occur together in deep ocean deposits, so it should come as no surprise that the Macondo well released large amounts of gas. “Natural gas was a huge fraction of the hydrocarbon discharge … and we don’t know what happened to it,” said lead author Joye, a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia. The impact of the gas on marine ecosystems is largely unknown, and it has reignited a scientific debate about the behavior and whereabouts of hundreds of thousands of tons of natural gas.

    "content": "Editor’s Note: In this three-part series, SolveClimate News examines how landowners along the six-state route for TransCanada’s controversial Keystone XL pipeline are dealing with potential property condemnation. Part II: Defining Good Faith WASHINGTON—While TransCanada has maintained all along that its negotiations are fair and accomplished in good faith, landowner holdouts along the proposed six-state route for Keystone XL beg to differ. For instance, residents of Oklahoma and Texas — where oil is the economy’s bread and butter — are accustomed to navigating easement negotiations with domestic petroleum providers. But TransCanada’s approach evidently fired up these veterans. For instance, two advocacy organizations in Texas — Public Citizen Texas and Stop Tar Sands Oil Pipelines (STOP) — fielded dozens of complaints about how TransCanada land agents trespassed, didn’t offer specifics about Keystone XL carrying unconventional oil and were fuzzy about explaining pipeline safety precautions. “The reality is that people are being pushed around,” said Ryan Rittenhouse, a community organizer with Public Citizen Texas. “They are feeling intimidated and threatened by TransCanada, which is using the threat of eminent domain to coerce landowners into signing a contract they don’t want to sign.” In response to those concerns, TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha told SolveClimate News that he intends on following up with company land agents to research the details of the complaints. He added that the agents keep records of all of their meetings with property owners. Harlan Hentges, the attorney representing two generations of an Oklahoma family in a condemnation legal challenge, concluded TransCanada behaved inappropriately by approaching landowners one at a time. Rural residents, he emphasized, tend to be older, less savvy about their legal rights and not financially stable enough to afford legal counsel. “TransCanada’s argument is, ‘We acted in good faith.’ My argument is that you didn’t explain who you were and what you were doing,” Hentges claimed. “They acted as if this was nothing different from what went on before with Oklahoma-based pipelines. I don’t think anything about that could be considered good faith.” Montana More Progressive? No doubt, the Keystone XL pipeline’s path slices through ecologically valuable but deeply conservative territory in the nation’s heartland. So, while “takings” rhetoric espoused by politicians might sound as if states are intent on looking out for the rights of the pioneering and rugged individual, the harsh truth is that these supposed “protections” offered at the state level often tilt toward corporate gains. However, one exception among the six states might be Montana. The Big Sky State has at least passed more progressive legislation ensuring that environmental review of Keystone XL is more transparent. Those with hands-on experience with TransCanada negotiations in Montana attribute that to what’s called the “Major Facility Siting Act.” While it might not prevent a taking, it provides more opportunities for landowner and citizen input before condemnation becomes an issue. For instance, the advocacy organization Northern Plains Resource Council has formed a group for about 45 households along the Keystone XL route in western Montana. Rose Moore and other council organizers have compiled a four-page document that lists conditions for pipeline negotiations. They have asked the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to include these conditions as part of the permitting process. Conditions touch on topics such as TransCanada’s responsibilities and liabilities with regard to eminent domain; pipeline design, safety and construction; mitigation and spill cleanup. For example, it requires TransCanada to obtain all of its state and federal permits before resorting to eminent domain in Montana. As well, the company is required to train local volunteer fire departments in emergency response for all pipeline problems. “It’s kind of early in the process for us,” Moore said. “We’re hopeful that the DEQ takes into account what we asked them to take into account.” In addition, the council has asked Montana DEQ and the State Department to complete a supplemental environmental impact statement evaluating the impact of TransCanada’s decision to allow conventional domestic oil from the state to feed into Keystone XL. Oil from what’s called the Bakken Formation, which stretches across Montana, North Dakota and into parts of Saskatchewan, is not oil sands heavy crude. Legislative Roadblocks at State Level South Dakota, however, is having a devil of a time advancing legislation that would force a private company to acquire all of its permits before proceeding to the condemnation stage with landowners. Back in August, organizations began crafting a bill modeled after similar legislation in Wyoming and North Dakota. Then, GOP state Rep. Mike Verchio shocked supporters in early February by dropping his commitment to be the measure’s lead sponsor in the South Dakota Legislature. That likely postpones any further legislative action until this summer. Supporters had already lined up a lead sponsor on the Senate side. “Our primary sponsor inexplicably caved,” Stephanie Trask, an organizer with South Dakota-based Dakota Rural Action, said in an interview. “It was our first year of trying to bring up the bill, so we didn’t want to make an enemy. But it was a blow.” State legislators also have yet to act on a related bill covering pipeline bonding. This is the fourth year in a row the House has considered a measure that would place a per-barrel fee on oil shipped through the state to create a $30 million mitigation fund to cover damages and reclamation after a pipeline rupture. Dakota Rural Action organized three specific groups for landowners in three states along the Keystone XL route with the intent of helping them negotiate joint deals with TransCanada that offered the fairest price and soundest liability for property, water and livestock. Those groups are Protect South Dakota Resources, Eastern Montana Landowners and Landowners for Fairness in Nebraska. “The compensation might not be anything they are too happy about signing,” Trask said about an agreement reached with close to 100 South Dakota landowners in December. “But we got a bunch of things negotiated.” Even if the bill Verchio spurned at the last minute had passed with flying colors, she noted, it wouldn’t offer relief retroactively to South Dakota landowners on the Keystone XL route. “They are out of luck,” Trask said about the landowners. “TransCanada calls itself a common carrier. And South Dakota’s state statute says that’s good enough for a company to proceed to eminent domain proceedings if no contract is signed.” Tomorrow: Part III, Why Is TransCanada a ‘Common Carrier?’ Part I, Holding Out in Oklahoma Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

Part I: Holding Out in Oklahoma WASHINGTON—As the youngest of eight siblings, Doris Lynn knows firsthand how diligently her family members labored on their 180-acre crop and livestock farm to fill their stomachs and their bank account. So it’s little wonder the 61-year-old is now reluctant to give up even a square inch of her inheritance in far southeastern Oklahoma’s Bryan County, near the Texas border. That pride in ownership — and a pursuit of fairness — have prompted two generations of her family to hire an attorney to counter a Canadian oil pipeline company’s attempt to deploy eminent domain to condemn about an acre at one corner of the family farm where three natural gas pipelines are already buried. It’s within a half-mile from the house Lynn shares with her husband, Cecil, and that proximity makes both of them nervous when it comes to the possibility of a leak or other emergency. Calgary-based TransCanada is seeking right-of-way from thousands of landowners in six states along a 1,375-mile U.S. route stretching from the Montana/Saskatchewan border all the way through Texas. The proposed 36-inch-diameter pipeline, the controversial Keystone XL, is part of an infrastructure designed to pump up to 900,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil from the tar sands mines in the province of Alberta to refineries along the Gulf Coast. “They came out here with an offer and we said no,” Lynn told SolveClimate News in an interview about TransCanada’s quest for the legal right to cross part of her property, known as an easement. “This land was left to us kids. When somebody comes in and tells us they’re going to take our land, well they’re barking up the wrong tree.” Oklahoma attorney Harlan Hentges filed the legal challenge on behalf of Lynn and the other children and grandchildren of the late A.L. and Dollie White at the state district court in Durant. “The prospect of a foreign company using the U.S. law to take land from U.S. citizens, this is problematic,” he said in an interview. “I think we have a strong case but the deck is stacked against the individual and in favor of the fossil fuels industry,” continued Hentges, a lawyer since",

They stared out a window at Kotzebue Sound, an arm of the Chukchi Sea at the southern edge of the Arctic Ocean. Outside it was 35 degrees and raining. “Too warm,” said one of the men. His companion let a long silence pass. Then he nodded. “Too much rain,” he said. Indeed. In Kotzebue, November temperatures normally hover in the single digits. But these aren’t normal times. This is the time of “the changes” — a term used by Caleb Pungowiyi, former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and one of Kotzebue’s most respected elders, when talking about the effects of climate change in the Alaskan Arctic. “Some events like this happen occasionally,” Pungowiyi told me as we sat looking out at the rain. “But for something to happen that’s this warm, in November, for a number of days — these kinds of temperatures are not normal. We should be down in the teens and minus temperatures this time of year.” A few days of rainy weather isn’t climate, but it is a powerful data point. You get enough warm, rainy days like this, and pretty soon they add up. This is how climate change happens in the far north: one warm rainy day at a time.

    "content": "The Arctic Ocean is so cold that only a handful of fish and marine mammals can survive there. Subsurface temperatures range from 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit on a warm summer day to 28.76 degrees, the freezing point of seawater. In those extreme conditions, one fish species in the center of the Arctic food web is uniquely equipped to thrive: the Arctic cod. A slender and smaller cousin of the Pacific and Atlantic cod, the Arctic cod is often seen near the underside of the ice, feeding on pteropods, copepods, krill, worms, and small fish. It uses cracks and seams in the ice much as tropical fish use a coral reef: as a refuge from predators. Its survival in these heat-sapping waters depends on two things: blood and fat. Arctic cod blood is a biological marvel. The fish survives thanks to a special protein that acts as an antifreeze, preventing the blood from crystallizing at temperatures below freezing. As for the fat, it is hard to overstate its importance to the health of the entire Arctic food web. Pound for pound, Arctic cod contain nearly twice the energy of groundfish like pollock, which thrive in the subarctic region of the North Pacific. For animals in the Arctic, where every calorie is dearly earned and spent, that’s a massive bang for the buck. The Bering Strait acts as the border between the Pacific and the Arctic Ocean. But man-made distinctions mean little in the biological world. What really separates Arctic from subarctic species is the Bering Sea cold pool, a tongue of near-freezing seawater that constantly expands and recedes south from the strait. During warmer summer months, some subarctic species like pollock and flounder can move into Arctic waters, but the winter cold pool eventually drives them back south. Since the early",

Fossil and DNA records suggest that the white bears began diverging from brown bears around 200,000 years ago. “Some brown bear populations figured out that all these little sausages were available out there on the ice,” said biologist Brendan Kelly of the University of Alaska, “and with their powerful noses, the bears could easily smell out the seals.” Brown bears, especially the North American grizzly subspecies, are famously omnivorous. Their food web ranges from roots and berries to salmon and deer. Diet largely determines their size. The Kodiak subspecies is the largest — they rival polar bears in size — because Kodiaks consume massive amounts of southwestern Alaska’s protein- and fat-rich salmon. Polar bears, by contrast, subsist almost entirely on Arctic ice seals, chiefly ringed and bearded seals. No other food comes close to providing the amounts of fat the bear needs to survive the Arctic’s extreme cold. “To a polar bear, seals are giant fat pills swimming around out there,” says Steven Amstrup, a former U.S. Geological Survey wildlife biologist who is now the chief scientist for Polar Bears International. Amstrup has been studying the Alaskan population for more than 30 years. The U.S. Department of the Interior relied heavily on his research when it conferred threatened status on the bear in May",

    "date": "2011-02-13T09:53:13-05:00",
    "content": "China has announced a billion dollars in emergency water aid to ease its most severe drought in 60 years, as the United Nations warned of a threat to the harvest of the world’s biggest wheat producer. Beijing has also promised to use its grain reserves to reduce the pressure on global food prices, which have surged in the past year to record highs due to the floods in Australia and a protracted dry spell in Russia. The desperate measures were evident at Baita reservoir in Shandong — one of several key agricultural provinces afflicted by four months without rain. With nearby crops turning yellow, a mechanical digger cut a crude, open-cast well into the dried-up bed of the reservoir. Muddy water from the 16-foot-deep pit was pumped up to the surface via a hose that snaked past a fishing boat stranded on the cracked earth. As the water spluttered on to his wheat field, farmer Liu Baojin expressed concern the support may have come too late. Despite the emergency well digging and partial compensation from the government, he fears he may have to seek work in the city if his harvest fails. “I guess a third of my crops have already died,” he said. “I’m very worried. I’ve never seen such a dry spell.” The problems are compounded by the growing water demands of cities and industry. On the outskirts of Sishui — which translates as Four Waters due to its historic abundance of rivers and sprints — villagers complain that they are not allowed to use the Si river that runs past their homes because the water is earmarked for the Huajin paper mill and an artificial lake in a nearby urban development. “We can’t use our own water. The local officials want to keep it so they can show a ‘green face’ to the big-shot leaders from Beijing,” said a peanut and cotton farmer who gave the surname Liu. “We are very angry. But we are afraid to complain.” Local newspapers have been filled with stories of the drought’s impact on the “wheat basket” provinces of Henan, Anhui and Hunan. About 2.6 million people and 2.8 million livestock are affected. To induce precipitation, the army and meteorological officials have fired cloud-seeding chemicals into the sky. A light overnight fall of snow raised hopes that the drought may be about to break, but the Shandong Climate Centre said it stopped at 0.4 centimeters — only enough to dust the fields. “It’s too little to make any difference,” said Kong Dekun, who farms land near the mythical birthplace of Confucius in Fuzidong. “We should have had at least two big snowfalls by now.” The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization issued an alert on February 8. “The ongoing drought is potentially a very serious problem,” it said, noting that the affected area of 12.75 million acres represented two-thirds of China’s wheat production. This has added to upward pressure on global wheat prices, which surged 76 percent last year due to a combination of speculation, rising demand and climatic impacts on production in Canada, Australia, Europe and Russia.

    "content": "WASHINGTON—If Sen. Jim Inhofe was even remotely thinking about adding Mark Hertsgaard’s newest book to his reading list, he likely shelved that idea around noon Tuesday. That’s when the independent California journalist and the Republican Oklahoma senator wrapped up a pointed but cordial — and somewhat convoluted — five-minute exchange about global warming. Hertsgaard is the author of the mid-January release “Hot: Living Through the Next Fifty Years.” He cornered Inhofe near a bank of members-only elevators at the Dirksen Senate Office Building to ask how he could remain the Senate’s most adamant climate change denier when every noted scientific organization agrees the planet and its inhabitants are destined for a world of hurt unless heat-trapping gases are tamed. “Yeah, are you kidding?” he told SolveClimate News when asked if it was worth it to wait 85 minutes in a windowless Dirksen hallway until Inhofe emerged from a fourth-floor committee hearing room. “For my daughter’s sake I want to know why he thinks he can do that.” “Hot,” the most recent of his six environmental tomes, is dedicated to his 5-year-old daughter Chiara. She has inspired the 54-year-old’s fatherly concern toward what he calls Generation Hot, the two billion youngsters worldwide now forced to cope with climate disruption. Even though it was just 24 hours after Valentine’s Day, Hertsgaard didn’t come to Capitol Hill expecting to sway hearts — or even minds — on the climate change front. Instead, Tuesday’s event to confront “climate cranks” — coordinated by partners including the Sierra Club, 350.org, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network and The Nation — offered a lesson to budding activists on staking out politicians and a chance for Hertsgaard to vent. Throughout the day, the energetic author was trailed by four young local organizers, a couple of communications specialists and three videographers. “I think he knows his lines,” Hertsgaard said about trying to push the envelope with Inhofe. “He should. He’s been saying the same thing for 20 years.” Frustration with Media Coverage During the Hertsgaard encounter, Inhofe offered the same nay-saying spiel he offered the week before at a House subpanel hearing on draft legislation he’s behind to stymie the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon emissions. And Matt Dempsey, communications manager for his boss — the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee — backed him up on every point. But, then again, what did the activists expect when hitting the skeptic jackpot? For one, Inhofe famously labeled global warming “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” And, last winter he questioned the science further when his family built an igloo and mockingly christened it former Vice President Al Gore’s home after “Snowmageddon” buried the nation’s capital. Hertsgaard, who has written for the likes of The New Yorker, Time, Vanity Fair, The Nation and Politico and reported for National Public Radio, insists that the “mainstream media” are to blame for giving congressional deniers a pass. On Tuesday, he confronted Inhofe on each of his points about the science being “mixed,” the dire impact of carbon controls on the economy and what little difference EPA action will have on global emissions. “It’s important to say, ‘No senator, the science is not mixed.’ But a lot of mainstream reporters don’t argue back,” Hertsgaard said in an interview, adding that a sense of false balance can be attributed to a Washington press corps not familiar with environmental issues. “But virtually every science organization tells us climate change is real and very dangerous. It’s a matter of demonstrable science not opinion. To pretend otherwise borders on journalistic malpractice.” Hertsgaard is embarrassed to hail from a country with a political party that denies climate change, adding that European conservative parties argue about policy, not science. Here, he continued, Republicans reject the science because of its political implications — mandatory government regulations imposed economy-wide. “We’re in such a bizarre political bubble in Washington, D.C.,” he noted during the brisk walk to Dirksen. “And that wouldn’t happen if we didn’t have Fox TV amplifying the argument and the mainstream media caving into this false neutrality.” Environmental Dollars in Jeopardy Organizers chose Tuesday to act because it fit into Hertsgaard’s schedule, plus both the House and Senate are in session. However, it also coincides with GOP efforts to cause mischief with the EPA’s",

Bremby made his first public appearance yesterday since losing his job as secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) in early November. He said he had been forced out by then-Gov. Mark Parkinson while a second permit application was pending for a controversial coal-fired power plant in western Kansas that had gained national notoriety. After a 90-minute presentation to about 75 people on issues of sustainability and the coal plant project, Bremby said in an interview that he was shocked and dismayed to lose his job. He said he wasn’t told why he was let go. “I have a sense internally what the issue may have been, but I don’t want to suggest anything in particular because I don’t want to impugn anyone’s character,” Bremby told SolveClimate News. Bremby said he got a call on Nov. 2, Election Day, from Parkinson’s legal counsel and chief of staff telling him the governor wanted him to step down as secretary of the state environment agency and instead serve on a transition team to help Governor-elect Sam Brownback. Bremby responded that he thought he could do both jobs but was told that he was being terminated as secretary. After agreeing not to say anything about his departure until Parkinson left office in January, he was put on leave with pay. “I didn’t quit,” Bremby said. He added that he was shocked by the turn of events but was aware he served at the pleasure of the governor. “It was not pleasant, but stuff happens.” Parkinson’s office declined at the time to make any connection between Bremby’s departure and the coal plant issue. Bremby said on Thursday he was disturbed by the permit application process, including the “staggering” amount of lobbying dollars that went into supporting the project in Kansas. “That must not happen again,” he said. Bremby’s successor at the KDHE, John Mitchell, approved the permit in mid-December for the 895-megawatt coal fired plant proposed by Sunflower Electric Power Corp, near Holcomb, Kansas. Pressure was building to approve the permit before January 2, when the application would have become subject to Environmental Protection Agency rules on carbon dioxide that would kick in.

Areas suitable for growing wine grapes in the United States, the fourth largest wine producer behind France, Italy and Spain, could shrink by as much as 81 percent by the end of the century due to rising temperatures, according to research published in the National Academy of Sciences. The Northern California Napa and Sonoma valleys would be hit the hardest. Climate change would trigger more extreme heat waves, harming premium wine grapes that need stable temperatures to flourish by causing them to overripen from too much sugar. California’s wine industry accounts for up to three percent of the state’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to government estimates. Thrupp says she has made it her goal to help vineyards bring the industry’s CO2 footprint to zero.

But publicly known efforts reveal how adaptation is taking center stage for businesses with vulnerable supply chains, amid mostly feeble attempts by the world’s largest carbon polluters to cut greenhouse gas emissions. “It creepingly has become apparent that even if mitigation were highly successful — which so far it’s not — we’d still have lots of climate impacts,” said Armando Carbonell, senior fellow and chair of the Department of Planning and Urban Form at the Cambridge, Mass.-based Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. “We have to adapt,” he told SolveClimate News. Energy giant Entergy Corporation would seem to agree. On Tuesday, the utility will announce an adaptation project with New Orleans-based nonprofit America’s WETLAND Foundation and government officials from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The collaboration seeks to help a dozen communities along the U.S. Gulf Coast gauge their vulnerabilities to climate change, and establish plans to deal with the impacts. Entergy, a Fortune 500 utility and the nation’s second-largest nuclear energy provider, delivers power to nearly 3 million customers across most of Louisiana and Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Texas. “Our service area is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,” said Brent Dorsey, director of the firm’s corporate environmental programs, adding that “electric systems do not do real well under water.” ‘Before it Gets to Be a Crisis’ “We ought to start working to come up with adaptive solutions before it gets to be a crisis,” he told SolveClimate News. Val Marmillion, managing director of America’s WETLAND Foundation, said Entergy’s adaptation goals are not about politics, but economics. “We’re in the reality, and not into the debate,” Marmillion told SolveClimate News, referring to ongoing skepticism by some in Washington about whether climate change is a man-made crisis. We “are not treating climate or sea-level rise as a political issue.” “The Gulf Coast is deteriorating at a very rapid rate,” he continued, putting communities in the region in danger. Marmillion attributes the downfall to what he calls a trifecta of problems: the severe decline of wetlands, the muddying of the Mississippi River and an accelerated rise in sea levels from global warming. Last fall, America’s WETLAND Foundation released an Entergy-sponsored analysis showing that the Gulf Coast region could suffer more than $350 billion in economic losses over the coming decades from climate damage. According to Dorsey, Hurricane Katrina was a major wake-up call to the utility. Two of the company’s natural gas power plants drowned under water, though its nuclear facility in Louisiana, located north of the city on higher ground, was spared. Entergy’s corporate headquarters in New Orleans was shut down for 10 months following the disaster, and it ended up building temporary tent cities for some of its contractors and employees. “We had a temporary relocation until the city was back to normal enough to be able to support business,” Dorsey said. As an immediate adaptation response, the utility has geographically dispersed its operations to avoid a similar disruption in the event of another extreme weather event, Dorsey explained. Starbucks: Coffee Farms ‘Vulnerable’ For its part, Seattle-based coffee titan Starbucks is worried about a major warming-related supply disturbance in a decade or two in areas where its beans are grown, said Jim Hanna, director of environmental impact and global responsibility at Starbucks. “Regions where our coffee comes from are most vulnerable to the impacts of more immediate climate change,” he said. Climate-related threats to bean production include increased flooding, droughts and erosion, and greater pest infestation. Growing good coffee beans is like developing a fine wine, Hanna told SolveClimate News in an interview. Changes in microclimate can have an impact on the caliber of the bean, and already some farmers have begun moving their farms to higher altitudes to maintain quality, he said. In vulnerable coffee-growing areas in Mexico and Indonesia, Starbucks has partnered with Arlington, Va.-based Conservation International to work on ways to handle weather variability. “Arabica coffee production requires well-defined dry and wet seasons, and changes to rainfall patterns may impact yields,” said Terry Hills, technical adviser on climate change adaptation for Conservation International. Higher temperatures during critical growth periods can also reduce yields. “Some of our project sites appear to be facing challenges typically associated with increased climate variability and change,” Hills told SolveClimate News, citing the significant landslides that occurred in Nueva Columbia in Chiapas, Mexico, last September. However, he noted that blaming specific weather events on global warming is not always possible in the coffee-producing areas of Chiapas and in Sumatra, Indonesia, because there is a long history of climate variations there. “With climate change, it’s a slow trickle of changing conditions,” said Hanna of Starbucks. Steps taken to improve the quality of coffee beans — such as growing them in shade — can protect the plants during major weather events such as hurricanes, he said. While both organizations were leery to admit that adaptation to warming is a primary objective of their collaboration, it is certainly part of their work. “For example, in the case of Sumatra, we are looking at climate change impact models to establish what the science says about likely climate futures, and also listening to the farmers on their experience with changing conditions and their ideas on solutions,” Hills said. “Both sets of information help us to build climate-resilient practices into the farmer training program that underpins this work.” Reticence to Reveal Adaptation Plans Surprisingly, some corporations active on environmental and sustainability issues are far more reticent than Entergy and Stabucks to dislcose their adaptation plans, observers note. “While people in a lot of companies realize talking about sustainability is important, you don’t have a lot of champion companies stepping out saying ‘climate change is a problem and we’re trying to do adaptation,'” Gregory Unruh, director of the Lincoln Center for Ethics in Global Management at the Thunderbird, told SolveClimate News. L. Hunter Lovins, president and founder of Natural Capitalism Solutions, says that “adaptation” has even become a bad word among some environmentalists, though for different reasons. “Activists are saying ‘don’t talk about it because people will stop mitigation,'” said Lovins, co-author of the upcoming “Climate Capitalism: Capitalism in the Age of Climate Change,” in an interview. But responses to climate change shouldn’t haven’t to be either/or, she said. “The best adaptation measures are mitigation measures that also enable you to better withstand whatever impact climate change imposes,” Lovins said. For instance, utilities that are improving energy efficiency to mitigate against global warming are also finding that it is an adaptation measure that will allow them to better deal with extreme heat events that require extra capacity. “Corporations need to realize that if they have a global supply chain, climate change disrupts shipping,” Lovins said, adding that companies might seek more local sourcing so they are less dependent on a disrupted global supply chain.

    "content": "The Fairtrade Foundation is hoping that new links between British retailers and small farmers can help tackle the impact of climate change on supplies of some of the world’s tastiest coffee. In the past year, coffee prices have soared to an all-time high as production of the most aromatic and widely used type of bean, arabica, has suffered from unusual weather conditions worldwide. Toby Quantrill, head of public policy for the foundation, which aims to guarantee a fair price for farmers in developing countries, said: “We are very concerned. The small-scale and poorer farmers we work with are the most vulnerable, and they need support.” The organization wants to act as a broker between retailers, which can buy carbon credits as a way of offsetting their energy use, and small farmers who can create credits to earn money by planting trees or using more environmentally friendly ways to light or heat their homes. Fairtrade’s move comes amid increasing concern among coffee buyers, particularly those working with small-scale farmers, about the security of supply. They fear not merely disappointment for those who enjoy their caffeine hit with a little more flavor and fragrance, but a global disaster for the coffee industry. Andrea Olivar at Twin Trading, which buys Fairtrade-approved coffee for supermarkets including Sainsbury’s, as well as specialist labels such as Traidcraft and Equal Exchange, said: “If roasters and supermarkets want to continue buying good-quality coffee, with all the changes in the climate, it could get difficult in future. The high-quality arabica bean only grows in specific conditions.” The problem is already apparent to coffee farmers in the Mbale region of Uganda, on the slopes of Mount Elgon, where it is feared that production of arabica beans could cease in the next decade. They are experiencing unprecedented levels of pests and disease, and struggling to deal with unpredictable weather conditions that are dramatically affecting coffee production. The bean flourishes at 18-23 degrees Celsius (64-73 degrees Fahrenheit), and in Mbale temperatures appear to be rising – a view held by local farmers and backed up by a recent study by Oxfam. Pest attack Willington Wamayeye, managing director of the Gumutindo Fairtrade coffee co-operative in Mbale, which buys from about 6,000 farmers in the region, said: “When temperatures rise we have a humid environment and it enables diseases and pests to grow, and we have unprecedented levels of pest attack of the coffee. In the past it was manageable – now it’s running out of control and you can see a whole garden of plants drying up. It’s like an epidemic.” He said 80 percent of coffee trees were now affected by pests compared with about 10 percent three or four years ago. In the past a coffee tree used to produce an average 2 kilogram of beans a year but now farmers are barely collecting 0.5 kilogram a tree. Quality is also being affected. While politicians stall on action to tackle climate change, Ugandan farmers are already being forced to deal with the daily reality of higher temperatures, drought and ill-timed or extreme rainfall. Wamayeye said: “The rivers I used to jump in when I was a small boy are completely dried up apart from when it rains heavily.” Heavy rains coupled with deforestation have also increased the incidence of landslides in the region, which can devastate farms and communities. In March last year, a school, a health center and several farms were buried after torrential rain. The fall in coffee production may be a less immediate problem but it does have implications for people in Uganda and beyond. As a lucrative cash crop, coffee is vital to smallholders in providing the money they need for medicines, daily household necessities such as soap and their children’s school fees. While coffee prices are high at the moment, amid increasing demand for high-quality Fairtrade organic coffee of the kind grown by the Gumutindo co-operative, farmers’ income is under pressure because yields are falling. Wamayeye says that, although his co-operative has taken on new farmers, this year he will not be able to meet demand: “I need to raise 40 containers of coffee. I have just fewer than 20 now and I think I will fall short by maybe 10 containers by the end of the season.” That reflects a wider problem in Uganda, where the government says exports of the lower-quality robusta coffee bean have also been hit. Between October and December, 692,485 bags of robusta coffee were shipped, down from 705,277 in the same quarter a year before. The Fairtrade Foundation is not alone in its endeavors to improve the situation. Partly thanks to the National Assembly for Wales, Mbale is being used to pilot schemes that can help these farmers adapt to climate change. A project orchestrated by the Welsh assembly is aiming to return Mbale’s bare hillsides to the lushly forested slopes they once were. The Cardiff-based Waterloo Foundation, set up by David and Heather Stevens, co-founders of part of insurers Admiral Group, has given £150,000 over three years towards planting about 1m trees in Uganda. The Waterloo Foundation project is seen as a pilot for a broader scheme, backed by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), to fund tree planting and other climate change adaptation initiatives. It has just secured $1m (£630,000) of funding for work in Mbale, one of 10 regions around the world that are expected to participate. After months of political wrangling, the UK’s Department for International Development has put up £300,000 over three years, with the rest coming from Denmark’s international development agency and the UNDP. Meanwhile other smaller projects are forging ahead. Twin Trading is asking coffee roasters in the UK to pay a slightly higher price in order to guarantee the future of supply through climate change-related projects, including responsible livestock farming, tree-planting and fuel-efficient stoves. Its cow-sharing project is starting this month and it is hoping to find a retail or roaster partner to help it continue the work. It is encouraged by a deal in which Cadbury’s, the British chocolate manufacturer acquired last year by the US group Kraft Foods, has committed to help cocoa farmers in Ghana adapt to climate change. But, as Wamayeye says, the farmers can only help themselves so much: “What we can do, we are doing. We can plant trees. We can’t stop people from driving or flying.” Photo: H.

    "content": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with more than 20 times greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide. Yet scientists admit that their knowledge about methane’s sources and movements through the carbon cycle is still incomplete. Two new studies published earlier this month in the journal Science chip away at this lack of knowledge. In one study, an international team of scientists reported new data showing that freshwater sources, such as lakes and streams, contribute more methane to the atmosphere than previously thought. The other study clarified how methane is consistently cleansed from the atmosphere. Together, they provide a clearer window on methane’s behavior in two places in the carbon cycle, improving the tool set scientists can use to track and measure the contribution of the greenhouse gas on warming global temperatures. Methane is produced in environments with little or no oxygen by bacteria that feast on decomposing organic matter, such as grasses and wood. Almost half of the world’s methane comes from natural sources such as wetlands, rivers and streams, gas hydrates on the ocean floor, and permafrost. Termites, surprisingly, are the second largest source of global natural methane emissions; they produce the gas as part of their normal digestive process. Human-related activity is responsible for the other half of global emissions. Methane is released from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transportation; from rice paddies, landfills, and from cattle. Atmospheric methane levels were relatively constant from",

Deforestation for timber and industrial palm oil, they say, is theft of the state’s natural heritage and betrayal of its most vulnerable citizens. Adding insult to injury, much of the money made by timber and palm oil barons, as well as by the Malaysian politicians they have corrupted, is not invested in the local economy, nor is it taxed; it’s exported. Much of the ill-gotten gains from massive logging are hidden in plain sight as real estate holdings. An investigation by an international network including The Borneo Project has uncovered a chain of destruction and deception in which loggers and their political patrons have acquired real estate empires stretching from the United States to Great Britain, from Australia to Canada. The Yaw family – whose fortune is based in Samling, one of Sarawak’s most notorious logging companies – appears to have used American properties as a kickback to the First Minister of Sarawak, Abdul Taib Mahmud, a possible quid pro quo for granting their vast logging concessions.

    "content": "The Obama administration put off for another three years a decision on whether to regulate planet-warming gases from biomass power. The surprise delay dealt a blow to green groups’ hopes for pollution controls on wood-burning incinerators anytime soon, while industry breathed sighs of relief. “It was a total shock,” said Margaret Sheehan, a lawyer with the Cambridge, Mass.-based Biomass Accountability Project, who said that she believes Big Timber was behind the U.S. EPA’s decision. Dan Whiting, spokesperson for the National Alliance for Forest Owners (NAFO), an organization of private forest owners in 47 states, said he was “pleasantly surprised.” Still, the delay leaves wide open a question central to the industry’s future: Should turning tree parts into electricity qualify as clean renewable power in the eyes of government regulators, or should biomass emissions be regarded as a source of greenhouse gas pollution? The verdict on that, however it is decided, will have major implications for developers of the $1 billion industry and U.S. states striving to meet clean energy targets. Biomass includes plant waste, wood chips, organic debris and whole trees, and industry representatives say burning it is “carbon neutral.” They argue that new growth absorbs CO2 and cancels out emissions spewed into the atmosphere from burning the wood. “Biomass greenhouse gas emissions … are part of the natural carbon cycle, and they don’t increase carbon in the atmosphere,” Whiting told SolveClimate News. Conservationists dispute that claim with a very different understanding of what constitutes the natural carbon cycle. Rotting biomass enriches soils, which capture and sequester some of the carbon of the once-living plant tissue. They argue that biomass combustion produces more CO2 than burning fossil fuels — by how much varies depending on the type of materials and how they are transported. Harvesting whole trees is seen as the worst for climate change. But Sheehan said that using logging leftovers is not much better. “It’s not really waste. It’s part of a natural carbon cycle. If we vacuum up the forest floor to burn all the twigs and leftover debris, then they will continue to deplete our soil,” she told SolveClimate News. EPA said it would bring the best science to bear on the issues over the next three years. By July",

    "date": "2011-01-10T12:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "(This is the second of two parts. Click here for Part 1) Fortunately for them, the young leaders committed to broadening the green base enjoy the privilege of having inherited a billion-dollar movement infrastructure: offices, websites, and, most important, membership lists. Everyone I spoke with was appreciative of this fact, and had nothing but kind things to say about the people who came before them. “Our predecessors did an amazing job with what they had,” Jennifer Krill, the 38-year-old head of the mining and natural gas watchdog group Earthworks said. At the same time, there’s a feeling that the legal and regulatory tactics that have become the bread and butter for so many environmental groups may have reached the limits of their effectiveness. “At some point in the late seventies, early eighties, we got really aggressive and successful at lobbying Capitol Hill and the White House, and that was a transition from being more of a grassroots environmental community,” Pica said. “And I think that the successes that we had … I think we took some of the wrong lessons away. That transformed the movement into this lawyerly, regulatory, DC Beltway-focused community. And we’ve kind of forgotten, neglected the power base that got us to that point.” To be fair, lawsuits and lobbying have been useful for enforcing – and, when under threat, defending – the country’s landmark environmental laws. The attorney-centric NRDC, for example, has played an invaluable role in preventing rollbacks of earlier gains. But the insider strategy is unlikely to build the popular momentum needed to address the twenty-first-century threats to the environment. You’re not going to overhaul the foundation of industrial society with a relatively small group of lawyers and scientific experts. “There’s a decreasing return on investment for this strategy of the dominant DC groups,” Radford said, “investing in smart policy people, but not investing in the grassroots.” I heard some variation of “investing in the grassroots” from almost everyone I spoke with. To do that successfully, the new leaders must overcome challenges their predecessors didn’t face – most notably, a graying membership and the tricky terrain of the internet. Over the last 40 years, the green groups have built large lists of members mostly through direct mail. Now that membership is aging, and the twenty- and thirty-somethings coming up behind are immune to the mail request. This poses a threat to green groups’ political strength and their financial health. Of course, many younger people do have a sense of civic engagement: The Obama campaign’s success with the Millennial Generation proved as much. But they engage in a different fashion – online. And that represents the second major challenge for the new leaders’ aspirations: finding a way to ensure that internet activism is just as effective as the tried-and-true tactics of marching and petitioning and calling your legislator. This isn’t easy. In the last decade, figuring out how to convert online “awareness raising” to real world action has become the Philosopher’s Stone of political organizing. When it works, the Internet can be an awesome tool for social change, as proven by the continued strength of the 4 million-member Moveon.org. But sometimes it becomes simply “clicktivism” – mouse maneuvering as a substitute for real organizing. Greenpeace’s Radford is one of the leaders who has had some success in growing membership. As Greenpeace’s organizing director, he increased membership from 100,000 people to 280,000 people, a success that propelled his precocious rise. He accomplished this mostly through old-school canvassing – college kids with clipboards going door-to-door and standing on street corners. The result, Radford said, is a membership more likely to take action when it comes time to press a campaign. “If you’re saying, ‘Hey, do you want a cloth tote?’ then you see your numbers jump dramatically,” he said. “But what you end up with is a donor pool that responds far less to your mission or things that are just about taking action or being part of something bigger. It’s just a really different dynamic.” Of all the environmental organizations, 350.org has probably been the most successful at translating online connections into real-world actions. The group has built a global activist community knit together by, of all things, a number referring to parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “When we set out with 350, we really were trying to spread it as a meme, and the day of action was a tool to do that,” said May Boeve, another 350 organizer. Boeve (rhymes with movie) is a California blonde who, like most of the 350 staff, started working with McKibben while a student at Middlebury College. The 350 staff is organized as a consensus-based collective, but with her executive focus and force of personality, Boeve operates as the de facto chief of staff. “I don’t know if there’s any campaign comparable to ours where all of these people all around the world who aren’t on the payroll and who we don’t even know send us 350 photos and set up their own 350 chapters. I think we were effective at trying all kinds of things just to get the number out there, and brand it as a symbol of climate safety and the science, but as something you could belong to.” Another challenge of today’s political organizing is how to connect with the public in an era in which a certain sardonic attitude has become the default cultural language. Part of 350’s success comes from its knack for communicating in a tone that appeals to people under, say, 35. The earnest appeals of yesteryear are a poor match for the zeitgeist of Stephen Colbert and Sarah Silverman. But issues like climate change and mercury poisoning are big time serious. So how do you balance a sober point with a lighthearted message? “Our generation, we are so used to a personal type of interaction,” Henn said. “We’ve tried to embody that in our emails and our communications. Our blog is not super polished, it’s written in an off-the-cuff sort of way. Our e-mails from Bill are infused with this long-format, writerly voice. It has to be fused with a real sense of personality, especially over email and especially on the Web. My theory on writing e-mail blasts is that if you wouldn’t write this way to your friends, you probably shouldn’t write that way to your members.” “Strategic irreverence, I’ll call it,” Becky Tarbotton, the new executive director of Rainforest Action Network said to me. “The work has to be fun, inspiring, energizing, and sexy. We’re not going to attract people with a sign that says, ‘The End is Near’ – even if it is. Irreverence is about inviting people from all walks of life, rather than chastising them for not already being with us.” If the new generation of leaders intuitively gets how to how to mix earnestness with humor and connect with a younger audience, it’s because, well, they’re them. And as Atari babies – or, “net natives” like Boeve and Henn – they aren’t flummoxed by technology. These generation-specific sensibilities mark a real culture shift for environmental activism. The willingness to be off-the-cuff is one of the big differences between the young leaders’ and their predecessors. The new leaders are confident they can ditch the focus-grouped, poll-tested language that many organizations depend on, and speak in a language that is more emotional. The overly scripted appeal, they feel, is no longer working. Today’s Millennial Generation – awash in marketing and hype – has an exquisitely attuned bullshit meter, and it isn’t swayed by spin. “This new generation sees through messaging frames that aren’t authentic, sees through solutions that are only halfway there, that aren’t real solutions,” said Jessy Tolkan, the 29-year-old former director of Energy Action, the largest campus coalition working on climate (and an Earth Island-sponsored project). “I have to say that the work I have done to mobilize young people to work on environmental issues has reinforced to me how important it is to be authentic.” According to many people I spoke to, a lack of authenticity helped doom the Senate climate legislation. The environmental organizations that spearheaded the fight weren’t completely honest with people about whether the proposed solution matched the scale of the problem, and in the process they lost their supporters. The eco-base simply was not buying the proposition that a market-based cap-and-trade deal – agreed upon with corporate America and full of compromises – could head off catastrophic global climate change. “We have to be able to call balls and strikes, as the champions of protecting the planet,” Pica said. “This is true up and down the generational board – you have to have some integrity in how you communicate. If you lose the battle of who is more trustworthy, then you lose your audience, whoever you are talking to.” You Gotta Have Faith “We have to build a movement.” That has to be the most tired phrase of center-left organizing retreats, campaigner e-mail listserves, and op-eds in The Nation. Most progressives – aware of how much US history has been driven from below – intuitively understand that only street heat can overcome the corporate cash and political corruption. On this point, few in the environmental movement disagree. “Who would say, ‘No, we don’t need better, smarter organizing?” Brune said to me. The question, then, is how exactly. Finding the answer represents the biggest test for the new crop of young leaders, who have before them an opportunity to redefine environmentalism, redefine what it means to be an environmentalist, and even, perhaps, build something that transcends those labels. In talking about the necessity of base building, the green leaders I spoke to often referred to the hard work (and ultimate victories) of the civil rights movement. It’s a useful analogy – until it’s not. Because there’s one major difference between the efforts of Ella Baker and Baynard Rustin and the environmental community as it exists today: passion. The fact is, despite the best of efforts, environmental issues don’t strike a visceral chord with many Americans. Unlike the LGBT movement (in which people are demanding basic civil rights) or the labor movement (which combines enlightened self-interest with a broader call for social justice), environmentalism can seem detached. It’s often about saving far-off places or eliminating chemicals we can’t see, much less pronounce. There’s a lot of jargon. The result is a political movement that – aside from the tiny EarthFirst! contingent and the fever of animal rights activists – can often feel emotionless. Or like emotion without context, like screaming that the house is on fire when nobody can feel the heat. “You have to go where people’s passion is, you have to,” Justin Reuben, the 37-year-old executive director of Moveon.org, said to me. “You have to be doing the stuff that when people look it they say, ‘Hell, yeah.’” One of greens’ biggest hurdles in getting to that “hell yeah” moment is what I would call the problem of eco-empathy. The threats to our shared environment are so big that it’s hard to attach emotion to them. Global climate change is the best example. Green campaigners sometimes complain that global warming is “hard to understand.” True enough. But it’s not just that climate change boggles the mind – it also turns off the heart. Emotions depend on closeness. Yet the most worrisome of environmental threats is planetary in scale. We simply don’t know where to begin feeling. “I think that with climate we’ve been talking about it on such a huge scale, and with such a sense of apocalypse that it’s hard for people to wrap their minds around it,” Henn said. “Not that they don’t care, but they can’t feel at that level.” How do you get around this problem? Several people suggested that the answer is to internalize some of the wisdom of the old bumper sticker, Think Global Act Local. The best way to grow the movement for sustainability is by putting new emphasis on the threats – and the solutions – that are near to people’s homes … and close to their hearts. The successful effort to stop proposed coal-fired power plants offers one model of how to do that. In the last few years, a coalition of more than 100 organizations – from big groups like the Sierra Club and NRDC to small, local outfits – have prevented the construction of 131 coal plants. And they have done so without having to rely on single vote in Congress. The anti-coal battle has been won, Brune told me, because it connects so organically to home-front issues like air pollution, water pollution, and public health. “It was very local, people could look out their windows and see this giant coal plant spewing pollution into the air, or the prospect of another coal plant being built that would do the same, and they had a very tangible way to stop that plant from being built, or to shut it down,” he said. “We’re not just appealing to one constituency that cares about climate. There is a broader, more diverse coalition of groups that can be brought together.” Perhaps what’s needed, as I wrote in my notebook while listening to Brune, is for “the sustainability movement to focus on a livability agenda.” Because when greens emphasize basic quality of life issues, they gain the opportunity to push a broad-based (and non-partisan) agenda. The potency of a livability agenda can be glimpsed in the popularity of the sustainable food movement, as organic farms take root even in dark-red communities like Louisiana and Texas. Livability also meets sustainability when it comes to the widespread frustration with suburban sprawl; even in conservative Phoenix, light rail is popular. And of course livability comes into play in the continuing strong public support for the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, which can fuel those local struggles against dirty energy. Another example is the growing opposition to natural gas extraction. The battle against what’s known as “fracking” is gaining force because it has the immediacy that drives emotion: People will fight to keep their drinking water clean. “Eight-hundred thousand natural gas wells spread out across the United States as of",

Though “global headquarters” might be over-stating things: The offices consist of three rooms with worn carpeting and a collection of reclaimed desks arranged in a Tetris-like pattern. When I visited on a sunny afternoon in mid-September, the place was strangely silent given that the campaigners were just weeks from another worldwide demonstration demanding sharp greenhouse gas reductions. The organizers had already registered 2,700 events in 100 countries scheduled for 10-10-10; by the time the date arrived, they would clock in about 7,300 actions across the globe. Yet the office had none of the war-room frenzy one associates with a political operation in the lead-up to election day. The young and stylish – if rumpled – campaigners were at their desks quietly sending out emails, zipping instant messages, updating blogs, and posting Twitter updates. To my disappointment, there was no map on the wall full of pins marking confirmed actions. No one was on the phone shouting something like, “Get me Bogota!” The only sound was the click of keyboards. “I wish we could still campaign like that,” Jamie Henn, one of the 350’s organizers said wryly as we sat down at the beat-up wood table that doubles as conference and lunch space. Henn has a disarrayed shock of red hair and dark-frame glasses, which makes him look like the lost member of some art-rock band. He is also, true to type, scary-smart. A second after joking about old-school campaigning, he was holding forth on the state of the environmental movement and theories of social change. “There’s been a sense that’s been missing from the movement about what we are really up against. People use the metaphor a lot of World War II and a World War II-like mobilization. That mobilization didn’t happen because people suddenly got really excited about manufacturing. That mobilization happened because there was a real threat that people felt very personally.” Well said, I thought. And even more impressive given the fact that Henn, like the rest of the 350.org organizers, is 26 years old. With the exception of a couple contractors hired for the weeks before 10-10-10, the entire 350 staff is half the age of the campaign’s spokesman and (unpaid) figurehead, author-activist Bill McKibben.

    "content": "Ten years ago, I ended up on the mud flats of the Nile delta with a water engineer. He explained how everything we could see around us would be under water if sea levels rose as they are predicted to do – the nearby city of Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable to climate change in the world. It was just before a major conference on climate change, and the aim had been to find stories – and images – of global warming that got beyond the cliche of a melting ice cap. But as a journalist it was hard to bring this future to life; this sleepy bit of coastline hardly evoked the sense of urgency required to mobilise the international attention needed. This is the central paradox of climate change politics, argued the sociologist, Anthony Giddens, that electorates can’t grasp the significance of climate change because it is too abstract, and not dramatic enough (they need catastrophe footage), and won’t – until it’s too late. By the time we are experiencing massive floods, freak weather, sea-level rises and higher temperatures, we will be well past the point of doing anything about it. He christened it Giddens paradox. Ten years on, the impact of climate change is frighteningly more concrete. In the remote town of Anakila in Mali, west Africa, I find what we were looking for in the Nile delta 10 years ago. Campaigners know the power of images to drive the message home, and that’s why the aid agency Tearfund took me on a 1,000km journey from the capital, Bamako. Three hours after we left the paved road, we arrived at low mud houses clustered under large mango trees. This is part of the Sahel, and the nine months of the dry season have always left a narrow ecological perch for the community and its subsistence agriculture. They are poor, yet the town is vibrant; the Dogon people are much admired in Mali for their resourcefulness and hard work. Circling the town are the small vegetable gardens on which they depend. Looming Sand Dune For years now, the elders explain, they have been worried by climate change. Disrupted rain patterns, shifts in winds have no parallel in collective memory; they notice how it is prompting changes in the behaviour of animals and birds. But all of these anxieties are dwarfed by the sand dune now looming above their town – the result of those drier, fierce winds and erratic, intense rainfall. The dune stands several hundred feet high, spilling into the river and stemming its flow, slowly burying trees whose trunks are now deep in soft white sand. Plenty of fields have been swallowed by the sand already. The villagers’ defences against further encroachment are hedges of euphorbia – they surround the rows of sorghum that stand pitifully in ground which is more sand than soil. The dune glows golden in the sun, a dramatic and unfamiliar eruption in the landscape. This area was once forest, but gradual deforestation has thinned the tree cover and exposed the sandy soils. The dune is moving inexorably towards the outskirts of Anakila. It’s a sinister sign of the vulnerability of the Sahel, the grasslands that border the Sahara in a swath across Africa, and where millions have farmed and herded cattle for centuries. The ecological niche in which they have built their lives has always been full of uncertainties – and often hardship – but now the niche on which they have built cultures of great sophistication and resilience is shrinking beneath them as desert threatens. From Charity to Environmental Justice This is another paradox of climate-change politics: it is in remote places like this that climate change will hit first and hardest. It is cultures built on deep understanding of their environment – whether the Sami of the Arctic or the Dogon of the Sahara – whose way of life is the first to be threatened. Anakila’s residents are the canaries down the mine, their experience a foretaste of an Earth hostile to human inhabitation. But their experience of threat, potential devastation and loss of livelihood is discounted and ignored. No dunes are threatening Manchester. But Anakila’s plight will come back to haunt us in two ways. The entire debate around Africa and aid will shift in coming years from one dominated by charity and post-imperial responsibility to one framed primarily around environmental justice. The continent is one of the most vulnerable, with many of its delicate ecosystems threatened, as Camilla Toulmin’s charts in her book, Climate Change in Africa. It is also the least well equipped to respond – and the least responsible for the coming calamities. Media attention on the climate change talks in Cancún focus on the negotiations over emission cuts, but equally important is the financing of climate adaptation – at Copenhagen $100bn a year by",

Flashfloods and mudslides killed 233 people and damaged 14.2 square kilometres of agricultural land. Tucked high up in the western Himalayas, Ladakh is a sparsely populated, rugged desert where people struggle to turn barren and parched soil into cultivable land. The soil of Ladakh is not fertile and absorbs little water. Average rainfall is only 50 to 70 millimetres a year. In these adverse conditions, farming is an unenviable task, but diligent farmers, with support from NGOs, have created an irrigation network covering 50 square kilometres of agricultural land in Ladakh. This allows them to live off the land, against the odds. But nothing prepared farmers for August’s weather events. Unprecedented cloudbursts triggered flash floods, which in turn deposited thick layers of debris on the agricultural land and destroyed over 70% of the irrigation network built up by the farmers over years of hard work. “Crops can only be cultivated on this land after the flood debris is cleared and the top soil is exposed,” said Lobzang Tsultim, director of local NGO Leh Nutrition Project. “Obviously, the farmers can’t clear this debris manually, they need JCB machines, which the government and NGOs need to provide to them.” According to Tsultim, the government and non-profit groups are making no effort to restore the damaged land, on which the farmers’ livelihoods depend, to its original state.

Local Evidence Becomes Continental Trend Global warming temperatures rise the closer you get to the two poles. So Ziska and his colleagues have worked on the assumption that the closer North American ragweed grows to the North Pole, the stronger the reaction of the plants to CO2. In theory, this scenario would result in a higher rate of growth, a longer growing season and intensified pollen production.

    "date": "2010-11-09T13:00:00-05:00",
    "content": "A new online science project from British climate researchers is tapping into the power of crowdsourcing to enrich the historic climate record. In the next six months alone, Old Weather’s citizen scientists may process data that would take a single researcher 28 years to tackle. Through OldWeather.org, which launched in late October, volunteers log weather observations from more than 200 World War I–era British naval ship logs. Scientists will use that data to paint a clearer picture of past weather and make predictions about the weather of the future—including potential impacts of climate change—and to test and refine climate models. “We built models, but we want to know if they’re any good,” said Philip Brohan of the Met Office: Hadley Centre, one of the UK’s leading climate change research centers, and one of the climate scientists behind Old Weather. “We need big databases and long records.” An ocean of meticulously recorded weather observations is locked up in ships’ logs from countries around the world and could feed such databases. The sheer volume of data is too large for scientists to process on their own. That’s why the climate scientists turned to Zooniverse, a popular network of interactive citizen science projects investigating galaxies, the sun and the moon developed by a team including Chris Lintott, an astronomer from the University of Oxford, that has lead to a series of scientific discoveries. Old Weather is its first nonastronomy project. Citizen science is nothing new, Lintott said, but while traditionally laypeople have supplied observational data, now scientists need their help processing it. How It Works Old Weather volunteers don’t need any climate or historical expertise—just the ability to decipher the sometimes-spidery handwriting of early 20th-century sailors. People are more adept than computers at reading and interpreting handwritten logs. After selecting a ship, a user sees a scanned image of an actual page from the the ship’s logbook. Zooming in with a built-in magnifying tool, the user finds the weather data and types it into a color-coded pop-up box. Volunteers start out as “cadets” but can be “promoted” all the way to ship captain as they digitize more pages. For the initial project, volunteers are recording information from the logs for 238 ships, including wind speed and direction, air and water temperature and observations about events on the ship. To ensure accuracy, multiple volunteers log each page. The information gathered through the project will be processed by Hadley Centre’s scientists and entered into international historical weather databases, where it can be accessed and used by other researchers. “There’s a huge need” for quality historical weather data, especially from the world’s oceans, since most climate records are from land-based data, said Brenda Ekwurzel, assistant director of climate research and analysis for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy organization. “We don’t have the type of information we’d like.” One group that likely will employ Old Weather’s data is climateprediction.net, a project of University of Oxford and other UK institutions that bills itself as “the world’s largest climate forecasting experiment.” It’s a distributed computing project that uses the collective power of a network of volunteers’ computers to test the accuracy of climate models. “Climate models have uncertainty in them,” said Hiro Yamazaki, a research scientist for climateprediction.net. The observational data from Old Weather can compared to simulated climate models and ultimately fine-tune them. While understanding how weather has behaved in the past offers scientists a better understanding of how it may behave in the future, the Old Weather project is not specifically focused on understanding climate change impacts. But the data will feed into scientists’ predictions of future changes, which includes long-term climate change effects, Brohan said. The aim of the project is not to inform policy or spur action on climate change, but to improve climate prediction models, he added. “I’m expecting influence on big policy changes to come through mathematics. We use data to improve models, and models to inform policy.” Demystifying the Science Beyond transcribing massive amounts of data, the scientists behind Old Weather said they hope the project will also help demystify climate science for the public. One problem with public misconceptions about climate change is that people fail to understand what scientists are doing when they use climate models, Lintott said. “One of the things Old Weather does is to help make transparent that process….Getting involved in the process makes it less remote.” That’s one reason Brian Elliott volunteered to transcribe logs for Old Weather. A research contracts officer at Aston University in Birmingham, England, Elliott said he was drawn by the historical aspects of the project but also liked the idea of nonscientists getting involved in a scientific project. “I hope that we have all learned something new so far, and hopefully the weather data will be useful in due course,” Elliott told SolveClimate News in an e-mail. “If it opens up the world of science to a wider audience then it will have been a success.”So far, Old Weather’s hundreds of volunteers have made good headway. In the projects’ first two weeks they’ve logged data from more than 126,000 pages, completing about 10 percent of the initial project, which is expected to be finished within a year. But that could be just the beginning. There are hundreds of thousands of ships’ logs in existence from different historical periods, each waiting to be captured and added to historical weather databases.“We’re hoping this will expand backwards [in time] and go international,” Lintott said.

This enigmatic sultry period, known as the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO), marked a 400,000-year-long heat wave in the midst of a long era of global cooling.Now research published Nov. 5 in the journal Science suggests the rise in surface sea temperature occurred during a time when atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were particularly high, according to a research team from Utrecht University and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research.

    "title": "Commercial Space Tourism May Spike Black Carbon Emissions",
    "date": "2010-11-05T17:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Commercial space travel on private rocket ships took a major step toward reality on Oct. 25 with the dedication of a nearly two-mile-long runway at the Spaceport America “operating hub” north of Las Cruces, N.M. Each flight will take passengers 62.5 miles above the Earth into weightless space, remain there four or five minutes, and then return to Earth. On hand was Sir Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group; Bill Richardson, New Mexico’s governor and the former U.S. Energy secretary; and about 30 civilian “future astronauts” planning space travel via Branson’s company, Virgin Galactic. But at a time when a half-dozen U.S. companies are vying to be the first to bring tourists to space, a report to be published in November in the journal Geophysical Research Letters warns that fuel emissions from such rocket launches may pose serious consequences for the Earth’s stratosphere—causing as much as a 1-degree Centigrade rise in polar temperatures and a 5 percent to 15 percent reduction in polar ice. The study looked at the emissions that could be expected in the stratosphere from rocket engines. “What we’ve discovered from these [engineering] models is that the stratosphere is particularly sensitive to black carbon particles, commonly called ‘soot,’ from rocket engines,” explained study co-author Martin Ross, an atmosphere scientist with The Aerospace Corporation, a Los Angeles–based, federally funded research and development nonprofit organization that provides guidance and technical advice to military and civilian space operations. The scientists modeled their projections on commercial space industry estimates that predict 1,000 suborbital commercial space flights annually within 10 years. According to the study, a thousand flights per year could add as much as 600 tons of soot to the stratosphere, trapping more heat there. “Once these particles are put in the stratosphere, they stay there for years,” Ross said. The potential danger from soot, or black carbon, is the journal article’s key finding, because, as Ross explained, “The effect of the soot is about 100,000 times the effect of the carbon dioxide [emitted by rockets].” While CO2 emissions from rockets is “minuscule,” Ross said, the “radiative forcing,” or warming, that would result from the soot emitted by these commercial rockets “would be comparable to the radiative forcing from carbon dioxide from all of aviation.” If industry estimates of commercial space flights hold true, the level of soot in the atmosphere will increase tenfold, according to the study. Representatives Say Fledging Industry Is Being Responsible Deron Lovaas, transportation policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said these findings are of note because of the “black carbon effect at the suborbital level. That’s a big concern.” Lovaas said that before the study came out he likened commercial space travel to a Bentley sports car—a plaything for the uberrich. Unlike an economy seat on a commercial airline today, at $200,000 per ticket the flights are out of reach of the vast majority of people, potentially limiting space tourism’s environmental impact. The study has made him reconsider. “I realize now that we need to take a close look and make sure the industry is developing responsibly,” he said. Industry decision-makers say they are being responsible. “Environmental impact has been part of the decision matrix that the company has considered since the beginning,” George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic, told SolveClimate News. The New Mexico–based airline plans to launch suborbital flights within three years. “The issue is one we take seriously.” Said Rick Homans, executive director of Spaceport America, where Galactic is the anchor tenant: “I think that as the industry moves forward, it wants to do this in the cleanest way possible and avoid any kind of damage to the planet.” Virgin Galactic is competing with several other companies in California and the Southwest to be the first in commercial space, including XCOR in Mojave, California; Armadillo Aerospace in Rockwall, TX; Sierra Nevada Corp. in Sparks, NV; Masten Space Systems in Mojave, CA; and SPACEX in Hawthorne, CA. There’s also a broker, Space Adventures, in Vienna, VA. Galactic deliberately chose to use hybrid rocket fuel, which combines the properties of liquid and solid rocket fuel, Whitesides said. Galactic also constructed its space vehicles from an all-carbon composite because it’s lighter and can take a smaller engine, requiring less propulsive force, and therefore less fuel. “These are choices we’ve made that have a lower environmental impact,” Whitesides said. Criticism of Study, and a Response Whitesides had two major criticisms of the study. “One of the things that’s a little disappointing is that the authors didn’t include a range of uncertainty in their model,” he said. “What’s the confidence around that number? I don’t think we know that.” “Given the lack of detailed knowledge of the microphysical rocket black carbon and an unknown growth rate of the space transport sector, we cannot place a formal uncertainty on our model,” Ross said. “There are no measurements of soot from rocket engines of any kind, whether they’re 50 years old or are going to be used 10 years from now.” Whitesides also said the amount of fuel propulsion used in the simulation is twice what Virgin Galactic would use in a typical launch. Moroever, that amount—up to 20,000 pounds per launch—is a fraction of what is employed in current global rocket launches. “The [NASA] shuttle flies five times a year, so you’re talking about five million pounds of solid propulsion being burned every year—which is roughly a thousand times one of our flights. And they’ve been doing it for 30 years. “I don’t think anyone is attributing a .4 degree change in temperature to the space shuttle program,” Whitesides said. Ross said the Space Shuttle has been the subject of a “modest amount” of scientific inquiry, which he has been involved in, since the",

But what about his Republican opponent, Marco Rubio? Before becoming a climate change denier and darling of the Tea Party movement, the up-and-coming state legislator was intent on blazing a Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger–like green trail in the Sunshine State. That’s why the environmentally informed say Rubio is the candidate who changed his stripes to be elected to Florida’s open Senate seat. “It’s purely politics,” California environmental adviser Terry Tamminen told InsideClimate News. “Rubio recognizes that if he wants to run as a Republican in a statewide race, he has to tack to the right. He is doing exactly what he feels he has to do and, frankly, probably holding his nose about it.” Of course, some observers will say Rubio’s strategic flip-flop is a masterstroke, because every public poll since August indicates he’s the front-runner. And many have consistently shown Rubio with a double-digit lead over both Crist and the Democratic challenger, four-term U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek. However, at least one just-released poll indicates Crist could be gaining significant ground on Rubio on the cusp of Election Day. (More on those numbers later.) “Crist has always been uncomfortable when having to pander to the far right of his party,” Jerry Karnas, an energy consultant in Florida, said in an interview. “It’s somewhat refreshing that Charlie can be Charlie now that he’s an independent.” Crist, Rubio Once on Environmental Rolls Before they became Senate candidates, both attorneys-cum-politicians had a pivotal year of firsts in",

    "content": "Mounting concerns over ocean acidification—a consequence of CO2 emissions—has accelerated research funding aimed at understanding the process potentially endangering marine life in ocean waters all across the earth.In early October, the National Science Foundation awarded over $24 million dollars to 22 projects through a new grant program targeted to study how ocean acidification affects marine environments. While the NSF has funded ocean acidification in the past, it is the first time the agency has created a special program aimed at the field of study.As CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increase, much of the gas is absorbed by the oceans, where it dissolves in the water. As a result, the oceans are getting more acidic over time. However, the long-term effects of the process are poorly understood. “There are serious concerns about ocean acidification, and that’s why this research is being conducted,” Phillip Taylor, Head of the Ocean Section in NSF’s Ocean Sciences Division, told SolveClimate News. “There are many who think this is going to have an impact on important animals in the sea that are instrumental in driving the productivity of ocean waters.”Ocean acidification threatens the growth of corals, clams and other organisms at the bottom of the food chain. These changes could trigger a domino effect throughout the oceanic ecosystem.The funded projects investigate a variety of topics, such as modeling the rate of future acidification, studying how organisms behave in lowered pH and looking at earth history to understand how current trends may progress.What the Science Says So FarOne recipient of the new grants was Bärbel Hönisch, a paleoceanographer and assistant professor at Columbia University. Hönisch is using boron isotopes to reconstruct how the oceans’ pH has changed with time; she hopes that past trends will shed light on the changes to come. “All of [this funding] is meant to get a better idea of what’s going to happen in the ocean—what can be expected for the ecology and economy,” she said.The pH of the modern oceans is 8.1.

    "content": "MANCHESTER, N.H.—Professor Lawrence Hamilton is not at all flabbergasted that most Americans are flunking Global Warming 101. The University of New Hampshire sociologist witnesses the disconnect daily as he attempts to make that learning curve less steep. Americans could boost their climate IQ, Hamilton suggests, if politicians would hire and value science advisers, scientists would speak out and more readily and share their data, and people would become more discriminating about their online intake. “What’s new is the Internet-fed belief that you know more than you know,” Hamilton told SolveClimate News. “People aren’t getting climate change information directly from scientists. Instead, it’s being filtered via the Internet. And these days, four or more years of vigorous and peer-reviewed research can get spun by a blogger in one day.” Hamilton traveled to Manchester, N.H., on Oct. 20 to present his study “Granite State Views of Climate Change” during a climate forum sponsored by the New Hampshire Carbon Action Alliance. The study shows that most New Hampshire residents believe their climate is changing—but there are deep partisan divisions. More on that later. “Not very many people could even give a three-sentence explanation of climate change,” Hamilton said about the general public. “They think they understand it, but if you gave them a physics quiz, they wouldn’t pass it.” Hamilton’s sentiments are echoed by a Yale University Project on Climate Change Communication study released in mid-October. In “Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change,” Anthony Leiserowitz and his fellow researchers found that although 63 percent of people believe global warming is happening, most of them can’t explain why. Gaps in knowledge and misconceptions about climate change and Earth systems mean few Americans are eligible for the honor roll. Some 52 percent of the population would get an F grade, 40 percent would earn a C or a D and a mere 8 percent would be at the top of the class with an A or B. Where New Hampshire Stands No doubt, grasping the basics of climatology is difficult, Hamilton said. The vocabulary is challenging, modeling programs are complex and ever-evolving, and data sets can easily be misinterpreted by laypeople. For instance, he added, very few people even know that two types of sea ice exist—one type melts every summer while another has endured for eons. To start gauging where New Hampshire residents stand on global warming, Hamilton collaborated with the UNH Carsey Institute to add three climate questions this year to what’s called the Granite State Poll. This statewide poll is a quarterly telephone survey of 500 randomly selected adults. Overall, results from April, July and September",

    "date": "2010-10-04T16:57:43-04:00",
    "content": "Miscanthus, a potential bioufuel crop, uses more water than corn or soybeans but is better for water quality, reported scientists from the University of Illinois. This picture of Miscanthus’ pros and cons comes during a period of increasing interest in the U.S. in the perennial grass. Originally from Asia, Miscanthus has been studied in Europe for over 20 years but only gained popularity in the U.S. in the last decade. In particular, Miscanthus giganteus (often referred to as simply “Miscanthus”) has been the focus of biofuel research. Field tests have shown that Miscanthus giganteus produces two to three times as much biomass as corn. The researchers’ findings, published in the September-October issue of the Journal of Environmental Quality, further revealed the pros and cons of Miscanthus as a biofuel. The scientists planted Miscanthus alongside corn, soybeans and switchgrass (another perennial grass) in east-central Illinois, and studied its behavior for four years. The study found that Miscanthus and switchgrass used more water early in the growing season. This is a potential advantage, since the plants can soak up extra water during spring floods, absorbing nitrates in the process, which can reduce the amount that drains into rivers and streams. Overall, it took about 870,000 gallons of water per year to grow one acre of Miscanthus, versus 760,000 gallons for corn. “How that’s going to be a disadvantage [when scaled up] will depend on how extensively [Miscanthus] gets planted,” said Gregory McIsaac, lead author of the paper and an associate professor emeritus at the University of Illinois. “If we planted Miscanthus everywhere in Illinois—just as a thought experiment—we’d probably reduce stream flow by about a third.” On a more realistic level, if Miscanthus were planted over 10% of the land surface, stream flow would only decrease by 3%. “That sounds a lot better, but there are still complications,” McIsaac explained. In late summer and early fall, when stream levels are at their lowest, Miscanthus continued to use more water than the other three crops. This means that during the months when water supply is lowest, more rain will be soaked up by plants instead of replenishing streams. It’s also a “critical period” for aquatic organisms. Scale, too, is an issue. “For biofuels to be economically feasible…you need to plant a lot of it [in one area],” said Mark David, a professor at the University of Illinois and co-author of the paper. It’s not cost-efficient to truck biofuels from faraway fields to a central processing plant. But dense plantings would exacerbate the water-consumption problem. It helps that Miscanthus will probably be planted on nonirrigated land, said McIsaac. If the Miscanthus biofuel industry ever takes off, he expects the crop to be concentrated in regions with high rainfall and relatively inexpensive land, such as the southeastern U.S. or southern Illinois. In terms of water quality, corn requires high levels of nitrate fertilizers. Nitrates not absorbed by the corn can be leached into local groundwater and washed into rivers. Excess nutrients from agrochemical fertilizers have already created a 7,000-acre “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico. Corn has a very short growing season; it’s planted in June and harvested in September. That leaves the soil bare for most of the year, further facilitating nitrate drainage into the watershed. Miscanthus, on the other hand, requires little, if any, fertilizer. It has a longer growing season, so the roots spend more time pulling out nitrates and slowing soil erosion. As a perennial, Miscanthus undergoes something called retranslocation: every fall when plant growth slows down, nitrogen moves from the Miscanthus’ leaves into the roots. When spring comes again, the nitrogen moves back into the shoots to fuel plant growth. “If we got rid of corn ethanol and used Miscanthus, that would really help reduce nitrate losses,” said David. Not Commercially Viable Yet Despite growing interest in using Miscanthus as a biofuel, so far the crop remains commercially unviable. There are scattered cases where Miscanthus is burned in power plants, but the practice isn’t cost-effective because coal is so cheap, said McIsaac. A more promising method involves converting plants into liquid fuel. In corn-based biofuels, bacteria can ferment the starch into ethanol. But Miscanthus is a cellulosic biofuel that requires extra pre-treatment: the cellulose must be broken down into simple sugars before fermentation. “The science isn’t all worked out, and (there’s) still much work to do,” said Emily Heaton, an assistant professor of agronomy at Iowa State University. Heaton was involved in an early part of the water-use research but is not a co-author of the paper. For Miscanthus to be economically feasible in the long run, the crop would need broad economic and political support. In",

    "date": "2010-09-27T13:50:39-04:00",
    "content": "The continuing battle between industry and conservationists over Canadian oil sands development is now spilling over onto hundreds of miles of scenic waterways and highways and public forests of the Pacific Northwest. Over the next year, ExxonMobil and its venture partner Imperial Oil plan to move 207 extrawide-load shipments of South Korean–made machinery through the region to reach the Kearl Oil Sands mine in Alberta, Canada. The largest of the loads is almost the size of a football field and weighs over 200 tons. Plans call for equipment to travel the Columbia and Snake rivers to the port of Lewiston, Idaho. From there, conveys will crawl over the curvy two-lane Highway 12 in Idaho, cross some 300 miles of Montana and head into Canada. But conservationists are calling for a time-out until safety and environmental impacts are properly assessed. They fear this project is just the first of many that will create a permanent industrial corridor through the U.S. to a massive energy enterprise they contend is environmentally destructive. In an “urgent” letter to six U.S. Senate and 17 House members from the region, a coalition of mostly environmental groups called on the Obama Administration to complete a full environmental analysis before allowing the shipments. “Without such assessment, Northwest people and localities are being forced to rely almost completely on Exxon for information about the project,” said the letter, representing 42 groups from Northwestern states. Officials at the Lewiston port are pushing the project as an economic boon. “I think this is a jobs issue for northcentral Idaho,” David Doeringsfeld, general manager for the port, told SolveClimate News. But conservationists say it would have the opposite effect. The highway-sized convoys will cause nighttime traffic closures on the mountain passes, choking off vital business routes, as well as emergency, scenic and recreational uses, they say. The roads are “used by people in pursuit of their lives and businesses, along nationally renowned and protected rivers, and through vital fish and wildlife habitats including for endangered species,” the groups said in the letter. A spokesperson for Calgary-based Imperial Oil said the company has addressed safety and environmental concerns. “Each one of the modules will be escorted front and rear by flag vehicles as well as highway patrol cars, which will be in radio contact if there’s an emergency situation where someone needs to get past the module,” Pius Rolheiser told SolveClimate News. On environmental concerns, Rolheiser said, “Our bottom line is to move these modules safely and efficiently with a minimum of impact on the land and people that we pass.” Doeringsfeld said there will be no ecological impact: “Unless you take a picture of this module going by, that’s the only way you’re going to even know it went through the area.” Permanent Corridor? Rolheiser said Imperial Oil wants to begin shipments late this fall and complete them in one year. “We have no plans beyond that.” But coalition members fear that plans are underway to turn the route into a permanent industrial corridor for the booming oil sands. Production in Alberta is expected to more than double over the next decade. “To us, this is obvious that this is a permanent corridor being developed here so the shipments will be happening over decades,” Pat Ford, executive director of Idaho’s Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, and signatory to the letter, told SolveClimate News. Doeringsfeld partially disputed that claim. “I don’t think there is anything long term,” he said. “Right now we are in discussions with Imperial Oil that they would be utilizing that highway system for approximately one year,” which he sees as well within their right. “It is a U.S. highway that was constructed for commerce.” However, he added, “I think that there are opportunities for future loads to be able to utilize that highway of the future.” So far, neither Montana nor Idaho have issued permits for the project. The departments of transportation in both states have carried out some level of environmental review. “In our opinion [the Montana study] is a very weak review of the impacts,” Kyla Weins, energy policy advocate for the Montana Environmental Information Center, told SolveClimate News. Among other things, she said “there wasn’t proper analysis of alternative routes that these trucks could take.” Ford said “neither of them is an EIS [environmental impact statement].” “Relying on two states to do the only reviews of this project…is an abdication by the federal government of its responsibilities,” he added. Federal Intervention Ford continued, “At the moment it’s a cat-and-mouse game in which Exxon and the two state departments of transportation are both being very quiet, and they’re holding the cards.” At both federal and state levels, the process has been “piecemealed,” the groups said in the letter. The project is still awaiting approval from the U.S. Forest Service for burial of utility lines to make way for the monster-size modules, among other permits. The road portion of the route runs through lands administered by the Clearwater and Lolo national forest services. Ford said these agencies should do a comprehensive EIS. However, so far the agencies “do not agree that they have to do that, even though they generally oppose the project,” he said. The groups also want to see an analysis of climate change impacts. “Again, no federal agency has yet agreed with us on that,” Ford said. The letter argues the corridor will boost output of oil sands crude and create more greenhouse gas pollution, canceling out nearby states’ progress to cut heat-trapping gases. “Exxon’s project raises a profound question about our autonomy as Northwest citizens. In recent years, Northwest citizens, businesses, communities, and legislatures have taken thousands of actions, large and small, to speed our transition to clean energy and reduce our carbon footprints,” the letter said. KC Golden, policy director at Climate Solutions, a Seattle environmental organization, said the project amounts to more “fossil-fuel-dependence-as-usual.” “We need more daylight on it, including an honest, thorough federal assessment of the consequences and the alternatives,” he told SolveClimate News in an email. But according to Doeringsfeld, the route could one day become a clean-energy corridor to deliver homegrown green technology “to assist in U.S. energy needs.” Future companies might use the road “not necessarily for oil field equipment headed to the crude oil sands,” he said, but “to deal with wind energy.” “Activity fosters activity,” Doeringsfeld said. “And to simply say that Highway 12 shouldn’t be considered for any oversized cargoes when it’s a U.S. highway, I think is a ridiculous assumption.” (Image: Fighting Goliath) See also: 50 Members of Congress Warn State Dept Against Rubberstamping 2,000-Mile Oil Sands Pipeline Permit for Canada-Texas Oil Sands Pipeline under Extra Scrutiny Coastal First Nations Oppose Canada Tar Sands Pipeline In Nebraska, Oil Pipeline Builder Keeping Deal for Landowners Secret Perhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.

    "date": "2010-09-15T13:15:49-04:00",
    "content": "International financial services heavyweight Deutsche Bank has taken aim at climate change skepticism in a just-released report that catalogs and counters the arguments denying man-made global warming. The report, titled Climate Change: Addressing the Major Skeptic Arguments, was commissioned by the bank and written by scientists at Columbia University’s Earth Institute. It lists 12 common claims used to argue against global warming and refutes each of them, pointing readers to corroborating sources. Its point is definitive. “The paper’s clear conclusion is that the primary claims of the skeptics do not undermine the assertion that human-made climate change is already happening and is a serious long-term threat,” wrote Mark Fulton, the bank’s head of climate change research. Deutsche Bank is one of the most deeply invested financial institutions in the world in climate change, with more than $5 billion being managed in climate-related funds. The bank’s asset managers look to put money into climate mitigation and adaptation ventures through private and public equity and infrastructure investment, and Fulton said the bank’s investors and asset managers are the primary audience for the report. Among the dozen claims that the report rebuts are some of the most common and oft-repeated skeptic assertions: that the earth is not warming; that climate researchers are engaged in a global conspiracy to perpetrate a hoax; that the earth’s climate is driven only by the sun; and that water vapor is the most prevalent greenhouse gas. “What is the state of the science? We asked Columbia, as trusted advisors, to give us a balanced answer in some detail,” Fulton said. “We are looking for financial investment opportunities around the climate change trend. The paper reassured us of our investment thesis and it should reassure our investors.” Dr. Mary-Elena Carr, the associate director of Columbia’s Climate Center and the study’s co-author, said she did not think the rebuttals in the paper would win over those who say man-made climate change is either not happening or does not require action. She hoped it would find a broader audience in those interested in sorting through the ocean of information on global warming. “Climate is confusing because no individual can experience it. It isn’t the same thing as weather,” Carr said. “The project helped me understand that your position on the issue is linked to your worldview.” While some of the arguments by deniers that keep appearing are interesting, Carr said, none of them alter the fundamental reality of the state of the atmosphere and the oceans which the body of scientific research has revealed. Climate change science—composed of theory, observation and computer modeling—is not based on the idea that the Earth is warmer than ever before, but on the fact that people are perturbing the system and those disturbances lead to uncertainties in the future climate. “What you need is a risk-analysis approach,” said Fulton, who has been involved in economic modeling since the",

    "content": "WASHINGTON—Before Massey Energy Co. CEO Don Blankenship even opened his mouth at a National Press Club luncheon last Thursday afternoon, demonstrators gathered outside the building on 14th Street started hammering on one of the kings of Big Coal.“Shame on Massey!” and then “Hey hey, ho ho, Blankenship has got to go!” the protesters chanted. They walked in circles on the steamy sidewalk in 90-plus degree temperatures just a few blocks from the White House and the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency. Their maroon signs, neatly lettered in yellow and white type, spelled out this message: “10 Years/54 Dead/Hold Massey Accountable.” When broached by a reporter, the marchers—some dressed in T-shirts, others in business suits—directed the questioner to AFL-CIO spokesman Josh Goldstein. “We couldn’t let Don Blankenship come to such a high profile venue and not let people know what’s going on in his mines,” Goldstein said about organized labor’s efforts. “He’s more concerned with his products and the productivity of his mines than he is with the health and safety of his miners.” The union members, he explained, were protesting as an act of solidarity with mine workers who couldn’t show up because they were attending a convention in Las Vegas. “Our whole point was to get this message to people going in,” Goldstein said. “We didn’t want to disrupt the event.” A half hour or so later, in the air conditioned comfort of the press club ballroom, one of the country’s most talked about and vilified chief executive officers made a case for coal by weaving together a rambling 30-minute talk about his background, the nation’s energy supply and why mountaintop removal—a type of surface mining—is necessary for the long haul. “I don’t normally give happy talks, I give factual talks,” noted the native of Mingo County, West Virginia, who speaks with the distinctive drawl of Appalachia. And facts for the avowed global warming doubter go something like this: Harvesting coal is patriotic because it provides homegrown jobs and provides energy security and independence. Energy from coal has modernized the world, contributing to human prosperity and longevity. Solar, wind and other renewable energy sources are too expensive and unreliable. And environmental and safety regulations are a headache because they drive jobs overseas and are written and enforced by people who lack deep insight about industry. He also espoused that acid rain wasn’t that big of a deal and questioned why regulators spend billions chasing relatively tiny U.S. carbon and mercury emissions when the bulk of these pollutants are belched into the air from Asia and the Third World. “The government can’t run all the businesses,” the self-described “competitionist” said, adding that regulations should be set on middle ground between China and the United States. They “need to let it thrive by, in a sense, leaving it alone.” Convoluted Certitudes Clearly, Blankenship is a man of his convictions. And those somewhat convoluted certitudes make environmental and social justice organizations grit their teeth. For instance, he asserts “you shouldn’t think of yourself as an environmentalist if you want to send jobs offshore.” He also claims that if you come to West Virginia’s Appalachian mountains in 20 to 25 years “I doubt you can find the site of a surface mine.” And he lit into Congress for attempting to curb heat-trapping gases. Ironically, Blankenship was in Washington the same day Senate Democrats admitted they are lacking the 60 votes necessary to push a wide-reaching energy and climate bill forward this summer. Pieces designed to price carbon and set a national renewable energy standard now will be delayed until autumn or beyond. “I’m hoping we can gain support for sensible behavior in Washington and everywhere else,” he said about the reason for his speech, adding that he wanted to see balance between jobs and environmental regulations. But some observers contend that he appeared at the press club to obfuscate Massey’s mine safety record. Back on April 5, 29 miners died in the Upper Branch Mine in Montcoal, making it the nation’s deadliest coal mine explosion in 40 years. He told his audience that Richmond, Va.-based Massey has reduced its accidents 90 percent during the last two decades. Blankenship criticized regulators, insisting that their orders to turn off methane-removing “scrubbers” created unsafe conditions at Upper Branch. He claimed that Massey engineers are far more technically savvy than the government inspectors who often overrule their decisions. Insouciance and Ego Critics say such comments are continued signs of Blankenship’s insouciance and outsize ego. Perhaps a man who has spent a lifetime in the black and white world of the coalfields can’t—or chooses not to—discern the nuance of gray areas. Massey is currently under a criminal investigation and Democrats in Congress are shaping legislation that would crack down on reckless mining companies by allowing stronger monitoring and criminal penalties, subpoena-empowered investigations and protections for miners who voice concerns about their working conditions. The House Committee on Education and Labor advanced the bill this week. Blankenship, who said he has lived and worked with coal miners daily for most of his six decades, grew up without indoor plumbing and labored in a coal mine to earn an accounting degree from his home state’s Marshall University in three years. He rose to his current position in November",

    "content": "A third and final independent review of the hacked emails of scientists at the UK’s premier Climatic Research Unit (CRU) declared on Wednesday that it “did not find any evidence” of improper behavior that would undermine the consensus on human-caused global warming. “On the specific allegations made against the behavior of CRU scientists, we find that their rigor and honesty as scientists are not in doubt,” the 160-page Independent Climate Change Emails Review said. However, the British panel of experts said there were signs of “unhelpfulness” in handling “legitimate” requests for data. “There has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness,” the review stated. Last December, more than 1,000 private emails by over 160 authors, some dating back 13 years, were leaked or stolen from a computer server at the University of East Anglia’s CRU and posted online. The controversy, called Climategate, stirred a global uproar. Global warming skeptics seized on the scandal to cast doubt on the climate consensus and inflame public debate weeks before the UN Copenhagen summit. They said the correspondence revealed attempts by scientists to suppress and doctor raw temperature data and computer code in an attempt to overstate their case for a warming world. This week’s review knocked down that claim, however. “Any independent researcher may freely obtain the primary [weather] station data,” it said. “It is impossible for a third party to withhold access to the data.” Scientists involved said the new study, funded by the University of East Anglia and led by Sir Muir Russell, a former senior servant and vice chancellor of Glasgow University, should put to rest many of the skeptics’ allegations. Phil Jones, head of CRU, who was linked to nearly 200 of the primary emails, said he was “extremely relieved” with the study. “We have maintained all along that our science is honest and sound and this has been vindicated now by three different independent external bodies,” Jones said. Third Time’s a Charm? The report marks the third and final inquiry into the cache of hacked material. The first was released in March by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee. The second, completed in April, was conducted by a group of independent researchers recommended by the Royal Society, a national science academy in Britain, and led by Ron Oxburgh, a former geologist and Shell chair. All three audits have exonerated the British and American researchers involved of any willful impropriety. But none carry more weight than the so-called Russell Review. Russell and his four-member team, who boast “100 years’ collective expertise of scientific research,” were asked by the University of East Anglia on December 3, to examine the conduct of CRU researchers and inspect allegations of data manipulation. CRU uses temperature data recorded at 4,000 of the world’s 7,000 land-based weather stations worldwide, the study said. One of the main complaints thrown up by skeptics is that CRU withheld that data and the computer code needed to reproduce the numbers. But the review said the data is “freely” available to independent researchers. Further, “the computer code required to read and analyze the instrumental temperature data is straightforward to write based upon the published literature.” “We conclude that the argument that CRU had something to hide does not stand up,” Russell told reporters on Wednesday. Not unlike the two other inquiries, the quality of climate science itself was not under scrutiny. Not Guilty, But Not Scot-Free The CRU, established in",

The summer solstice is like a giant celestial metronome, marking the arrival of the season and the passage of years with precise regularity. Humankind has celebrated and built monuments to this day across the globe and since time immemorial, from the Neolithic culture at Stonehenge, to the Mayans at Chichen Itza. The solstice always keeps a steady beat; but lately, the rhythm of summer has been increasingly out of sync. As the climate has warmed over recent decades, high temperatures have arrived earlier on average, and a symphony of seasonal events along with them, from plant blooming dates to animal migrations to peak flow levels in snow-fed streams. Nowhere is this quickening more evident than in the Arctic — the fastest-warming region on the planet.

    "content": "When Senator Lisa Murkowski, the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, started speaking today at yet another Congressional hearing on the Gulf oil spill, it was anything but business-as-usual. Her words got drowned out by a piece of political theater, courtesy of a Texas shrimper and long-time activist. The packed hearing room watched as Diane Wilson stood up and started pouring oil from a jar on herself. She wanted to protest the Alaska Senator’s efforts to block legislation that would lift the cap on liability payments for oil spills in the Gulf, and Murkowski’s resolution, up for a vote tomorrow, aimed at stopping EPA from regulating greenhouse gases through the Clean Air Act. “The police grabbed her right away and took her away,” Medea Benjamin of activist group CODEPINK, who was in the hearing room, told SolveClimate. She was supporting the action, holding up a sign that read “Murkowski = Big Oil.” Guards told Benjamin she could stay in the hearing room if she put away her sign, as the spill was cleaned up and order restored. It turned out that the substance in the jar was not oil at all, but carob syrup. “Diane didn’t want to be like BP and really spill oil,” Benjamin said, explaining that Wilson was out to provide lawmakers with a visceral experience of what it’s like to have oil dumped on you. Reached by telephone, Robert Dillon, a spokesperson for the Senator, said they have her position on oil industry liability for the oil spill wrong. “Senator Murkowski is in favor of raising the cap for oil spill liability,” he said. “What she’s against is the political gamesmanship to raise the cap to $10 billion without proper review. She will have a bill ready later this week, and it’s incorrect to characterize her as a friend of Big Oil.” According to the Sunlight Foundation, Murkowski received more than $225,000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industries between",

    "content": "From the editors of the Earth Island Journal The fish, famously, doesn’t know it’s in water. Our relationship to petroleum is much the same. From our waking moments we are surrounded by oil: It helps grow the grains in our breakfast cereal, takes us to and from work, forms the plastics that wrap our products, and then delivers those very same items to us. Oil has become the sine qua non of our lives. And for that reason it’s so easy to forget that’s it’s even there. Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky wants to remind us. Burtynsky has spent most of his career focusing on the landscapes of manufacturing complexes, creating formal compositions of industrial scenery that are at once attractive and abhorrent. His latest project is titled, simply, Oil. Ten years in the making, the collection is the result of Burtynsky’s travels throughout the globe to examine oil fields, refineries, car culture, and the eventual disposal of our oil-thirsty machines. The photos take us to places we’ve never seen and in the process reveal the massive, complicated apparatus that undergirds our lives of seamless convenience. Oil, which toured North America and Europe last year, is divided into three categories. “Extraction & Refinement” examines the landscapes that have been formed (or deformed) by the petroleum industry. An image of oil pipelines snaking through the Canadian forest is unsettling. The stark contrast between the silver of the pipes and the trees’ green shows how alien our technologies can appear on our own planet. The next section, “Transportation & Motor Culture,” then pivots to look at the built environments that, however artificial, have become our homes. Perhaps the best in this series is Burtynsky’s shot of Breezewood, PA, a town that could, with its riot of corporate logos, be Anywhere, USA. The image is incontrovertible proof of how we’ve remodeled much of our world – not to serve real people, but to accommodate the needs of our cars, which have become like second skins. Burtynsky concludes with “The End of Oil.” Where do our machines go once we no longer need them? Burtynsky’s tour of scrap heaps and junkyards feels prophetic: The piles of old tires, auto parts, and out-of-date cars and airplanes will only grow with time, the rusting Golgotha of a spent civilization. All of these scenes are, as the photographer has said, “places outside our normal experience.” Yet they are essential to our daily existence. In viewing them, we remember that we swim in a world of oil. Edward Burtynsky’s photographs have been shown at museums and galleries throughout the world. A large format book based on his Oil exhibition has recently been published by Steidl and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.

    "content": "The fatal disasters at the Upper Big Branch Mine and Deepwater Horizon are fresh evidence the Bush-Cheney corporate culture continues in some federal agencies charged with overseeing industry. President Obama needs to change that culture fast. Formal investigations are underway, but it appears that lax federal oversight and enforcement, combined with corporate corner-cutting and greed, are implicated in both of the energy industry tragedies — the worst coal mine disaster in 40 years and the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Massey Energy’s mine and BP’s drilling ship in the Gulf were subject to federal oversight. In both cases, oversight failed. Some barriers to federal oversight are systemic. Congressional hearings after the Massey disaster, for example, found that mining companies often abuse the appeals process when federal inspectors find safety violations. About 16,000 violations currently are being appealed, representing $195 million in unpaid fines. It takes more than a year to resolve an appeal these days. Other barriers are cultural, the result of an administration’s philosophy about overseeing powerful industries. During the eight years of the Bush administration, corporate lobbyists for the fossil energy industry were appointed to key government policy and regulatory jobs. The most infamous was Philip Cooney, the former lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute who used his position in the White House to censor and water down the conclusions of research by federal climate scientists. After a whistleblower revealed Cooney’s misdeeds to the New York Times, Cooney resigned and went to work for ExxonMobil. To illustrate how much the Bush administration was in bed with oil companies, however, nothing topped the scandal in the Interior Department’s Minerals Management Service, the same agency accused now of insufficient oversight in the Gulf oil spill.

    "date": "2010-05-12T11:58:30-04:00",
    "content": "The flow of 5,000 barrels of oil every day continues unabated beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and on Capitol Hill executives from the three responsible companies appeared preoccupied with shifting the blame between each other. Two Senate hearings on Tuesday featured testimony from executives from well owner BP, rig operator Transocean and Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well from which the oil continues to spew. None are yet able to offer specifics on what caused the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig and ensuing oil leak, but each are keen to lay blame on the others. Lamar McKay, Chairman and President of BP American noted that it is Transocean’s rig whose blowout preventer failed to stop the surge of gas that triggered the explosion. Steven Newman, the President and CEO of Transocean, stressed that the cementing around the well deep under water appears to have failed, highlighting Halliburton’s role in the disaster. Tim Probert, President and chief health, safety and environmental officer of Halliburton, said the cementing of the well was largely completed and had been completed according to the instructions of the well owners. The Senators involved in the hearings, meanwhile, were not impressed with the shifting of liability. \"I hear one message, and the message is: ‘Don’t blame me,’\" said Sen. John Barrasso (R—Wyo.). \"Well, shifting this blame does not get us very far.\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R—Alaska), the ranking Republican member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, echoed that sentiment. \"I would suggest to all three of you that we are all in this together, because this incident will have impact on the development of our energy policy for this country,\" she told the executives. \"And if we can’t continue to operate and convince people that we can perform safely, then not only will BP not be out there, but the Transoceans won’t be out there to drill the rigs and the Halliburton’s won’t be there to provide the cementing.\" What caused the blowout? The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee heard testimony from F. E. Beck, an associate professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University. He noted that the cementing of a well can fail relatively easily, and that repairs to the cement are not uncommon. The key, in those situations, is that other barriers—such as the mechanical barrier, the blowout preventer—do not also fail. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon, multiple lines of protection all appeared to fail almost simultaneously. \"For a blowout to occur, multiple barriers must fail, be removed or rendered useless through human error,\" Beck said. He added, though, that the blowout preventer is designed to cut off flow from certain types of pipe, and if the casing below it was faulty or different from what it was intended for, \"the blowout preventer couldn’t actually do what it was supposed to.\" MMS under fire Aside from the technical details of the disaster’s origins, there is now increased scrutiny on the government’s regulatory body that oversees offshore drilling, the Minerals Management Service, which is part of the Department of the Interior. Anticipating criticism, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar proposed splitting the agency in two—one arm will focus on regulation, inspection of rigs and safety while the other would stick to leasing of areas for oil exploration and drilling and collecting royalties. This would no doubt be a welcome development to some. Senator Maria Cantwell (D—Wash.) said during the Energy and Natural Resources Committee Hearing that industry has \"too cozy of a relationship with MMS.\" As part of the questions surrounding the regulatory body, several Senators raised the questions of preparedness for the disaster. \"We’ve had such a good success record in the gulf that maybe there has been some laxity or complacency or overconfidence,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R—Ala.). Some Democrats, meanwhile, did not seem convinced that any degree of preparedness would be enough. \"It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is no such thing as ‘too safe to spill,’ because we have had that experience already,\" said Sen. Robert Menendez (D—NJ). It was also pointed out that no specific research is being done on dealing with spills deep under water, and the various mitigation attempts—such as the containment dome—were not constructed or tested ahead of time. Flailing at mitigation That pattern of a lack of preparedness has apparently continued into the attempts at stemming the flow of oil. Multiple efforts have either been attempted or are currently underway, including drilling a relief well which will not be ready for up to three months and lowering a containment dome over the leak. The latter effort was thwarted by a buildup of methane ice crystals inside the dome, a difficulty related to a lack of experience with the method in waters so deep. \"You seem to be jumping from action to action, which we all hope and pray can work, but that doesn’t give me a sense of a plan that was ready to implemented in a worst case scenario,\" Sen. Menendez said to the company executives. \"I get the sense that you’re making things up as you go along.\" Finally, although there is no way of knowing just how extensive the damage to coastlines, communities and fisheries will end up being, some in Congress are already worried that BP will attempt to shirk responsibility with regards to what will undoubtedly be a massive cleanup bill. Under previous legislation, a cap of $75 million on damages had been placed on oil spill cleanup. McKay, of BP, repeated more than a dozen times during the day that the company would \"pay all legitimate claims\" related to the disaster. In spite of repeated questioning on what precisely \"legitimate\" means or what types of claims will be honored, McKay refused to elaborate. Although he would not say if a proposed $10 billion cap is too much, McKay did note that the $75 million cap will not apply. He said the company is already paying out claims to fishermen and others who are unable to work right now as a result of the spreading oil spill. One disaster, many drilling opinions Although all the Senators involved in the hearings reiterated the tragic nature of the event from both a human and environmental perspective, the broad responses in terms of the nation’s pursuit of oil differed wildly. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D—La.) insisted on the need to drill safely, but that offshore drilling is still a crucial part of the country’s energy policy. She also noted that the amount of oil spilled since deepwater drilling began is equal to only a tiny fraction of a percent of the amount produced. As Senator Mark Udall (D—Colo.) noted, though, \"accidents, though they can be few and far between, that doesn’t make them any less tragic.\" The long-awaited Senate climate and energy bill is set to be unveiled on Wednesday, and reports surfaced Tuesday that in the wake of the Gulf oil spill it will contain provisions allowing neighboring states to veto offshore oil drilling. Environmentalists have seized on the catastrophe as a clear example of the need to stop expansion of offshore drilling, and Sen. Cantwell summed up that prevailing attitude: \"I think it is time for us to diversify off of oil.\" See also: Oil Spill Officials Try to Blunt Fears of All-Out Ecological Disaster Gulf Oil Spill Spawns Biofuels Industry Opportunism Will the Oil Reach Washington?

    "content": "By Tim Webb, Guardian The oil industry will have to overhaul how it operates in deep water as a result of the Gulf of Mexico disaster, BP’s chief executive, Tony Hayward, said last night, as the company disclosed that the cost of the spill had now reached $350m (£236m). He said there would be \"significant implications\" in terms of new regulations and safety, while companies drilling offshore may be required in future to have spill-response equipment on standby. The blowout preventer, which failed to stem the flow of oil when the wellhead erupted and is widely used throughout the industry, is likely to be declared not fit for purpose, he added. Hayward admitted BP was having to learn on the job how to contain the spill as this kind of accident had never happened before at such depths. \"There is an enormous amount of learning going on. We are doing it for real for the first time,\" he told reporters on a conference call last night. He also acknowledged that BP did not know how much oil was leaking from the stricken pipeline, which now lies 1.5km under the sea after the rig operating it exploded and sank three weeks ago. Kent Wells, senior vice-president in BP’s exploration and production business, said: \"There is no way to measure it [the flow].\" A BP spokesman stressed the estimate of 5,000 barrels a day leaking from the well came from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. US regulators and government agencies are still investigating what caused the well head to blow, leading to the disaster in which 11 rig workers died. Hayward said: \"Implications for the industry will only become clear once the results of the investigation become known.\" But he added: \"There will be significant implications for regulations, on the redundancy of blowout preventers, and safety. There will be some significant findings on subsea intervention [how leaks are tackled] – what might industry have to have available [in case any accident happened].\" The cost of dealing with the disaster includes the flotilla of 275 skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels being used to collect and disperse the slick, as well as the efforts to stem the spill on the sea bed. The clean-up has cost about $150m so far and has escalated significantly as the scale of the environmental disaster has unfolded. A few days after the Deepwater Horizon exploded, BP said about $1m a day was being spent on the relief effort. Last week, this rose to $6m a day, and now stands at approximately $10m. Drilling several relief wells will also cost a further $100m. Another $100m has been spent distributing grants to the four US states affected by the slick – Louisiana, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Unspecified amounts have also been paid to the National Guard and in federal costs. BP said it was also planning to use \"top kill\" to try to stem the flow of oil from the well head. This involves blasting a mixture of debris such as rubber tyres and golf balls into the blowout preventer, which would then be sealed using cement. A spokesman for the company said it could take several weeks to prepare. The company is also planning to lower a second, much smaller canopy on to one of the two remaining leaks on the pipe, which is now lying on the seabed.

    "date": "2010-05-04T16:41:26-04:00",
    "content": "Among the reasons why halting the forward march of global warming is so difficult is that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for around 100 years, so that any emissions cuts made by the world will take time to have an effect. At least one other climate change villain, though, is short lived, offering potentially fast help in slowing ice melt and warming: black carbon, or soot. In recent years, enthusiasm for lowering global emissions of black carbon has increased. But new research published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters suggests that black carbon’s contribution in the climate system is not so straightforward as once thought. While there is little doubt that the fine black particles released from diesel and biomass cook stoves warm the planet by sitting in the atmosphere and absorbing energy, they also affect cloud formatioin in ways that can create a cooling mechanism, the study says. \"If we controlled black carbon, potentially the magnitude of the reduced cloud reflectivity and amount of cloud coverage could counteract the beneficial cooling,\" said Wei-Ting Chen, of the California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and lead author of the new study. \"When people talk about policies of mitigating black carbon, they should consider the combined effects of both the heating reduction and the indirect cloud response.\" Combining the two effects in a scenario where the world manages to cut black carbon emissions by half could actually result in a very slight increase in warming, rather than the opposite as is usually thought, according to the paper. Chen was quick to point out, though, that their analysis has its limits, including a lack of inclusion of black carbon’s effects on surface albedo, or reflectivity. \"Our point is that black carbon is not as simple as people think,\" she said. \"It is not just heating the atmosphere.\" Reason to Hold Back? If black carbon is not a straightforward warming culprit, as the authors suggest, should efforts to stem its emission be scaled back or rethought? \"Someone somewhere will probably use this paper as a reason to not tackle black carbon,\" said John-Michael Cross, a research associated at the Climate Institute. Even if soot’s interaction with the climate is more complicated than we thought, there is plenty of reason still to try and reduce emissions. First of all, the lack of accounting for surface albedo makes holding back a difficult argument to make. \"Black carbon landing on snow and ice is not a huge global forcing change, but it is fairly significant in those regions, and regions we’re concerned about like the Arctic and the Himalayas,\" Cross said. Chen, who added that the cloud effects of black carbon should simply be considered in doing future modeling, agreed. \"If we focus on regional climate change, in the polar regions this would be a more important effect than the others for black carbon,\" Chen said. Human Health Issues Perhaps even more important, black carbon has long been known to cause significant human health problems. Indoor pollution, mostly from cooking fires in developing countries, causes as many as 1.8 million deaths each year; more than two billion people still use relatively primitive stoves to cook food. There are efforts to replace old stoves with newer, cleaner ones, though Cross said some of these efforts have faced difficulties. \"A lot of these villages, they use traditional cooking methods that have been around for generations,\" Cross told SolveClimate. \"And it’s not one size fits all, because different cultures have different cooking methods and different cooking needs. You can’t just make one new stove.\" The other major source of black carbon emissions is diesel-burning engines, which in the U.S. and Europe have already seen substantial improvements in their emissions. Several initiatives including the Diesel Engine Reduction Act of",

    "content": "By John Crace, Guardian Around 10 p.m. on Tuesday, April 20, an explosion ripped through the Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, 50 miles off the Louisiana coast. Jed Kersey’s son, John, had just finished his shift and was asleep when the alarm sounded and the electricity went off. He raced upstairs and made it to a lifeboat. \"He said it was like a war zone,\" his father said later. \"They waited for as many people as they could …\" Eleven people, all of whom were working on the \"rig floor\", the relatively small area where drilling operations are actually conducted, died in the blast; a further 17 were injured, two critically. The remainder of the 126-strong crew were safely airlifted back to the U.S. mainland. It could have been worse, though. Coast Guard Petty Officer Kevin Fernandez was on board the first rescue helicopter, reaching the scene 15 minutes after the explosion. Flames were rising 500 feet into the air from the \"semi-submersible\" rig — the visible portion of which sits above vast underwater pontoons. \"I was kind of expecting more fatalities,\" he said. Two days later, the rig sank, with oil spilling out into the sea. It still is, around 5,000 barrels a day, as efforts to stem the flow from the seabed with robot submarines have so far proved unsuccessful, and the clean-up operation has barely got beyond the first test-burn to try and ignite some of the surface oil. The extent of the environmental impact is expected to be severe, with a state of emergency having been declared last night in Louisiana. Precise information on what went wrong is hard to come by. There is some confusion about exact timings. One Coast Guard reported an explosion on the rig three hours before the one that started the fatal fire. Coast Guard Senior Chief Petty Officer Mike O’Berry told a local news agency that according to their internal reports, the first blast was reported at 7 p.m., but the rig did not sound the alarm for help. At present it is unclear if the two incidents are related, but preliminary investigations suggest the second was an old-fashioned blowout, caused by an uncontrolled release of gas or oil forcing its way up the well pipe and setting fire to the operating and living quarters on the platform above the sea. This is not as rare as you might think. At the time of the incident, rig workers were cementing the wellhead, the component used to control the pressure flow to the surface, to the ocean floor — an operation frequently linked to blowouts in the past. The U.S. Minerals Management Services (MMS) has been concerned about the practice of cementing for some time; its",

    "date": "2010-04-14T11:36:28-04:00",
    "content": "The scientists at the center of the row over the hacked climate emails have been cleared of any deliberate malpractice by the second of three inquiries into their conduct. The inquiry panel, led by the former chair of the House of Lords science and technology select committee Lord Oxburgh, was commissioned by the University of East Anglia with investigating the research produced by the scientists at its Climatic Research Unit (CRU). The work of the unit has come under intense scrutiny since November when thousands of private emails between the researchers were released onto the Internet. At a press conference today Lord Oxburgh said, “Whatever was said in the emails, the basic science seems to have been done fairly and properly,” although his panel did criticize the scientists for not using the best statistical techniques at times. The report concluded: “We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely that we would have detected it. “Rather we found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganized researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of public attention. As with many small research groups, their internal procedures were rather informal.” In a formal response to the report the UEA wrote: “It is gratifying to us that the Oxburgh report points out that CRU has done a public service of great value by carrying out meticulous work on temperature records when it was unfashionable and attracted little scientific interest, and that the unit has been among the leaders in international efforts to determine the overall uncertainty in the derived temperature records.” The panel was not tasked specifically with looking at the way CRU handled access to its data and Freedom of Information requests from members of the public, but it commented that there were “a host of important unresolved questions” arising from the application of FoI to academic research. “We agree with the CRU view that the authority for releasing unpublished raw data to third parties should stay with those who collected it,” the report said. It did criticize the government’s policy of charging for access to data. “This is unfortunate and seems inconsistent with policies of open access to data promoted elsewhere in government.” The panel did raise doubts about the statistical input into scientific papers authored by researchers at CRU. “We cannot help remarking that it is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians,” it concluded. In UEA’s formal response it noted: “Specialists in many areas of research acquire and develop the statistical skills pertinent to their own particular data analysis requirements. However, we do see the sense in engaging more fully with the wider statistics community to ensure that the most effective and up-to-date statistical techniques are adopted and will now consider further how best to achieve this.” The University of East Anglia set up and funded the review in March. The appointment of Oxburgh, who is a former industry scientist and academic has been criticized by some who are suspicious of CRU’s work. He is currently president of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association and has business interests in wind energy so critics have alleged that he has a vested interested in defending the science of climate change. Oxburgh denies that the review panel had a pre-conceived opinion about the science. His is the second of three inquiries into the release of private emails from researchers at UEA. The first inquiry, by the House of Commons Science and Technology select committee, criticized UEA for not tackling a “culture of withholding information” among the scientists, but it did not blame CRU or professor Phil Jones for these failings, and it concluded that his scientific reputation was untarnished. The third inquiry into the hacked emails, headed by Sir Muir Russel, who was appointed by UEA in December to look at four key allegations arising from the correspondence, is due to report shortly. The members of Oxburgh’s panel were: professors Huw Davies of ETH Zurich, Kerry Emanual of MIT, Lisa Graumlich of the University of Arizona, David Hand of Imperial College London, and Herbert Huppert and Michael Kelly of the University of Cambridge.

    "date": "2010-03-23T20:33:56-04:00",
    "content": "The White House’s elation over the passage of health care reform won’t erase the facts that not a single Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives voted for the bill and that the insurance industry provided massive opposition after failing to get all it wanted during negotiations. These facts should be remembered as the focus on Capitol Hill shifts toward another of President Obama’s goals: a comprehensive climate and energy bill. The immediate reactions to the health care vote’s effect on this next legislative battle have been strikingly mixed. Some argue no one on the Hill will have the stomach for another protracted and bitterly partisan battle, while others insist that the president and his allies appear to be hitting their stride and will ride that momentum toward climate legislation. There is some trepidation coming from the White House itself, with presidential advisor David Axelrod saying that “there is no doubt that [the president] has pushed a lot of his political chips in the middle of the table.” Either way, there is an interesting parallel between the two political struggles: Just as the insurance companies — and to a lesser extent, the pharmaceutical industry — were powerfully positioned to first influence the writing of the legislation and then to attempt to block health care reform, the coal industry and other polluters are in the same spot when it comes to a climate and energy bill. There does appear to be a major difference in the two opponent industries in each of these fights, though: The coal lobby is better positioned, with the influence it can wield directly in key electoral geographies. “I think the coal lobby has done a bang-up job of aggressively fighting against these bills, forcing the Democrats to weaken them,” said Kieran Suckling, founder and executive director of the non-profit Center for Biological Diversity. Messaging Success The best evidence of their success is that from the White House to Congress, the coal industry is being supported toward a future of further growth and profitability. For almost as long as President Obama has been speaking about the need for energy reform and climate change mitigation, he has included the term “clean coal” in his speeches. Sometimes he gets more specific and touts carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). And this isn’t just the president. There have been generous provisions for CCS research and deployment in every major piece of proposed climate legislation, from the Waxman-Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES) that narrowly passed the House last year to the framework of the upcoming Kerry-Graham-Lieberman Senate bill. At the same time, policymakers on both sides of the aisle are fighting to restrict the EPA’s ability to use the Clean Air Act to regulate CO2 emissions from coal-burning utilities. “We have seen every successive climate bill get weaker and weaker,” Suckling said. “And the initial descriptions now that we’re getting of the Kerry-Lieberman-Graham bill is hitting a new low, and we believe it is completely unacceptable. It has become a race to the bottom.” The political focus on coal comes amid a sea of policy experts, scientists and environmentalists pointing out that commercial-scale CCS won’t be developed enough to really help start to bring down emissions in a timely fashion; and that coal is dirty no matter how much you scrub it. The effects of mountaintop removal mining on water quality alone are enough to convince many that coal should simply be left where it lies. “We believe that there is no such thing as ‘clean coal’,” former Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope said in February. “While further research into carbon capture and sequestration technology may ultimately prove useful and economically feasible for existing facilities, we do not support building new coal plants using a costly and unproven technology that even the coal industry itself refuses to expend its own resources on to commercialize.” DOE and Non-Profit Support Still, the government is pushing forward. In only the last month, the Department of Energy has awarded several large funding packages for “demonstration projects” involving both pre- and post-combustion CCS plants — meaning, removing CO2 before burning the coal and afterwards, in the smokestack. One project by NRG Energy in Texas will receive up to $154 million from the government for a CCS plant. Some of the country’s biggest environmental groups are on board with CCS as well. The Natural Resources Defense Council takes a decidedly practical approach, supporting development of CCS while taking issue with the idea that coal could ever be “clean.” “The reality is that coal is relatively cheap and abundant, and it generates on average half of all of our electricity,” NRDC President Frances Beinecke wrote. “Coal will continue to be a part of our energy portfolio for a while. The need to reduce global warming emissions is so urgent that we cannot wait until we have political support for replacing all coal plants with renewable sources.” Another major group, the Environmental Defense Fund, also supported Waxman-Markey and its generous provisions for rapid deployment of CCS. “The big national environmental groups have put virtually no pressure to improve these [bills,]” Suckling said. “It is an unbelievably naïve strategy, and it puts big coal in the driver’s seat because big coal is the only entity demanding anything. Consequently, big coal is the only entity that gets anything.” The coal lobby also has an inherent advantage in its hard geographic placement. As opposed to the insurance industry, there are definite coal states commanding specific votes on Capitol Hill; the lobby entrenches itself both philosophically and geographically. Some environmental groups, like the Sierra Club, are fighting back. Its Beyond Coal campaign has helped shelve plans for about 100 new coal-fired power plants over the past decade, and Greenpeace is adamantly opposed to any further funding of coal-based technology. In fact, Greenpeace pulled its support for the Waxman-Markey bill based on weak emissions targets and the inclusion of subsidies for coal and oil industries. Coal Momentum In spite of some green groups’ opposition, the coal lobby has clearly done well for itself. Last year, billions of dollars were already being promised to the “clean coal” industry, and with the DOE’s recent generosity through the Clean Coal Power Initiative, that trend does not appear to be slowing. Interestingly, recent weeks have seen some industry holdouts soften toward an energy bill; even the generally anti-climate action Chamber of Commerce said last week that Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Lindsey Graham’s (R-S.C.) bill is “largely in synch” with the group’s goals. This came after a closed-door meeting with Kerry, the occurrence of which alone “is a great example of why Washington is broken,” said Steven Biel, the Clean Energy Campaign director at MoveOn.org. “Big corporations and lobbyists run the show, and the American people are locked out.” The pragmatic — and some would say cynical — view is that any bill is better than nothing, and that it is simply impossible to get a bill through that does not cater to some of coal and other industries’ wishes. Biel disagrees. “The big corporations didn’t want Barack Obama to be President; the big corporations didn’t want health care reform; the big corporations wanted Republicans to remain in control of congress,” he said. “American history has proved nothing if not that with hard work and perseverance we can defeat special interests.” See also: Obama: The Making of a Clean Coal President Clean Energy Climate Bill Gives Coal a Competitive Future Will West Virgina’s CCS Demo Make a Dent in Clean Coal’s Problems?

Construction of the plant has already begun, and contracts for key components have been signed.

There are trade-offs between increasing South Africa’s electricity generation capacity and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions (as laid out in the country’s national Long-Term Mitigation Scenarios) that must be reconciled.

Phil Jones (photo), head scientist of the premier Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, acknowledged that he refused requests for the institute’s raw climate data, but only because of confidentiality agreements with national weather stations supplying the figures. “No breach of the law has been established,” said Edward Acton, vice chancellor of university. Late last year, thousands of emails and documents, some dating back 13 years, were stolen from a University of East Anglia server and placed on the Internet. Critics say the correspondence reveals, among other things, attempts by scientists to fend off freedom of information (FOI) requests for primary temperature data and computer codes, leading to accusations that researchers violated the UK’s FOI Act. Since the scandal broke, the CRU has asked meteorological stations in 150 countries for approval to release their temperature data. So far, 59 have replied, said Jones, with 52 agreeing to public dissemination. According to Jones, whose emails have been particularly derided, 80 percent of the raw data CRU has used is now available online. He also said that almost all of the figures in question have long been accessible through two U.S. science agencies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA. Acton said the university is “longing” to publish all of the primary data it has used on the CRU web site. But “seven countries have said ‘no,'” he said, and “half the countries haven’t yet answered.” Canada, Poland and Sweden are among those nations that have declined. Russia, Acton added, is “very hesitant.” The three-hour hearing was held Monday by the UK parliamentary science and technology select committee, which has launched an inquiry into the matter. Julia Slingo, chief scientist of the Met Office, the UK’s national meteorological service, confirmed the claims by Jones and Acton. “Observations that went into the crude [temperature] data set are fundamentally owned by the national met services,” Slingo said. “Some governments see this data as having commercial value” and aren’t willing to give it up. ‘Awful Emails’ Jones, who has been accused of hiding emails and data from climate skeptics, conceded to the committee that he wrote “some awful emails.” “I fully admit that,” he said. John Beddington, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said he thinks “some of the wording [of the emails] is unfortunate, and there is cause for concern.” Benny Peiser, the director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the scandal is “tarnishing the image of British science around the world.” Analysts agree that global warming skeptics have used the controversy to try to cast doubt on widely accepted assumptions about human-caused climate change. As the reverberations continue, scientists fear the scandal could influence public opinion about the state of the science. “The media has certainly portrayed the UEA issue as a crisis, so to the public it has been portrayed as a crisis,” said Bob Watson, chief scientist for the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and former head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Climate Science Untarnished The parliamentary hearing was supposedly convened to examine the scientific integrity of the CRU methods only, not to challenge the science of global warming. But questions also emerged about the operation and legitimacy of the UN’s top climate science body, the IPCC. Slingo said the main finding of the IPCC’s",

    "content": "In his Feb. 10 article \"Obama: The Making of a Clean Coal President,\" David Sassoon wrote about the U.S. president’s creation of a task force to develop a national carbon capture and storage strategy, calling it as a victory for the coal industry and describing how the backing of green groups had helped to cement Obama’s support for CCS technology. NRDC Climate Programs Director David Hawkins wrote the following response. By David Hawkins Let me offer a few thoughts on why I believe this task force actually is a step forward for all of us who want to put an end to investments in new polluting coal plants, increase our reliance on energy efficiency and renewable energy, and prevent disastrous climate disruption. Our community uses several tactics to block new polluting coal plants. We intervene in permit proceedings and bring lawsuits to challenge coal plant permits. NRDC has actively used this tactic, joining the outstanding efforts by the Sierra Club and others. Another tactic, that NRDC also has pursued, is advocacy with Wall Street investors to convince them that investments in new polluting coal plants are a bad bet. A third is advocacy for performance standards that would make it legally impossible for new polluting coal plants to be built. NRDC worked hard to get such a law enacted in California and is seeking such standards in federal legislation. A fourth is to create a broad consensus that no new coal plant should be built unless it captures its carbon. This last approach, which NRDC has pursued as well, is controversial in our community because it does not call for an absolute bar on new coal plants regardless of environmental performance and it lends legitimacy to carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. I certainly understand the controversy — after all, if the coal industry seems to be supporting CCS, there is good reason to suspect something nefarious. And Mike Brune is right that the coal industry has a perfect record in speaking with a forked tongue on CCS — claiming that it is an essential technology, arguing that it is not ready, and then working to block any policy that would require it to be used. But the coal industry’s duplicity should not keep us from assessing for ourselves whether CCS can help us stave off climate destruction and increase our use of cleaner energy. As a community, we have achieved great success in blocking new coal plants one by one but we need a comprehensive coal policy as well. Showing CCS is an available tool helps us to convince policymakers that they should oppose construction of coal plants that do not capture their carbon. Is such a policy as attractive to many in our community as a law that says no more coal plants, period? No. But we need to ask ourselves — what are the realistic odds of getting Congress or any significant coal-using state to adopt a \"no new coal, period\" policy in the next handful of years? I have fought the coal industry for 40 years and in my judgment the odds of a total ban on new coal plants are not large. But we do have in our grasp the adoption of policies that will bar the construction of new coal plants unless the plant operates CCS. Securing the votes to get these policies enacted will require convincing some members of Congress that coal plants with CCS could in fact be built. I know that this is objectionable to many in our community but which is a better outcome: leaving the door open to building new coal plants with no CO2 controls at all or leaving it open only to coal plants with CCS? Right now, the coal industry uses the claim that CCS is not ready as a weapon to fight mandatory CO2 requirements. Those of us who talk to members of Congress know that these claims are influential in far too many offices. The Obama CCS task force is a way to take that argument away from the coal industry. Some in our community seem to fear that if we admit that CCS might become a tool in the climate protection toolbox that we will lose the battles to deploy truly clean resources like efficiency and renewables and to end atrocities like mountaintop removal (MTR). With respect, I think that view is a mistake. What CCS will do, in addition to cutting carbon pollution, is to internalize one cost of coal use that is currently ignored. That is a huge step forward in ending the distorted market that has allowed coal to dominate electricity production until now. A policy requiring new coal plants to use CCS dramatically improves the economic competitiveness of cleaner alternatives overnight. It is true that CCS will not stop MTR; neither will SO2 scrubbers, NOx controls, mercury controls, or baghouses. But that has never caused us to oppose those vital life-saving control measures in the past. To fight MTR we need to take it on directly, as many are doing brilliantly. NRDC is proud of its work to end this scourge and we won’t stop until MTR is history. As NRDC’s President Frances Beinecke makes clear in her recent blog, supporting CCS does not mean condoning the damages that coal, as it is mined and used today, inflicts on us all. CCS may also be an additional tool to cut carbon emissions from existing plants. We all want to use efficiency and renewables (and, more controversially, natural gas) to back out coal and carbon pollution from the more than 300GW of existing coal plants. But that won’t happen without strong policies. The reality is that we have not yet made the sale with critical members of Congress that a coal-free energy system is feasible in the near term. However, we can make the sale that CCS can become a real option, with a serious effort and supporting policies. Our community should not be afraid of having an additional tool to go after emissions from existing coal plants. If CCS is shown to be feasible for existing coal plants it will become harder and harder for those plants to justify operating without it. That helps level the playing field for alternatives to coal. Nor is CCS just about coal. CCS may also turn out to be something we need to get more rapid reductions in greenhouse gas pollution. We all know we should have started a serious climate protection program decades ago. Instead, our \"leaders\" have let carbon pollution build up at an accelerating rate with a lot more in the pipeline. Most of us fear that we are in for some disastrous impacts just due to what is already in the atmosphere along with the added amounts we cannot prevent in the next few decades. We may well need to pull CO2 out of the air by applying CCS to sustainably produced biomass. Using the politics of coal to prove out CCS so it is available for broader applications may be seen in a decade or so as a smart move. The energy penalty projected for first-generation CCS systems is a legitimate concern. But we need not worry about a future of massive deployment of high energy penalty CCS systems. If CCS designs do not achieve substantially better efficiencies than the first versions, other low-carbon options will win in the marketplace. What about the risk that CCS subsidies will enable coal to crowd out superior energy choices? Well, the key feature of the CCS subsidy provisions in the House and Senate climate bills is that payment is tied to actual capture and disposal of CO2. This is a huge change from past subsidies, including those in the stimulus bill, where the payment is not tied to actual tons of pollution avoided. While our community still may not like these CCS subsidies, keep in mind that they are part of a package that will put in place a steadily tightening cap on carbon pollution and a CO2 performance standard for new coal plants. That is a radically different policy environment than the status quo — one that will dramatically increase the prospects for efficiency and renewables. So whether you think, as NRDC does, that pay-for-performance CCS subsidies are an appropriate hedging strategy or that it’s just the price to pay to get the US off the dime on cutting carbon pollution, the odds are that CCS can play a positive role in helping us achieve our goals of moving the US and the world to a cleaner energy future.
