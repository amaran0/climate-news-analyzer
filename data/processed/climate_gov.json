    "content": "After just a few months of La Niña conditions, the tropical Pacific is now ENSO-neutral, and forecasters expect neutral to continue through the Northern Hemisphere summer. El Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool phases of a natural climate pattern across the tropical Pacific known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or “ENSO” for short. The pattern shifts back and forth irregularly every two to seven years, bringing predictable changes in ocean temperature and disrupting the normal wind and rainfall patterns across the tropics. These changes in the seasonal climate of the world's biggest ocean have a cascade of global side effects. La Niña has ended, and the tropical Pacific is now in a neutral state—neither La Niña nor El Niño. Without those strong patterns influencing the atmosphere, it’s harder to anticipate seasonal shifts in rain, storms, or temperatures. Neutral likely lasts through fall. More U.S. impacts ENSO conditions can affect the climate over sizable portions of the globe, including regions far removed from the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño and La Niña have weaker impacts during Northern Hemisphere summer than they do in winter. On the second Thursday of each month, scientists with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in collaboration with forecasters at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) release an official update on the status of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

In a rather gutsy (some would argue delusional) move, they turned over the keys to a team of climate scientists–actual nerds!–to discuss the current El Niño Watch and offer perspectives and analysis on the progression of El Niño and related topics. Here is our team... … with additional support from the Climate.gov team and especially the News & Features managing editor, Rebecca Lindsey, who will ensure that we write in complete sentences and not entirely in mathematical equations. We plan to define terms and provide supporting material, but apologies in advance when we mess up. Remember, we are nerds. We will pay attention to your comments, so don’t be afraid to ask us “what is a Kelvin wave?” We will either try to address it in a future blog post or directly in the comments section. We are new to the blogging world, but we hope to draw inspiration from the weather and climate blogs that have come before us, such as Capital Weather Gang and Jeff Master’s WunderBlog, but from the perspective of operational climate scientists. We hope this will be both a fun and informative experience for our readers, and we recognize we will not succeed without you, so please give us your constructive feedback and offer suggestions. While we remain editors, we will rely on other contributors, who will weigh in with their own perspectives and research not only specific to ENSO, but on related topics such as associated societal impacts.

After glancing at the stereotypical scientist, you might immediately assume “En-so” is a Star Wars character, but you would be mistaken. ENSO is one of the most important climate phenomena on Earth due to its ability to change the global atmospheric circulation, which in turn, influences temperature and precipitation across the globe. We also focus on ENSO because we can often predict its arrival many seasons in advance of its strongest impacts on weather and climate. Though ENSO is a single climate phenomenon, it has three states, or phases, it can be in. The two opposite phases, “El Niño” and “La Niña,” require certain changes in both the ocean and the atmosphere because ENSO is a coupled climate phenomenon. “Neutral” is in the middle of the continuum.

    "date": null,
    "content": "ENSO arises from changes across the tropical Pacific Ocean. So why does ENSO affect the climate over sizable portions of the globe, including some regions far removed from the tropical Pacific Ocean? Does the strength of ENSO matter for global impacts? ENSO affects the sea surface temperature (SST) in regions where fishing is a major industry to some countries. A prominent example is the anchovy fishing routinely done off the northwest coast of Peru. When El Niño occurs, the warmed waters become unfavorable for the fish, which flee for cooler waters, resulting in poor harvests that are detrimental to the Peruvian economy. But the abnormal tropical Pacfic SSTs are only the beginning of the story of ENSO’s impacts. When El Niño occurs, the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean becomes warmer than average. With the elevated SST, there is more thunderstorm activity, or convection, than usual over the waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. This convection is caused by the increased temperature and moisture in the air right above the warmed water. This warm, moist air rises to form thunderstorm clouds. The process causes latent heating in the upper atmosphere: heat from the warmed surface of the ocean is released when water vapor condenses into clouds and rainfall. With more storminess than usual, the upper atmosphere becomes warmer than usual, and this extra heat sets in motion yet another series of important effects. The rising air in the tropical Pacific can branch away from the equator toward the higher latitudes, both northward and southward, contributing to the complex circulation patterns that help establish the average worldwide climate features. This poleward movement of air in the upper atmosphere, sinking motion over the subtropics, and the return flow at lower levels of the atmosphere toward the lower pressure at the equator, is called the Hadley circulation (see figure). El Niño influences global atmospheric circulation by intensifying the Hadley circulation, in which heat is transferred from the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere through convection and latent heating. Map by . When an El Niño causes excess heating in the tropical Pacific upper atmosphere, the air flow toward the poles becomes more vigorous. The change in the strength of the Hadley circulation leads to modifications in the circulation patterns worldwide, including, for example, the position of the jet stream that flows from west to east over the North Pacific in winter months. El Niño tends to lead to an elongated jet stream that can extend all the way to North America and bring an above-average supply of storms across the southern part of the United States. By strengthening the Hadley circulation, El Niño can trigger a cascade of noticeable departures from the normal rainfall patterns around the globe. The changes in the atmospheric circulation, and subsequent ground-level climate impacts, that stretch across the globe are called El Niño teleconnections (see figure). Teleconnection patterns emerge in climate simulations, and they show up in historical observations. Typical rainfall patterns during El Niño events. Such teleconnections are likely during El Niño events, but not certain. Map by IRI. Observations since",

    "content": "Many people are interested in knowing which ENSO category (La Niña, neutral or El Niño) is expected by the climate experts, just as they might want to know the weather forecast for tomorrow. They usually prefer a simple answer—one with little or no uncertainty. Unfortunately, however, weather and climate forecasts are never about certainty: they’re about probability. Using probabilities allows us to describe the uncertainty in quantitative terms. If there were no uncertainty about what the climate would be like in the future, then one outcome would be given a 100% chance of occurring, while any other outcome(s) would have a 0% chance. While probabilities near 0% and 100% often occur in astronomy and solid state physics problems, they are virtually nonexistent in weather and climate forecasting, due to the fluid and chaotic nature of the ocean and the atmosphere.

    "content": "The Signal and the Noise is often mentioned in reference to ENSO forecasting and not just in reference to Nate Silver’s bestselling book. In fact, understanding what is signal and what is noise is critical to interpreting predictions from models and climate science in general. Very generally: (1) Signal: Signal is the part of the forecast that can be predicted if one were to build a perfect climate model (for example, physical relationships between and within the ocean and atmosphere are perfectly understood and coded into the model). In seasonal climate prediction, signal can arise from the surface conditions, such as sea surface temperatures, land cover, or sea ice, which vary more slowly than faster atmospheric motions. (2) Noise: Noise is the part of the forecast that cannot be predicted. Despite having a perfect model and understanding of the physical system, there will always be some uncertainty associated with the forecast because imprecise observations made at the time of the forecast (also known as errors in initial conditions) will grow into the future. Think of the noise as akin to the famous “butterfly flaps its wings” example – a butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil and the ripple effect contributes to a tornado in Texas (Lorenz,",

Ok, they probably only think of #2, but we here at the ENSO blog are trying to broaden that viewpoint. We’ve already discussed US impacts during El Niño but we know it also affects global circulation. One of ENSO’s most important influences is to the Indian Monsoon—the large-scale circulation pattern that brings the Indian subcontinent the vast majority of its yearly rainfall. From June through September, India and its population of 1.2 billion receive most of their annual rainfall. To put this into perspective, imagine receiving all the money you can spend during a month during the first week. Usually, you have enough to get by, sometimes you are in for a cash windfall, but other times you have to stretch every penny. You can imagine the importance of knowing just how much money you may get ahead of time, so you can plan ahead. In other words, an accurate forecast is essential. Every year the responsibility for forecasting the arrival and strength of the Indian Monsoon falls to the India Meteorological Department.

    "content": "Forecasters at the Climate Prediction Center haven’t declared El Niño conditions, even though the Niño3.4 index is currently around 0.5°C above normal, and has been for the past two months. What’s the hold up? In short, we’re waiting for the atmosphere to respond to the warmer sea-surface temperatures, and give us the “SO” part of ENSO. SO what? The Southern Oscillation, that’s what. The Southern Oscillation is a seesaw in surface pressure between a large area surrounding Indonesia and another in the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific; it’s the atmospheric half of El Niño. Since ENSO is a coupled system, meaning the atmosphere and ocean influence each other, both need to meet the criteria for El Niño before we declare El Niño conditions. During average (non-El Niño) times, the waters of the western tropical Pacific are much warmer than in the east/central area (Figure 1). As warmer water extends out to the east during an El Niño, it warms the air, causing it to rise (lower pressure) (Figure 2). In turn, there is less rising motion (higher pressure) near Indonesia, due to the relatively cooler waters and overlying air. Figure 1. Average state of ocean temperatures, rainfall, pressure, and winds over the Pacific during ENSO-neutral conditions. Figure 2. Generalized state of the ocean and atmosphere during El Niño conditions. NOAA image created by David Stroud. The pressure changes influence the wind patterns. The average (non-El Niño) state of the atmosphere over the tropical Pacific features convection and rainfall over Indonesia, low-level easterly winds (the trade winds that blow from east to west), and upper-level westerly winds (Figure 1). These are the basic components of the Pacific Walker Circulation. During El Niño, the system shifts: we see weaker trade winds over the Pacific, less rain than usual over Indonesia, and more rain than usual over the central or eastern Pacific. During some El Niño events, the trade winds along the equator even reverse, and we see low-level westerlies… but not every time. In fact, every El Niño is different, and both the ocean and atmospheric characteristics vary quite a lot from event to event–but that’s a topic for another post! This difference from average air pressure patterns across the Pacific is measured a few different ways. One is the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which is based on a long record of pressure measured by two stations: one in Darwin, Australia (south of Indonesia) and the other in Tahiti (east-central tropical Pacific) (Figure 3). A negative SOI indicates Darwin’s pressure is higher than average and Tahiti’s is lower than average: El Niño conditions. (I keep saying “higher than average” because we’re not just comparing Darwin’s pressure to Tahiti’s, but rather comparing the anomalies at each. Imagine comparing the price of a gallon of water to that of a gallon of gas. A negative index is if the price of the water goes up, and the gas goes on sale. The gas may still cost more than the water, but it’s the relative changes in the two prices that matter.) A second way we describe the air pressure anomalies over the tropical Pacific is the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (EQSOI). The EQSOI is based on pressure differences between two regions located on the equator (Figure 3). The SOI is monitored because it has a very long record available, stretching back to the 19th century; the EQSOI depends on satellite observations, which means it is a shorter record, but it gives a better picture of what’s happening right along the equator. Figure 3. Two ways of measuring the Southern Oscillation: the SOI and the EQSOI. Both depend on comparing the strength of pressure anomalies in different parts of the Pacific basin. Map by . As of the end of June, both the SOI and the EQSOI are at +0.2 (they have trended downward over the past few months), and the wind patterns are roughly average over the tropical Pacific, with some slight weakening of the trade winds toward the end of the month. There is increased convection in the central Pacific, but also some over Indonesia… all of which says we’re still waiting for the atmosphere to get dressed in its El Niño clothes and come out to play. However, we think it’s likely that the atmosphere will get on board soon, and we’re still predicting El Niño, with about a 70% chance that conditions will be met in the next few months, and around an 80% chance by this fall. If you’re interested in how the ocean and atmospheric conditions are evolving, CPC has weekly updates available. Thanks to David Stroud for his help with this post. Submitted by Dale on Thu, 07/10/",

    "content": "In the July 10 update and ENSO discussion, we said the atmospheric part of ENSO doesn’t seem to be responding to the ocean. El Niño requires that both be in sync and coupled with each other. Why is the atmosphere acting aloof to the rather warm ocean? This development may be especially surprising to folks given the rumors and speculation of a very strong El Niño that followed March’s oceanic Kelvin wave. In June, the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia made an interesting observation that might shed light on the lack of coupling between the ocean and atmosphere (1). They pointed out that an anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) gradient was not in place across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Like the gradient of a hill on a highway, an SST gradient describes a change in temperature across the ocean surface from one location to another (2). The maps below show the typical evolution of SST anomalies leading up to wintertime El Niño events (winter is when ENSO is strongest). In this post, the SST gradient will refer to the difference in SST anomalies. “Anomalies” are the departures from the average state of the atmosphere or ocean. Blue shading shows where SSTs are below average, and red shading shows where SSTs are above average. In this case, the gradient refers to the more negative (cooler) SST anomalies in the western Pacific (blue shading) and the more positive (warmer) SST anomalies in the eastern Pacific (red shading).

So, we’ve gone from an estimated 1-in-5 chance that we won’t have an El Niño to a nearly 1-in-3 chance. However, 65% is still almost twice the climatological likelihood – that is, the long-term average of how often we experience El Niño conditions – so forecasters are still predicting El Niño will develop. So, why the decrease in the odds of El Niño? Last month, we discussed how the atmosphere has yet to respond to the sea-surface temperatures, and Michelle went into a bit more depth about a possible explanation for why the atmospheric response may be delayed. As of the beginning of August, we still haven’t seen a strong atmospheric response (the SOI is -0.2, and the EQSOI is 0.1), and the sea-surface temperature in the central-Eastern Pacific has cooled, leading the weekly Niño3.4 index to drop to -0.1°C by the end of the month. A few other observations have contributed to the somewhat more conservative forecasts, such as the slightly below-average (cooler) ocean heat content. Given these observed conditions, why are chances even as high as 65%? There are a few different considerations that are leading forecasters to these probabilities, including computer model forecasts of sea-surface temperature, and forecasts that the recently developed westerly wind anomalies along the equatorial Pacific may continue. The forecast takes into account several dynamical climate models, including the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2, Fig. 1) and the eight-model National Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). One of the many products of these models is the forecast for the Niño3.4-region sea surface temperature. The models are run many times to form an ensemble of forecasts, each time with a slightly different set of “initial conditions” – that is, the observed fields (such as temperature, air pressure, and so on) that provide the starting point for the forecast. A common way to get different initial conditions is to run the model a few times per day, for example at midnight, 6 a.m., noon, and 6 p.m. The results of the many runs are averaged to yield the ensemble mean, a kind of model consensus. Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) ensemble forecast for Nino3.4 sea-surface temperatures. Figure from CPC. CFSv2, which is run four times per day (each colored line in Fig. 1 represents one “model run”, and the black dashed line shows the ensemble mean) continues to consistently forecast a weak-to-moderate El Niño, peaking in the early winter. In addition, all of the NMME models are still calling for El Niño conditions to develop, with most in the “weak” range of +0.5°C to +0.9°C (Fig. 2). Why do forecasters lean toward trusting the models, despite the fact that conditions seem to be trending away from an El Niño-friendly state? Among the reasons is that the CFSv2 predicted the current dip in sea surface temperatures in the Niño3.4 region in both May and June, which indicates they have a good handle on how the climate is behaving. That lends credibility to the prediction of El Niño by fall/winter. Several of the NMME models also predicted the dip in July (Fig. 2; the CFSv2 that’s included in the NMME is the same model as that shown in Fig. 1.) July North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) ensemble forecast for Nino3.4 sea-surface temperature. Figure from CPC. One way that forecasters evaluate model output is by counting how many of the individual runs fall into a specific category, such as “above normal”, “near normal”, or “below normal.” The number of runs in each category, divided by the total number of model runs, gives us a percentage (see Fig. 3 for an example.) The black box in Fig. 3 indicates the Niño3.4 region; as you can see, more than 70% of the model runs fall in the “above average” category for the December-January-February sea surface temperature forecast.

Plants, Soils & Climate, Utah State University Scientists and natural resource managers are closely watching the potential development of El Niño as it might increase rainfall in California and bring relief to the severe drought there (see footnote 1). In the western United States, drought often brings a double punch: water shortfall plus wildfires. The West as a whole has experienced a relatively quiet fire season thus far, with fewer than 3 million acres burned between January 1-August 25 compared to the 10-year average of 5.4 million acres (see National Interagency Fire Center for more information). But California is well ahead of its 5-year average. Numerous studies, including the latest National Climate Assessment, have reported a substantial increase in fire size and area burned in the Southwest over the past 30 years; these trends are projected to continue increasing in the future. The reason is intuitive: warmer temperatures, earlier springs, and faster snowmelt are driving the increases, and these trends are expected to continue along with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. How could the upcoming El Niño–if it occurs–affect the wildfire threat? Looking at Figure 1, we see significant year-to-year variability embedded in the long-term increase in area burned by fires. Some scientists believe much of this variability arises from the El Niño-La Niña cycle, though finding direct correlations between ENSO and wildfires is not straightforward (2). The rather short records of climate and fires do not help, either. (top) Massive plumes of smoke from wildfires in California in October",

If it seems like each month we’ve been saying “… in the next few months,” you may be wondering what’s going on. Isn’t an ENSO event (either El Niño or La Niña) supposed to develop in the late spring or summer, peak in the winter, and return to normal conditions in the spring? Generally speaking, yes. But, of course, it’s not always so simple. ENSO is seasonally “phase-locked,” meaning the events do follow a seasonal cycle, due to a series of physical processes that are a topic for a later post. However, it’s a complex system, and there is a lot of variation in the timing. First, it’s important to note that our “well observed” record of the tropical Pacific Ocean goes back only about 60 years–really a blink of an eye when it comes to the climate. Over the last decade or so, there have been several studies of fossil corals, tree-rings, cores from lake beds, and other paleoclimate records, as well as computer model runs simulating the past climate. These studies have identified the consistent presence of an ENSO cycle for over millions of years (Ivany et al.,",

    "content": "One of the best things about this blog is the number of excellent comments we get on each post. And after spending some time reading your comments for inspiration, I’ve come to several conclusions. One: people really care about the forecast for this winter and two: people are curious about climate change’s impact on ENSO. While I cannot tell you about snow this winter (full disclosure: I love snow and hope for a lot… everywhere. Always.), I can discuss the impact this grand experiment we have started with our atmosphere—climate change—could have on ENSO. In short, if you are someone who wants more or stronger ENSO events in the future, I have great news for you–research supports that. If you are someone who wants fewer or weaker ENSO events in the future, don’t worry–research supports that too. Truth be told, because of how important and popular this question is, I wish I had a more confident answer. But, it is not possible at the moment. Let me explain why. If there is one bit of knowledge you should leave the ENSO blog with, it is that ENSO is a complex system of give and take between the atmosphere and the ocean (see here or here or maybe here, and just for good measure here). Imagine a dining room whose light is controlled by a dimmer switch. If you want to make the room brighter, adjust the switch. Now, imagine instead of one dimmer switch on the wall there are hundreds, all of which affect the amount of light in the room. That light is ENSO. And climate change is some bratty kid who goes into the room and fiddles with each switch differently. Will the end result of his fiddling be a brighter room (i.e. stronger or more frequent ENSO) or a darker room (weaker or less frequent ENSO)? Hard to say. We’ve already discussed some of these “switches,” or feedbacks, in past blog entries. Michelle explained something called the Bjerknes feedback, which deals with a relationship between tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) and winds. In a guest post next week, Columbia professor Adam Sobel will describe another type of feedback between the tropical SSTs and the overlying atmosphere. These are just two: many other switches exist, all of which could be affected by climate change. So, for example, if sea surface temperatures (SST) warm more in the central or eastern Pacific than in the western Pacific, that could change the magnitude of the sea level pressure difference from west to east, which in turn, helps to control how strong the trade winds are, which helps control how much upwelling of cold water occurs in the eastern Pacific, which controls how strong the trade winds are. If you feel like I am talking in a loop, you would be correct. Figure 1: Idealized schematic of atmospheric and oceanic conditions across the equatorial Pacific Ocean in normal conditions (top) and in a warmer world (bottom). a) On average, the western Pacific is warmer (darker red) than the eastern Pacific, and easterly trade winds in the Walker Circulation are relatively strong (thick arrows).

Strong El Niño events add a few tenths of a degree Celsius to the global average surface temperatures.

Many studies, using both long-term climate model simulations and observed data, have found that ENSO changes on decadal (10-year) or longer timescales. This low-frequency or interdecadal variability includes changes in ENSO strength (variance) and frequency (how often events re-occur). In other words, in one decade, the pattern may be weak El Niño events followed by weak La Niña events every other year, and then the next decade the pattern may be just a handful of strong, irregularly spaced events.

    "content": "Pretend someone is willing to bet you $50 that El Niño will not occur. Before you jump at it, you might want to know what the chances of El Niño are, right? So you then look up your favorite model prediction and discover there is a 90% chance of El Niño. The odds are in your favor. You go for it and take the bet. But something happens and you lose. El Niño doesn’t occur. Oh the horror! Does that mean the model is totally useless? After all it forecasted a 90% percent chance of an El Niño and it didn’t happen. You might think that means the model was awful and next time you may not trust your money with such a prediction. These sorts of bets occur all the time. And probabilistic forecasts (models that tell you there is a certain percentage (%) chance of an outcome) are becoming more popular. An example is FiveThirtyEight’s election and sports predictions. But, despite their popularity, it is easy to misunderstand what these models are telling you. Normally, we like to think that a prediction is either “right” or “wrong.” However, there is value in such probabilistic models even when they appear to be flat-out “wrong.” Let’s look more closely at your bet. There was a 90% chance of El Niño. That means there was a 10% chance of no El Niño. Phrased another way, it means that given similar starting conditions, 1 in 10 times El Niño won’t develop at all. Unluckily for you, the 1 non-El Niño time appeared on the very first try! Maybe if you had hung in there and kept making bets, the next 9 times would all have been El Niños (1). You would have won $50 x 9 = $450! A nice chunk of change: that is why it makes sense to play a long game. But if you only played the game once, becoming discouraged in that first attempt, you would not have been able to take advantage of such a model because you might have thought the model was flat out “wrong.” Illustration by Emily Greenhalgh, . No resemblance to the author—or implication that she gambles—intended. This can work the other way too. Say, in that very first turn, you won! There was a 9 in 10 chance of El Niño and then El Niño occurred. You assume this is a great model that is “right!” However, even that confidence is premature; in this one try, you just happened to be in that 9 in 10 moment. You very well could have been in the other category though it was less likely. In fact, if the model is reliable 1 of the 10 times must result in no El Niño (we don’t know when it will occur). It might seem strange, but a model is slightly unreliable if it forecasts a 90% chance of a certain outcome occurring and that observed outcome actually happens 100% of the time (or any % other than 90%). In a reliable model, the forecast probability should equal the historical probability over a long observational record More simply: if you are flipping a coin, you would forecast that over a lot of coin flips, you would flip 50% heads and 50% tails. This is your prediction model: you expect the coin is equally weighted on each side and so there is a 1 in 2 chance of heads or tails. If the coin was heads in the very first coin flip, you don’t then assume your model is right or wrong. You assume that you haven’t flipped the coin enough to see whether your model is reliable. Over many flips (or long history), you should observe an outcome that is close to 50% heads and 50% tails. Sometimes we show how good a probabilistic model is in a reliability diagram. We look at a longer period of time (30 years of past forecasts, or hindcasts) and ask how good the model was in predicting the chance of El Niño. Now keep in mind, as Tony has described previously, there are three possible outcomes in ENSO outlooks: a % chance of El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral. Here is a reliability diagram for 6-month predictions from the CFSv2 model showing the reliability of probabilities of El Niño (red line that is labeled “above”) and for La Niña (blue line that is labeled “below”): Reliability diagram for 6-month lead predictions from the NCEP CFSv2 model of the Nino-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific, which is used to classify ENSO events. The red curve shows the reliability for the model's El Niño predicitons, the blue curve shows the reliability for La Niña predictions, and the black diagonal line shows what the graph would look like if the model were perfectly reliable. Probability bins are 10% wide, except for the top and bottom, which are 5% wide. Figure courtesy of Michael Tippett (Columbia) and modified by Fiona Martin for Climate.gov. The straight, black diagonal line shows the result for an ideal model with perfect reliability (the forecasted chance = historical chance in observations). What this figure shows us is that CFSv2 provides “overconfident” predictions 6 months out (2). That is, when it forecasts a 90% chance of El Niño, El Niño is actually observed about 60% of the time (red line). The models generally become more reliable (closer to the black diagonal line) for predictions made closer to the time the forecast is made (e.g. lead-0). Probabilistic forecasts might seem wishy-washy at first glance. Isn’t it just a way to cover one’s backside if a prediction is “wrong?” However, a single forecast is not enough to tell you whether your prediction is “good” or “bad.” It’s over the long haul, when making bets on probabilities can pay off. (1) Odds are good that the next 9 times would not have all been El Niños because the system doesn’t remember whether or not the first time was an El Niño. It requires a longer period of time to make sure your bet fully paid off (and assumes a reliable model). The reason for this is that randomness dominates in shorter records. You can envision this randomness occurs when you flip a coin. It is not surprising to see a run of consecutive heads or tails: H – T – H – H – H – T. Over a longer period of time with more coin flips, the net outcome will occur closer to 50%, but in a shorter number of flips the coin and model might seem unreliable and will often will deviate from 50% in either direction. (2) Note that this figure has some jagged curves… this is a reflection of the lower number of cases in some bins. If we had, say 100 years of past predictions, then we would have a better estimate how reliable the model is (see footnote #1). Also, this is showing just the “raw” data from CFSv2. At NOAA CPC, we statistically correct the raw model output from CFSv2 (using hindcasts of CFSv2 data) in order to obtain predictions with better reliability. Despite the correction, CFSv2 remains slightly overconfident for long lead forecasts. Here is an example of what a statistically adjusted CFSv2 reliability diagram looks like (same as the figure above except adjusted using the statistical correction in Barnston and Tippett,",

    "content": "The first Thursday of every month is when we do the CPC/IRI ENSO status update, when NOAA officially answers the question “Are we there yet?” This month, the answer is...close, but no cigar. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Niño3.4 region of the Pacific were quite warm during November, with the most recent weekly Niño3.4 index value at +1.0°C above average. The threshold for El Niño conditions is +0.5° above average for one month, and most of the climate models are forecasting that SSTs will stay above average for at least a few more months. Then why haven’t we changed from an “El Niño Watch” (favorable for development of El Niño conditions) to an “El Niño Advisory” (El Niño conditions are present)? First, a quick review of what we mean by “El Niño conditions.” There are three components: (1) A one-month SST anomaly of +0.5°C or greater in the Niño3.4 region (check!), (2) An expectation that the warm SSTs will meet or exceed that threshold for the next few months (seems very likely!), (3) An atmospheric response typically associated with El Niño (not quite there yet). Summary of NOAA decision process in determining El Niño conditions.  drawing by Glen Becker and Fiona Martin. In a nutshell, the typical El Niño atmospheric response includes reduced rainfall over Indonesia, more rainfall over the central Pacific, and some weakening of the low-level easterly winds and upper-level westerly winds (the Walker circulation) along the equator. As of the beginning of this month, we have seen reduced Indonesian rainfall, but we have not seen more rain over the central Pacific (the opposite, in fact), and changes in the Walker circulation are unclear. The most common way of looking at the rainfall patterns in the tropics is to use outgoing longwave radiation, which is monitored by satellites. Solar energy reaches Earth as shortwave radiation, is absorbed by the surface, and heats it up. The warmed surface then radiates longer-wavelength energy back out to space. This outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is intercepted by clouds, so when the satellites see less OLR than average in a location, it was probably cloudier—and in the tropics, that means rainier—than usual there. And vice versa: more OLR means fewer tropical clouds and less rainfall. Figure 2 shows the average November OLR anomaly over the tropical Pacific. That big orange spot near the Date Line means higher OLR than average: fewer clouds and less rainfall. With El Niño conditions, we’d normally expect more rain than usual in this region, so the decreased rain tells forecasters that the atmosphere may not be adequately coupled to the warm SSTs yet. The presence of convection (storminess) in this region matters so much because this is how El Niño communicates between the equatorial Pacific and the higher latitudes, kicking off a cascade of global impacts.

His unchanging location is associated with the persistent changes in tropical rainfall and winds that we have previously described as being linked to ENSO. Now imagine another bike rider entering the stage on the left and pedaling slowly across the stage, passing the stationary bike (ENSO), and exiting the stage at the right. This bike rider we will call the MJO and he/she may cross the stage from left to right several times during the show. So, unlike ENSO, which is stationary, the MJO is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days, on average. This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from ENSO, which once established, is associated with persistent features that last several seasons or longer over the Pacific Ocean basin. There can be multiple MJO events within a season, and so the MJO is best described as intraseasonal tropical climate variability (i.e. varies on a week-to-week basis). The MJO was first discovered in the early",

However, signs that the atmosphere was responding to the warmer-than-average ocean waters were inconclusive, and we decided to hold off on declaring the presence of El Niño conditions for the moment. Was that the right decision? Why is this particular forecast so difficult? This month, I’m going to take you behind the scenes, into the forecast process. The CPC/IRI ENSO* team currently consists of eleven forecasters. The forecasters use a variety of statistical and dynamical computer model forecasts, information from different climate monitoring systems, and personal knowledge. As the team develops the forecast, we also seek input from several other climate experts at NOAA. Each forecaster provides a prediction for the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), the three-month average sea surface temperature anomaly in the Niño3.4 region. This is a 3-category probability forecast: one probability that the ONI will be below -0.5°C, one that it will be above +0.5°C, and one that it will be between the two. These forecasts extend out to ten months into the future. For example, this month’s first forecast period is for the December-January-February average, and the last is for August-September-October",

But we have also mentioned other ways of measuring ENSO. Here, we will review some of them and then provide reasons why several different indicators are best for monitoring ENSO. Historically, an index has been a common way to summarize the ENSO status. An index is a number scale in which all the individual factors needed to describe a complicated phenomenon are boiled down to a single number. That single number then can be tracked over time. The oldest indicator of the ENSO state is the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI): the difference between the atmospheric pressure at sea level at Tahiti and at Darwin (1); see Fig. 1.

    "content": "At the beginning of this month, we find ourselves looking at conditions in both the ocean and the atmosphere that appear a bit like El Niño. Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Niño3.4 region have been at or above +0.5°C for the last few months, and the forecast calls for a 50-60% chance the Niño3.4 index will remain above +05°C through the late winter and into spring. However, we still haven’t checked the box saying we have “El Niño conditions.” Why not? Mostly, it's because even though there are some promising signs that the atmosphere may be responding to the warmer equatorial Pacfic, we've seen a lot of fluctuations over the past year. It will take more than a couple of weeks to convince us El Nino has really \"locked in.\" For the last few months, rainfall in the central equatorial Pacific has been less than average (as indicated by outgoing longwave radiation, see this post for more on that) - the opposite of what we’d expect to see from El Niño. During the last couple of weeks of January, that changed, and there was more rainfall than average around the Date Line. Related to these recent changes, the January Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (EQSOI) dropped to -1.0, after months of hovering around zero (negative EQSOI indicates a weaker Walker Circulation, often associated with El Niño). Another indicator of possible El Niño conditions is the westerly wind anomalies that developed just east of the Date Line in the middle of January. And, to add to this El Niño sundae, yet another downwelling (warm) Kelvin wave has formed. So what do we want, a cherry on top? Here’s the cause for pause: all these signs have developed over just the past couple of weeks. El Niño is a climate phenomenon, meaning it is an average state over several months (or seasons), and not a short-term weather event. So, while all these signs are promising, we’d like to see them hang around for a little while longer before we declare El Niño conditions. Think of a rock sitting in a stream. The water bubbles and splashes, but generally goes around the rock, and its path is determined by the placement of the rock. But a couple of alternate scenarios could play out here. For example, under certain conditions the rock could move, and perhaps get pushed over to the other side of the stream and settle down there. The water in the stream would then have a different average path than it did before. Another possible scenario is the rock just rolls around in the stream and doesn’t settle at all. In that scenario, the stream's path would be constantly shifting, never settling into one pattern. The atmospheric disturbance caused by El Niño is like a rock that influences where a stream flows. When the disturbance sets up in one place for long stretches of time, the flow of weather around becomes persistently altered. It takes more than a couple weeks for forecasters to tell whether the atmospheric disturbance is \"settled in\" or whether its more like a stone tumbling around in a stream. Photo by Emily Becker. In this analogy, the rock is ENSO, and its state makes the weather (the water in the stream) more likely to flow one way or another. Right now, several pieces look favorable for a shift in conditions, but we want to see if the rock is just rolling around a bit, or if it’s more permanently settling into a new location. Over the past year, the stream has been winning, and the rock hasn’t settled. It’s easy to look back on a period of time and see the overall pattern, rather than just the short-term fluctuations. During every El Niño event, there are times when the atmospheric conditions don’t reflect a weakened Walker Circulation. However, the idea is that the average over the lifetime of the event will show a tendency toward this atmospheric response. The tricky part for forecasters is determining if current conditions are just more fluctuations in the weather, or if they are part of a larger, longer-lasting climate pattern. There are some other factors that are causing us to hesitate over the likelihood of El Niño emerging. For one thing, during the late winter and early spring it can be tough for the ocean and atmosphere to couple and reinforce each other because, climatologically, the east-to-west equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) gradients and winds become weaker as the Northern Hemisphere warms up. The model guidance suggests the positive Niño-3.4 SST anomalies will continue, but they increasingly show a wide variety of possibilities later in the year (Fig. 1).

Much like how forecasters didn’t declare the Dust Bowl drought over every time it rained, we’re not convinced we’re seeing El Niño conditions. The signs are there, though, and if they persist through the next month, we might very well have something different to say. Submitted by Franklin Ormaz… on Fri, 02/06/",

Part 2 looked more closely at one such way to grade our forecasts, called the Heidke Skill Score (HSS). The HSS breaks down the forecast into grid boxes spanning the United States, and then for each grid box showing the forecasted category (above-normal, near-normal, below-normal) with the highest probability, we check how often the forecast was the same as reality. As a refresher, please check out the first figure in my last post. If movie trilogies have taught me anything, it’s that by the last part in the series, you have to recycle previous plot points or images to keep things interesting. There we saw what the forecasts looked like if each grid box represented the category with the highest forecast probability, as well as what the HSS was for each forecast (click the tabs to toggle between the maps and scores). Any score > 0 means the forecast was better than a random guess. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) does not issue seasonal forecasts that look this way. Instead, CPC seasonal forecasts show different probabilities for each forecast category (above-normal, below-normal, near-normal). The HSS ignores probabilities. As defined in the previous blog post, if the forecast shows a 40 percent chance of above normal, 33 percent chance of near normal, and a 27 percent chance for below normal, the HSS evaluates the forecast as if it is instead a forecast for 100 percent chance of above-normal temperatures. Obviously, this is a drawback. It’s like going to see your first place hockey team play (Go Islanders!), a team that wins far more often than they lose, and being shocked if they are defeated.

    "content": "Over the last several months, we’ve seen warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific, including the Niño3.4 region, which we track as one indicator of El Niño. The seasonal Niño3.4 Index has been at or above 0.5°C since September, and the most recent weekly Niño3.4 index was +0.6°C. The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled phenomenon, though, so we also monitor the atmosphere for signs that it is responding to those positive SST anomalies. For the last few months, we’ve been seeing some suggestions of borderline atmospheric El Niño conditions, but until this month we were below that borderline. This month, we’ve finally crept above it, and thus NOAA is declaring the onset of El Niño conditions. Summary of NOAA decision process in determining El Niño conditions.  drawing by Glen Becker and Fiona Martin. What’s different this month? For starters, it’s the second month in a row with a negative value for the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index (EQSOI, -0.5 for February), one indicator of a weakened Walker Circulation. Also, the pattern of below-average rainfall in the central Pacific, which was very inconsistent with El Niño, recently transitioned to near-average rainfall (as indicated by outgoing longwave radiation). The increased rainfall we were seeing in the western equatorial Pacific continued. Late January and February saw a couple of westerly wind bursts over the central tropical Pacific, and the forecast for the first two weeks of March suggests these winds will continue. When the winds in this region turn more westerly, they can encourage movement of warmer surface waters eastward and either trigger or strengthen downwelling Kelvin waves, leading to warmer SST anomalies in the central and eastern parts of the tropical Pacific. Also, over the last month, we saw an increase in sub-surface heat content and the growth of a moderate downwelling Kelvin wave. This suggests that there is likely to be a continuing source of warmer-than-average ocean temperatures for the next couple of months, potentially encouraging the continuation of the weak atmospheric coupling. On the other hand—showing that we are still very close to the borderline—the Tahiti - Darwin SOI, another indicator of ENSO (though farther off the equator compared to the EQSOI), was +0.2 for February. Also, the “near average” rainfall in the central Pacific combined with above-average rainfall in the western Pacific is not a strong indication of El Niño conditions. As we’ve discussed before, a strong signal would be above-average rainfall in the central and eastern Pacific, and below-average rainfall over Indonesia. Going forward, we will need to continue to monitor whether pressure and rainfall across the equatorial Pacific remain consistent with El Niño conditions. At this time, these are extremely weak El Niño conditions, during a time of year when the influence of El Niño on weather patterns in North America or other locations outside of the Tropics is weakening. For example, historical precipitation patterns associated with El Niño show that only about 3 of the past 10 El Niño years exhibited above-average rainfall in California during March-April-May (map pair below). Another way of looking at the historical relationships shows that ENSO has very little correlation to precipitation over North America during the spring.

We think the odds are roughly 70% that El Nino conditions will persistent though summer and above 60% that they will last through fall. First, let’s catch up on the details of that atmospheric response. One of the signs that the atmosphere is responding to El Niño’s warmer sea surface temperatures is a westerly wind anomaly near the surface. Usually, surface winds along the equator—the trade winds—blow from the east to the west (“easterly” winds). That easterly flow helps keep warm surface waters piled up in the western side of the Pacific. When these easterly winds relax, or even turn westerly (blowing from west to east), they often allow some of that warm surface water to move back toward the central or eastern Pacific *.

    "content": "This is a guest post by Eric Guilyardi, who is a professor in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading (NCAS Climate) in the UK and is affiliated with the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) in Paris, France. He has led various efforts to diagnose ENSO in state-of-the-art climate models, with a focus on how ENSO responds in a changing climate. On a global scale, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of seasonal and year-to-year climate variability. Originating in the tropical Pacific, it affects many regions of the globe via atmospheric or oceanic teleconnections. Hence, we climate scientists are frequently working to understand ENSO itself or having to take it into account as we study other aspects of climate (e.g., regional drought). It is the 800-lb gorilla in the room. Understanding the main mechanisms of ENSO has given us the ability to operationally forecast it a season or more ahead. This success is mostly due to the advent of coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (CGCMs) that encapsulate the complexity of the physics and dynamics of the climate system as we understand it. Just as for weather forecasts, the future evolution of the atmosphere can be predicted by knowing the observed atmosphere and ocean state at a given time and applying the equations of motion. ENSO results from numerous interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, as explained below. This means it is an emergent property resulting from the basic laws of physics and thermodynamics that govern the climate system. Hence, in models, there is no line of code or button to press to “have” ENSO. Therefore being able to reproduce ENSO as such an emergent property of climate models is a compelling testimony of the quality of these models.

Dashed contour shows the location of the strongest positive SST anomaly during El Niño (the Niño 3 region). , based on original provided by Eric Guilyardi. The challenges in modeling ENSO are nevertheless plentiful. They all have to do with the complex interactions of the oceanic and atmospheric processes involved—and there are many (seen in the figure above). We can distinguish three related challenges: the extent of theoretical understanding, limited observations, and errors in our models. These challenges are partially interrelated. Theoretical understanding of ENSO is still a domain of active research. Does ENSO behave like a self-sustained pendulum of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system? Does the pendulum weaken over time and require an external source of energy to kick it? And, if so, is that kick coming from atmospheric noise like the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) or from regions outside the tropical Pacific? What initiates an event? Why are some events more extreme than others, like the one in",

It’s like trying to predict the next episode of Mad Men based on the tiny amount of detail given in the “as seen on the next episode” clips. As we know from Tom’s posts on verification (here, here, here), there are many ways to measure the accuracy, or skill, of seasonal climate predictions. Here, we will focus on just one measure (1), but there are other ways to gauge the spring barrier. What is the Spring Barrier? Is the Spring Barrier like a brick wall? In other words, do we smack right into it and cannot see or predict anything beyond it? No, not really. It is more like a lull or a valley in ENSO forecasting accuracy. After the spring (or the autumn for our friends in the Southern Hemisphere), the ability of the models to predict becomes increasingly better. Keep in mind that, in general, the skill of the models get better the closer you get to the period of time you are predicting. If you want to know whether it is going to rain, you are usually better off using a prediction the day before than you are a week out. The same is true in seasonal climate outlooks.

Now that we’re emerging from the spring barrier, this month’s update provides a first guess of the potential strength of El Niño. It’s harder to predict the strength of the event than it is to predict its duration, so we are less confident about that, but forecasters currently favor a “strong” event for the fall/early winter. By “strong” we mean it’s expected that the three-month average sea surface temperature in the Niño3.4 region will peak at more than 1.5°C (2.7°F) above normal. During the month of May, we saw increases in a lot of the ENSO indicators. Sea surface temperature anomalies (the departure from average) were up all across the tropical Pacific, and the most recent Niño3.4 Index was 1.2°C. Both the lower-level and upper-level winds along the equator were substantially weaker than average last month, characteristic of El Niño’s weakened Walker Circulation. This feedback between the higher sea surface temperature anomalies and the atmosphere is critical to both perpetuating and strengthening an El Niño event, and to communicating the effects of El Niño to other areas of the globe.

Well, a few interesting things happened over the past few weeks.

This one is pretty simple to put your thumb on: on average, cooler places and cooler times are warming more quickly than warmer places and times. But first, let’s clarify–and emphasize–what we mean by a “rule of thumb.” Just like in its common usage, a rule of thumb here refers to something generally true often enough to be useful and informative, but not universally reliable–kind of a “two-out-of-three” or “three-out-of-four” kind of situation. So, it's nothing to thumb your nose at, because it’s true more often than not. But it’s also not the case everywhere. Local exceptions to the rule may be in the minority, but they don’t completely stick out like a sore thumb because in certain local situations, the facts can be … wait for it … opposable. With that definition and some horrible puns out of the way, let’s thumb through some data. This rule of thumb is really dominated by the fact that the arctic is the fastest-warming large region on the planet. The Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the rest of the world. This “Arctic amplification” is driven by a handful of factors; the largest of these is the retreat of seasonal snow and ice. As the white stuff goes away, it exposes darker surfaces and land cover underneath; this introduces an additional warming effect across the region.

    "content": "If you’ve been following the development of this El Niño, you may have heard in the media that sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific are at near-record highs. Are we seeing the most powerful El Niño ever? Remember: ENSO is not all about the ocean El Niño is one phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). An ENSO event involves changes in both the sea surface temperatures and in the overlying atmosphere across the tropical Pacific. In the case of El Niño, sea surface temperatures are warmer than average, and the Walker Circulation, which operates like a vertical loop through the tropical Pacific atmosphere—is weakened. This weakness shows up as more clouds and rain in the central and/or eastern Pacific and less over Indonesia, weaker near-surface winds (the trade winds, that usually blow from the east to the west), and weaker upper-level winds. The whole system is important, because there are feedbacks between the ocean and the atmosphere that help to strengthen El Niño. For example, weaker near-surface winds let the surface waters warm in the central and eastern Pacific. The warmer waters lead to more convection (rising warm air), which changes the circulation and further weakens the near-surface winds… and so on! (Check out Tom’s post on the Walker Circulation for more details about the system.) Another thing to remember about ENSO is that meaningful changes take place on seasonal timescales (the average over several months). The important effects of El Niño on the U.S. and other regions are related to its average strength over the fall and winter, not how strong it is on any particular day or week. We do monitor the weekly and monthly changes in the sea surface temperature and the atmosphere to get a hint at where things are headed, but we’ll ultimately judge the strength of this El Niño by its average over the seasons. Yeah, yeah – what about this one?? Right out of the gate, let’s talk about that November sea surface temperature in the Niño3.4 region.

Jim wrote that it would be even more interesting to look separately at Tmax (“maximum temperature,” essentially afternoon high temps) and Tmin (“minimum temperature”, essentially morning lows), because looking only at the average temperature might mask some interesting features. Knowing instantly that Jim was correct, I did what any self-respecting climate writer would do in that situation: I replied by email, pretending that I intended all along to cover Tmax and Tmin in a follow-up post. Please don’t tell Jim or Dennis. Let’s keep that between us. Late-spring/early-summer rainfall should affect summer’s daytime temperatures considerably more than its nighttime temperatures. In the last post, we mentioned that dry soils would tend to just get hotter (“sensible heating”), while wet soils would use some of the incoming energy to evaporate water (“latent heating”), leaving less energy to actually raise the temperature. That’s what Jim and Dennis are getting at. For incoming solar energy to be divvied up, it’s pretty substantially relevant that the Sun be, you know, above the horizon. The maps just below show the relationships between June precipitation and summer’s Tmin (top) and Tmax (bottom). As is usual, Jim was right on the mark. The difference between the two is massive, even more than I expected.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Over the last couple of months, we’ve been witnessing a tremendous fall from the peak of one of the strongest El Niño events on record. Sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean have cooled down over three degrees Fahrenheit since January! The collapse of El Niño was well predicted because El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are almost always strongest during the Northern Hemisphere winter (1). So, the seeds of destruction are sown into most El Niño events, but what exactly are they? To understand the demise of El Niño, one needs to understand why and how ENSO evolves. The entire ENSO lifecycle describes the birth, growth, maturation, and death of warm (El Niño) and cool (La Niña) phases. When and why ENSO events get their start is still a bit of a mystery to us and is why forecasting remains challenging. The death of ENSO is slightly more predictable, but still not preordained (2). While ENSO events don’t always die in the spring or summer, there are times—like recently!—when it’s clear that a eulogy needs to be written. Remember that one of the best crystal balls for the future state of ENSO is what is happening in the ocean. Relative to the fast-changing atmospheric winds, we can literally see the evolution of ENSO in slow-mo because the ocean is tough to push around. One of the reasons we know the seeds of destruction have been planted is because we can watch them unfolding from below. The TAO moored buoy array and Argo buoys that drift and dive several hundred meters below the surface show us what is happening not just at the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, but what has been happening below the surface of the ocean. Recently, there are signs of El Niño’s demise at the surface of the ocean (a strip of cooler sea surface temperatures emerging), but for months we have been watching the equatorial Pacific cool down well below the surface (usually down to 1,000 feet below the surface). You can see one nifty animation of the subsurface ocean in this recent Climate.gov article written by our fabulous editor Rebecca Lindsey (3). Temperature anomalies (departures from normal) across the depth of the equatorial Pacific Ocean (shown from the surface to 300 meters/984 feet below the surface). Red shading shows where temperatures are above average, and blue shading shows where the temperatures are below average. Animation by Climate.gov, based on NCEP GODAS data. But why did this cooling of the subsurface ocean along the equator of the Pacific Ocean occur in the first place? Not so long ago we were witnessing the entire tropical Pacific (surface and subsurface) running a considerable fever, with well above-average temperatures. One theory is called the “recharge-discharge” mechanism (4). Hang with me, and I promise I will explain, but not overload you (but if you want to be overloaded go straight to footnote #5). I. Following La Niña and/or during Neutral conditions, heat builds up in the subsurface ocean around the equator over many months or even years (6). Heat tends to increase initially in the western Pacific Ocean. This is called the “recharging” period (akin to recharging a battery!). II. At some point, this built-up heat in the subsurface ocean becomes large and extensive enough that it begins to influence the surface of the ocean. Generally, there is some trigger that instigates the spread of above-average temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, such as a strong westerly wind burst (7). El Niño occurs when above-average surface temperatures are observed across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. III. As El Niño matures, the warmer than average waters in the upper layers of the equatorial Pacific Ocean drain away from the equator and toward the off-equatorial regions (8). This is called the “discharging” period (9). Why does this discharging occur? Without getting into math that might make your head spin, during El Niño the sea level is higher than average in the central and eastern Pacific, and the winds are anomalously westerly. These conditions are not normal and so an ocean current arises in order to try to bring everything back in balance. This ocean current moves heat away from the equator (“Sverdrup transport” if you want to impress your friends). To the north of the equator, this current moves northward and to the south of the equator, it moves southward. With the near-surface currents pulling water away from the equator, what then happens on the equator? Basically, cooler water from the deeper depths of the ocean moves upward, so it is closer to the surface. IV. Sometimes (not always), the discharging is enough that the equatorial Pacific cools down to the point that a La Niña event occurs, as reflected in below-average temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. After this the heating cycle starts anew. Go back to step I. What’s neat is that we can see this discharging (step III) occurring in measurements going back several months. The animation below is showing the average of oceanic temperatures from the depth to the surface. Temperature anomalies (departures from normal) averaged from the surface to 300 meters (or 984 feet) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Red shading shows where temperatures are above-average and blue shading shows where the temperatures are below-average. Animation by climate.gov using pentad (5-day) averaged data from NCEP GODAS. Watch how you can clearly see the disappearance of the above-average ocean temperatures near the equator of the eastern Pacific Ocean (red shading), with the area of elevated temperatures elongating just to the north and south of equator. Eventually, the below-average ocean temperatures (blue shading) dominate along the equator. Another way to track recharge-discharge is in CPC’s monthly Ocean briefing, which has a diagram showing this idea in action (the slide is titled “Warm Water Volume and Niño3.4 Anomalies”). Discharge is not always this obvious, but given the tremendous El Niño we just had, it is clearly a big player and now all eyes are on whether it cools down enough that a La Niña gets underway.

Currently, forecasters think there’s a slightly better than 50% chance of La Niña developing in August–October and then a 55-60% chance during the winter. Right now, it looks like if La Niña does manage to form and last the five consecutive, overlapping seasons necessary to qualify as an ENSO event, it’s likely to be a weak one. Let’s start by checking in with current conditions. During July, sea surface temperature in the Nino3.4 region of the tropical Pacific was -0.21°C (-0.38°F) below average, according to ERSSTv4, the dataset we use for all our forecast verification. You may have also seen the monthly value for July from the OISST dataset, which was -0.49°C below average. Which one’s right? Check out Tom’s post for details, but in short, these two datasets have different geographic detail: ERSSTv4 is lower resolution, while OISST has a finer grid with more spatial detail. Since the current area of colder-than-average water is a narrow strip along the Equator, the average over the Niño3.4 region can be different depending on the dataset.

In my office, though, we often remind each other that nobody was harmed by “global average temperature.” It’s an important indicator of change, to be sure, but the consequences of a warming world show up locally. One such consequence came to light in July, the warmest month of Earth’s recent history: an anthrax outbreak in western Siberia. The outbreak was traced, at least preliminarily, to a reindeer carcass that had thawed after being frozen for several decades. I won’t pretend to know all the details or the nuances or the epidemiology. I read about it in the newspapers, just like you. But I can confirm that July was really hot there, by western Siberian standards. The natural question—one that my colleagues and I have been asked repeatedly—is whether this is a consequence of climate change. Before we address that, going Beyond the Data, let’s acknowledge something else that happened a little more than a thousand miles away during this very same July. Just off the central Siberian coast, sea ice in the Laptev Sea was darn near as expansive as it’s been in at least 35 years. As analyzed by the National Snow & Ice Data Center, and summarized in NCEI’s report, below-normal temperatures and wind patterns dramatically slowed the summer retreat of sea ice in the area.

That’s the theme for this edition. We’re going old school, and just look at some good old climatology adages and truisms, through the lens of a sturdy, reliable warhorse of a dataset. One question that we get here at NCEI’s Center for Weather and Climate, more so than you might think, are questions about superlatives. “What is the hottest place in America?” and so on. I call these the “Mostest Questions.” To respond to these recurring questions, we set up a handy viewer that helps describe just that. Today’s edition of Beyond the Data will walk through the tool’s output for temperature, focusing on the “why” behind the answers to these Mostest Questions. If you want to explore the data yourself, have at it. Here’re a few things to know before you explore: The values come from NCEI’s Normals dataset, the same project that provides the values you may hear on the evening news (“Today’s normal high in Tulsa is …”). Not every location in America is represented in the data set. It’s limited to about 450 stations for which we have the most comprehensive data. There’s an option to “filter by distance.” This provides some geographic flexibility on the output (“gee, the 20 coldest places in America are in the same part of Alaska”). For the discussions below, I left the filter at the default “don’t give me stations that are within 20 miles of each other” setting. Okay, the obvious questions: what are the warmest and coldest places, year-round, in the country? (average annual temperature) (average annual temperature) No surprises, right? The warmest places are in the south and the coldest places are in Alaska. This really underscores our first climate adage of the day: All else being equal, places closer to the equator are warmer and places closer to the poles are cooler. The underlying reason is straightforward: over the course of a year, the equator catches more of the sun’s energy than the poles.

Since my last post, the tropical Pacific has changed gears, and now forecasters think there’s a 70% chance that La Niña conditions will develop this fall. However, any La Niña that develops is likely to be weak, and forecasters aren’t quite as confident that La Niña conditions will persist long enough to be considered a full-blown episode, giving it a 55% chance through the winter. When I wrote last month, the tropical Pacific wasn’t giving us much evidence that the atmosphere was responding to the slightly cooler-than-average ocean surface, and most of the computer models were predicting that sea surface temperatures would head back toward average. Remember, La Niña (just like El Niño) requires action in both the ocean and the atmosphere. During La Niña, the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific gets cooler than normal, leading to sinking air and less rain above that region, just as the waters near Indonesia get warmer and cause more rising air and rain. This stronger Walker Circulation is completed by stronger east-to-west surface winds and west-to-east upper level winds. Generalized Walker Circulation (December-February) anomaly during La Niña events, overlaid on map of average sea surface temperature anomalies. Anomalous ocean cooling (blue-green) in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and warming over the western Pacific Ocean enhance the rising branch of the Walker circulation over the Maritime Continent and the sinking branch over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Enhanced rising motion is also observed over northern South America, while anomalous sinking motion is found over eastern Africa.  drawing by Fiona Martin. This atmospheric circulation works to enhance the cooler ocean surface, both by blowing across the surface just like you’d cool the surface of your coffee, and also by causing cold water from the deep ocean to rise up. Have you ever blown on the surface of a cup of coffee that has cream in it, but hasn’t been stirred up? You’ll see the cream rise up to the surface, brought there by the circulation you’ve created. Right, sorry. Anyway, we really didn’t see much of this cycle happening during the summer. Some weak indications were there, but nothing really locked in, and nothing was giving forecasters much confidence that La Niña was still developing. Also, the greater cooling in the tropical Pacific Ocean that had been forecast by earlier computer model predictions from the spring and summer didn’t happen. Then, starting around mid-September and continuing through the beginning of October, the trade winds in the central tropical Pacific area picked up.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Last week’s Beyond the Data post examined the extreme temperature climates in the United States, as defined by station “normals.” We promised to come back and look at the precipitation extremes, and here we are. First, a reminder: this information, for a subset of about 450 stations across the United States, is available through this tool. We’ve left the settings at the default “don’t give me stations within 20 miles of each other” setting. Jump in and play with the data yourself! The tables below list the ten wettest and ten driest locations in the United States. Again, these are annual normals, or what would be expected in the mythical “average” year. Unlike extreme temperature stations, which were dominated by where you are on a map, the “ten wettest” list is dominated by what you see when you look out the window on a clear day. It’s no accident that all of these stations are within a few miles of some pretty substantial summits: mountains play a huge role in local precipitation. That cements our first precipitation truism: the windward sides of mountain ranges tend to be significantly wetter than the leeward sides. A map of the 10 places in the U.S. with the highest annual precipitation. Map produced with NOAA NCEI U.S. Climate Extremes Tool. How does that work? The mountains provide the mechanism to lift moist air until it cools enough to condense cloud droplets (or form snowflakes) that are big enough to fall to earth. Or, to put it a little less technically, the mountains will “wring out” the precipitation from moist air. Unlike other weather mechanisms, like cold fronts and warm ocean waters, the mountains don’t go away. Basically, all that’s needed is some moist air being driven toward higher elevations. In most cases, the warmer the air, the more water vapor it can “hold”, and therefore deliver. But, as this list clearly shows, the cool, damp air of the Gulf of Alaska is plenty moist to dump tubs of rain (and snow!) onto Alaska’s southern mountains. Each of the listed Alaskan stations sits along Alaska’s southern coast, where the ocean, the mountains, and a persistent low-pressure feature – the “Alaskan low” – work together to produce prolific rainmaking. The dry side of the table underscores the corollary of the first point: the leeward reaches of mountain ranges tend to be much drier than the windward side. Many of the dry stations sit just east of a significant mountain range. After the moisture is wrung out on the windward side, the air will warm as it descends. This warming brings the air out of saturation – it is plenty capable of “holding” the remaining water vapor – which means precipitation doesn’t happen in most situations. A map of the 10 places with the lowest annual precipitation in the United States. Map produced with NOAA NCEI U.S. Climate Extremes Tool. It’s also worth noting, looking across these lists, that the wet stations are comfortably in the far northern regions of the country. And many of the dry stations, especially those that aren’t obviously in the “rain shadow” of a mountain range, are at sub-tropical latitudes. The world’s major deserts sit at around 25 to 30 degrees latitude. The exceptions to the above are: 1) Barrow, Alaska, which is so far north and so cold, that there’s just not a great deal of precipitation, and 2) Hilo, Hawaii, which is so far south that it’s tropical. Hilo also sits on the east side of a major summit, the windward side in the tropics, where the prevailing winds are easterly. Or, to sum it up in a truism: all else being equal, subtropical latitudes tend dry. The following table lists the places with the most, and the least, days per year with precipitation. What do these tables tell us? They tell us that the places that get the most and least precipitation per year also get the most and fewest days with precipitation. Let’s not overthink this. Finally, the ten snowiest places in the United States: What does this list tell us? Well, first, oddly, apparently having “Hancock” in your airport’s name sets you up for snow. As you’d expect, the more northern and higher-elevation places make the list. But the influence of the Great Lakes really pops in this list. Large, relatively warm bodies of water, especially in the early winter, can juice snow-making storms with even more moisture and atmospheric instability. Being downwind of a Great Lake means you experience this early and often in the winter. A map of the 10 places with the highest annual snowfall in the United States.

Shoot, if one of the strongest El Niño episodes in history didn’t deliver much drought relief to California last winter, what are the chances for significant improvement this year? I’ll attempt to answer these and other questions here in my 5th blog post. If you'd rather watch a video recap of the winter outlook, we have that, too. Mike Halpert of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center talks about La Niña and other climate patterns that are likely to influence winter climate across the United States.  video by Ned Gardiner, Alicia Albee, Kurt Mann, Robert Klein, and Bruce Sales. So what might influence our climate this winter? As you know from the ENSO blog, there is a link between the fall and winter conditions across the tropical Pacific and the average winter climate in the U.S. If the likely La Niña develops, certain patterns of temperature and precipitation would be favored across the country. Over the past few years, we’ve discussed the patterns favored by El Niño, but haven’t really discussed what we often see during La Niña winters. Roughly speaking, La Niña impacts are opposite to what is observed during El Niño winters (see the figure). Typical impacts of La Niña on U.S. winter temperature and precipitation. Such impacts have been associated with past episodes, but all impacts aren't seen with every episode.  drawing by Fiona Martin. So while the southern (and especially southeastern) part of the U. S. is often wetter and colder than average during El Niño winters, La Niña generally favors below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures in those same regions. We also often see opposite patterns across the northern part of the nation, with warmer and drier conditions during El Niño winters and colder and wetter conditions during La Niña years. Before discussing the actual winter outlook, I want to remind readers that these are probabilities (% chance) for below, near, or above average seasonal climate outcomes with the maps showing only the most likely temperature or precipitation outcome (footnote 1). Because the probabilities shown are less than 100%, it means there is no guarantee you will see temperature or precipitation departures that match the color on the map. As we’ve explained in earlier blog posts, even when one outcome is more likely than another, there is still always a chance that a less favored outcome will occur (witness precipitation last winter over the western United States). Given the potential La Niña, it’s not surprising that both the temperature and precipitation outlooks are consistent with typical La Niña impacts. However, because there is still some uncertainty that La Niña will develop and persist through the winter, probabilities on the maps this year are fairly conservative, smaller than the ones in the outlook last year.

It’s looking more likely that the tropical Pacific will transition to neutral conditions by the January – March period.

    "content": "This is a guest post by Dr. Aaron Levine who is a National Research Council postdoctoral associate at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. His research is on ENSO dynamics and predictability, and focuses on how changes in weather (or what is often referred to as “noise” in climate studies) influence the evolution of ENSO. While you can’t set your watch to El Niño or La Niña because it occurs irregularly and sometimes with little warning, when one does emerge it is strongly linked to the calendar month. Typically, events peak during the Northern Hemisphere winter and then weaken or disappear during the spring or summer (1). In part because ENSO is transitioning, the spring is a difficult time to predict whether the upcoming winter will be El Niño, La Niña, or neutral conditions. This has been called the spring predictability barrier and like most barriers it presents additional challenges to get beyond. Currently, there is a hint of a forecast of a future El Niño but the barrier makes it difficult to be too confident in the predictions. That makes this a nice time to review why we are able to predict ENSO at all and what aspects are particularly challenging to predict. Unlike weather prediction, where we rarely have to account for changes in the ocean, in ENSO prediction we have to forecast both the slower, more predictable changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean and the faster, less predictable movements of the atmosphere above it. At the risk of spoiling my punch line, during the spring, the starting conditions of the ocean provide less guidance than at other times of year and they are much less helpful for forecasting El Niño events than La Niña events. While the focus is often on El Niño, research has suggested that it’s sibling, La Niña, is more predictable than El Niño (2). To understand this, we turn to one theoretical basis for ENSO, the recharge oscillator. As discussed in this previous blog post, the recharge oscillator says warmer sea surface temperatures (SST) in the eastern Pacific Ocean along the equator weaken the winds and cause poleward movement of warm ocean water. This effect can be seen from the surface down to ~",

    "content": "The United States has experienced some intense weather patterns lately, including flooding in California and a Nor’easter in New England. We can’t trace these back to a butterfly flapping its wings on the other side of the world, but we can connect them to tropical rainfall patterns that seem just as far away. The tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans have some of the warmest oceans temperatures in the world. They provide plenty of heat and humidity for heavy rain and thunderstorms — storms that are so strong they can change global wind patterns and affect weather around the globe. El Niño and La Niña are the best-known examples of how shifts in those rainfall patterns can have global effects. In some years, the warmest water shifts between the eastern and western parts of the Pacific with the rain following right along. The outflow from these thunderstorms at altitudes of around 40,000 feet above the ocean alters the jet stream over the North Pacific, which in turn affects our weather downstream. El Niño and La Niña drive year-to-year differences in seasonal weather patterns. On the week-to-week scale, the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO)—a global-scale pattern in tropical winds and rain (for more on the MJO, see “What is the MJO and why do we care?”)—can be just as important. The MJO’s thunderstorms typically develop over the Indian Ocean and then move eastward to the Pacific over the course of a month or so. The surface and upper-atmosphere structure of the MJO for a period when the enhanced convective phase (thunderstorm cloud) is centered across the Indian Ocean and the suppressed convective phase is centered over the west-central Pacific Ocean. Horizontal arrows pointing left represent wind departures from average that are easterly, and arrows pointing right represent wind departures from average that are westerly. The entire system shifts eastward over time, eventually circling the globe and returning to its point of origin. Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. Because the MJO moves around the world in a circle, we find it easier to break its movement into eight phases that each happen about a week apart. The globes below show what a typical MJO would look like in each phase. They show average patterns of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) for each phase of the MJO, which are usually about a week apart. Tall thunderheads block the earth’s heat from radiating into space, so OLR is an easy way to measure the strength of those storms. In other words, when a satellite sees much less heat radiating from Earth’s surface than usual—especially in a place as warm as the tropics—it’s a good sign that a towering thunderstorm cloud is blocking the satellite’s view.

What’s behind this verdict? First, a quick review of the recent facts. Sea surface temperatures in the Niño3.4 region (our main region for monitoring and predicting ENSO) were close to average during February, measuring -0.15°C below average in the ERSSTv4 dataset, and +0.14°C above average in the OISST dataset. These two datasets have different input and spatial detail, so they’re usually not in perfect agreement, but they are both telling us the same thing: surface temperatures are more or less normal. (Check out Tom’s post for more on how they can disagree and still be reliable.) Clouds and rain were still somewhat less than average in February over the central Pacific, and greater than average over the Maritime Continent (the group of islands north of Australia and south of China), in a La Niña-like pattern.

In short, many of the computer models we use are predicting the development of El Niño over the next several months, but current conditions in the tropical Pacific aren’t showing many of the elements we’d expect ahead of a developing El Niño. We’ve had neutral ENSO conditions since January, and forecasters predict that continued neutral is the most likely scenario through at least June. By September, chances of El Niño rise to about 50%, a slight edge over neutral (~40% chance) or La Niña (~10% chance). We rely on prediction models because they provide the most likely evolution of the ENSO system better than we can compute on our own by eyeballing maps and charts and analyzing what has happened in the past under similar conditions. Right now, many climate forecast models do predict the development of a full-fledged El Niño during this summer or fall. It’s likely that these models are acting on the much warmer-than-average waters near the coast of South America—the “Coastal El Niño” that I’ll get to a little bit later in this post. Predictions for the Niño3.4 region in the east-central Pacific, shown in the figure below, show chances for El Niño ramping up over the next year. Climate model forecasts for the Niño3.4 Index, from the IRI/CPC Prediction Plume. Orange lines indicate the dynamical models and blue lines show the statistical models, with thicker lines depicting the average of the models. Niño3.4 values in excess of +0.5C are reflective of El Niño conditions. Image modified by . While nearly all of the available dynamical models are predicting an El Niño, only about half of the statistical models are, and those that do are predicting a weaker event than the average of the dynamical models. Statistical models are based on previous events, and right now the tropical Pacific does not look much like it has before past El Niños. As we have discussed in the past on this blog, El Niño sets in when the ocean and the atmosphere show coupled behavior—that is, when a stronger link develops between the warming waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and the slowing down of the Walker circulation, in which the westward-blowing trade winds near the surface weaken and the eastward-blowing upper level winds also weaken. Right now, the tropical Pacific Ocean is split. There is warmth in the eastern Pacific Ocean (the Coastal El Niño—I’ll get to that, I promise). But the western and central Pacific Ocean actually look more reflective of cool, La Niña-like conditions!

Unlike two years ago, when the signal that a strong El Niño was developing was clear, most of our prediction tools are suggesting very borderline conditions, making it a tough forecast. Ocean temperatures in the Niño3.4 region have been in neutral territory for a few months now, shifting from slightly cooler than the long-term average to about 0.4°C (0.7°F) warmer than average during April in one of our SST datasets. The “coastal El Niño” that we’ve been watching (much warmer than average sea surface temperatures near the tropical coast of South America) has weakened substantially over the past couple months, to about 0.9°C above average during April. This ocean warming is very significant for Peru and Ecuador, since it can lead to rising moist air and cause thunderstorms over the coastal regions. However, the coastal El Niño doesn’t always precede the kind of El Niño that we forecast here at the blog, so it is limited as a predictive tool.

After months of suggesting an elevated chance for El Niño to develop, the CPC/IRI forecast has flattened out, and neutral conditions are expected (50-55% chance) to continue through the fall. In fact, the Nino3.4 region (a key ENSO monitoring area in the tropical central Pacific) is hovering around 0.5°C warmer than the long-term average. Yep, that’s the threshold for El Niño, but surely you remember that ENSO is a seasonal phenomenon, meaning those warmer sea surface temperatures need to stick around for several months—long enough to provoke an atmospheric response. Despite the warmer sea surface temperatures, the atmosphere is not behaving like El Niño. During May, the indicators that we track looked very average, including both the upper-level and near-surface winds over the equatorial Pacific and the amount of rain and cloudiness in the central Pacific and Indonesia. The indexes that measure the difference in the atmospheric pressure between the central Pacific and the far western Pacific, the Southern Oscillation Index and the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index, were both close to zero in May, indicating, again: neutral conditions. Most of the recent forecast models predict that the Niño3.4 region will move closer to average temperatures over the next few months. The average of all the dynamical model forecasts in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble flattens out at slightly above the long-term mean for the rest of this year. Averaging all model forecasts together usually produces the best forecast, because it reduces the noise and highlights the signal.

First, though, a quick recap of current conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The sea surface temperature in our favorite Niño3.4 region in the central Pacific was about 0.1°C colder than the long-term average over June – August, smack-dab in the neutral range. The atmosphere also reflected neutral conditions during the summer, with the winds above the equatorial Pacific neither particularly enhanced nor weakened, and an average pattern in the clouds and rainfall. While neutral prevailed during meteorological summer (what we call June – August, while the summer solstice through the vernal equinox is “astronomical summer”), we began to see some indications over the course of August that a change may be afoot. The first of these is the downward trend in central Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies (departure from the long-term mean) from July into August, with the August average in the Nino3.4 region of about -0.4°C, using ERSSTv4 data. One of the many environmental factors that we monitor closely is the temperature of the tropical Pacific below the surface of the ocean. Over the course of a couple of months, areas of cooler or warmer water can grow or move below the surface of the Pacific from west to east along the equator. These blobs (often in the form of oceanic Kelvin waves) often rise to the surface as they approach the eastern Pacific Ocean, and so give us a heads-up of how the surface may look in the near future. It just so happens that during August, an area of cooler-than-average water developed around 50-150 meters (~160-500 feet) below the surface of the Pacific.

Because you never know who will be calling or writing into the Center, each day is a little different, which is exciting. Some days, you might even get to use climate data to help solve a cold case! (All true stories! Find me at an applied climatology conference, and I’ll tell you more.) A view of Ray Lake, on the High Plains of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Like other parts of the Great Plains, the region is prone to extreme dryness. Photo by Natalie Umphlett. Most of the time, simple climate data questions can be answered through a phone call or over email, but other questions need special attention. One of the ways we tackle more complex issues is by working alongside the people who live and work in the states in our region: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The goal of these collaborative, applied climate research projects is to develop climate data and information that can be used to inform local decisions. Current projects underway at the Center include helping cities and towns incorporate climate data and information into planning processes, working with agricultural producers on scenario planning to create more resilient cropping systems, and helping local water resource managers apply FEMA’s Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment process to drought scenarios. Over the past several years, our Center has also been working with Native American tribes in the region to help address their on-reservation climate and drought vulnerabilities. Here in the Missouri River Basin, where much of our work is focused, there are 28 tribes with a diverse set of climate-related challenges. Let’s step back for a moment and discuss why climate hazards may be different among the tribes. First, many of the rivers that flow through the region, like the Missouri River, are fed by distant snowpack from the Rocky Mountains. For places downstream, this makes surface water supply dependent on climate conditions that are relatively far away. In addition, the Great Plains is well-known for its extreme weather (tornadoes, blizzards, and ice storms) and climate (recurring droughts and springs with epic flooding). Fort Washakie, in west-central Wyoming, is home to the tribal headquarters on the Wind River Indian Reservation. Drought is common in the region, and the reservation's water supply is highly dependent on snow and glacier melt from the Wind River Mountains, which appear in the distance of this photo. Photo by Matthew Copeland, Wyofile. Finally, the Great Plains is marked by an extreme east-west precipitation gradient: locations in the east (closer to moisture from the Gulf of Mexico) can receive double, if not triple, the precipitation of places in the west. This gradient alone can lead to significant differences in the ways that people manage and allocate water. For some in the region, mountain snowpack is relied upon for water resources, while others rely on ground and surface water supplies. These inherent challenges, even without taking climate change into account, make a one-size-fits-all approach to activities like water resource management impossible. Now, back to the research! One project that I want to tell you about is with the tribes of the Wind River Indian Reservation. Located in west-central Wyoming, the reservation is home to two tribes – the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho – who depend on snowpack and glacier-fed meltwater flowing through tributaries of the Wind River for their water supply. Recent droughts have impacted the tribes, creating the need for climate and drought information that could help them become more resilient.

    "title": "What about snow during La Niña winters?",
    "date": null,
    "content": "This is a guest post by Dr. Stephen Baxter who is a NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) meteorologist and does applied research on subseasonal-to-seasonal climate variability. In particular he specializes in understanding how the middle-to-high latitude circulation is influenced by the tropics versus other processes. He also has a lot of opinions on Siberian snow cover and the role of the western tropical Pacific in forcing seasonal climate over North America. Recent cold air outbreaks over the north-central and northwestern U.S., along with record cold on Veterans Day in parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, should have people excited about (or dreading) the upcoming winter. My colleagues and I at the Climate Prediction Center have just issued our final outlook for the upcoming “meteorological winter,” that is, December through February. Right now, our official outlook covers only temperature and total precipitation, with the latter combining both liquid and frozen precipitation. However, what about the frozen stuff? What about snow? Because many people remember winters that were either exceptionally snowy or not snowy at all, we get a lot of questions about what the winter forecast portends for seasonal snowfall accumulation. In many parts of the country, snowfall also has major economic and societal ramifications, including water resource management and winter tourism, among others. Snow Way! Tackling this problem is not easy, though. Part of the issue boils down to the technical difficulties of snowfall measurements—a real “problem child” as Deke Arndt (NCEI) puts it. The other issue is related to the difficulties with prediction. As many people in the Northeast corridor are aware, snowfall with any given storm system is a function of the dreaded rain-snow line that separates air masses that are below or above freezing. For any given storm system, the exact boundaries between rain and snow can be hard to predict even days in advance. Luckily, at CPC, we aren’t trying to predict specific events, but the climate instead. We take a step back and see how seasonal temperature and precipitation forecasts might play a role in determining seasonal snowfall accumulation. In regions that receive a large percentage of their cold-season precipitation in the form of snow, increased seasonal precipitation is intuitively related to increased snowfall accumulation. In more temperate areas that receive a relatively small percentage of frozen precipitation, temperature becomes important. Anomalously cold temperatures are, more or less, a necessary condition for snow in those areas. Therefore, a region with a relatively cold winter may find itself on the cold side of storm systems more often. In more mountainous areas, where temperature varies as a function of elevation, colder systems result in snow falling at lower altitudes and more total snowfall coverage over a given region. This is where the long-term warming trends, recently discussed by Tom, become important over western North America. Drier and warmer climate signals will generally result in lower snow coverage. Because a La Niña Advisory was recently issued, we will take a look at how La Niña, in general, affects snowfall across North America. This analysis is part of a broader effort at CPC to better understand and potentially predict seasonal snowfall, made possible in part by a new snowfall dataset (1). La Niña = Skiers Delight over the Northern United States In a nutshell, La Niña is associated with a retracted jet stream over the North Pacific Ocean. The retreat of the jet stream results in more blocking high pressure systems that allow colder air to spill into western and central Canada and parts of the northern contiguous U.S. At the same time, storm track activity across the southern tier of the U.S. is diminished under upper-level high pressure, which also favors milder-than-normal temperatures. The storm track is in turn shifted northward across parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes (2). Based on climate analysis (3) from this new snow dataset, we see that La Niña favors increased snowfall over the Northwest and northern Rockies, as well as in the upper Midwest Great Lakes region. Reduced snowfall is observed over parts of the central-southern Plains, Southwest, and mid-Atlantic. Snowfall departure from average for all La Niña winters (",

Although it will take some time before we can see how this event stacked up with past events, you might have noticed that it has been quite dry over much of the U.S. this winter, with drought expanding across several regions, particularly in the south. Being the big ENSO fans that you are, you might have asked yourself, are these conditions typical in the second winter of a double-dip La Niña? And are there any differences in how the atmosphere responds to La Niña in the second winter relative to the first? Well if either of those questions ever crossed your mind, then you’re in luck! A recent study (1) led by Dr. Yuko Okumura of the University of Texas at Austin addressed how the impacts of La Niña may change from the first winter to the second for double-dip La Niñas like this one. Spoiler alert: Dr. Okumura and colleagues found evidence that U.S. drought and the North Pacific atmospheric circulation anomalies strengthen in the second winter of a double-dip La Niña. With that out of the way, let’s take a closer look at what they found. As Emily discussed recently and as Dr. Okumura’s team also acknowledged, double-dip La Niñas actually are pretty common. Including the current event, we have experienced eight instances in which La Nina conditions in the first winter were followed by La Niña in the subsequent winter.

This is actually a little bit lower than the previous few weeks, but it doesn’t mean that El Niño is less likely. ENSO is a seasonal phenomenon, meaning it’s an average pattern that lasts several months in a row.

Rings of trees growing in temperate climates can indeed tell their age through their annual rings and also help determine the age of wood used to construct buildings or wooden objects. The ages of wooden objects can be revealed by cross-dating, the process of matching ring patterns between wood samples of known and unknown ages. Concentric rings of various widths mark the annual growth of trees. Photo by Peter Brown, Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research. The underlying patterns of wide or narrow rings record the year-to-year fluctuations in the growth of trees. The patterns, therefore, often contain a weather history at the location the tree grew, in addition to its age. In dry environments, such as the Middle East or U.S. Southwest, tree rings typically record wet or dry years, and in cooler areas (high latitudes or high elevation), the ring widths are often a proxy for temperature. Archeologists have used the ring patterns in building timbers to estimate construction dates for some of the world’s most famous buildings, including the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde National Park (nearly 1,000 years old) and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (nearly 1,500 years old).

There are certain states we gravitate to when we sleep, often to maximize comfort. They are our preferred states. Would you be surprised if I were to tell you the atmospheric circulation operates in the same way, that certain patterns or flows appear more often than others because we’re not the only ones who like routine? One of these preferred states is the Pacific-North American Pattern, or as we scientists like to shorthand it: The Almighty P-N-A! (Ok, we don't shout “Almighty!” every time… we whisper it.) I know the presence of a fixed atmospheric pattern sounds a touch odd because most satellite loops of our planet show a fast, chaotic swirl of movement—weather fronts racing through the Plains, cyclones threatening the global tropics, and so on (check out the ever-mesmerizing GOES loops). There’s nothing particularly fixed-looking about it. But, if you slow it down, there are some quite enormous atmospheric flows that appear to be stuck on repeat. But they are not always present, and when they re-occur, they do so irregularly. Similar to how a river will flow faster when pinched between two boulders, the atmosphere has similar disruptions due to Earth’s geography, the spin of the planet, and differences in solar heating. One such semi-permanent feature is the Asian-Pacific jet stream, a fast moving river of air that rips off the coast of Japan and crosses over a large swath of the North Pacific Ocean. We’ve talked about this jet stream before because of how it moves sometimes in association with El Niño and La Niña (ENSO). This jet stream is a major reason the PNA pattern exists; the PNA prefers to exist near the exit region of this jet—and in fact derives some energy from this jet, especially in the winter (1). We could measure the PNA with winds, but it is more often measured by pressure patterns, which are strongly related to winds (many of the atmosphere’s preferred patterns have very visible footprints in pressure) (2). In the positive state of the PNA, above-average pressure is found over the subtropical Pacific (close to Hawaii) and centered over western Canada. Below-average pressure occurs over the North Pacific Ocean and along the southeastern United States. The negative state of the PNA results in the same pattern except with opposite anomalies (regions that have above-average pressure become below-average and vice versa).

El Niño conditions were still evident across the tropical Pacific Ocean during April, as the sea surface temperature in the Niño3.4 region averaged about 0.7°C warmer than the long-term average (via the ERSSTv5 database). Most computer models predict that the ocean surface will stay warmer than average in the Niño3.4 region, with the majority of predictions remaining above the El Niño threshold of 0.5°C through next fall.

Statistical model data (dashed line) from CPC’s Consolidated SST Forecasts.  image from CPC data. However, there is a broad range of potential outcomes shown here, and we’re still within the spring predictability barrier, when forecast models have a tougher time making successful predictions, partly due to the tendency of ENSO to be in transition during the spring. We’re starting to pass that barrier, but we still bear it in mind when looking at forecasts made in early May. The atmosphere also continued to reflect El Niño in April, with more clouds and rain forming over the warmer-than-average waters of the central tropical Pacific, and drier conditions over the far western Pacific and Indonesia, although this pattern was somewhat weaker than during February or March. The near-surface winds in the tropical Pacific, the trade winds, were near average in April. The trade winds usually blow from the east to the west, keeping warm water piled up in the far western Pacific. Changes in these winds are a critical component of the El Niño system. When they weaken in the central Pacific, surface waters can warm, and sometimes allow a downwelling Kelvin wave to form: a large blob of warmer-than-average water that moves from the west to the east under the surface of the Pacific. After a couple of months of weaker-than-average trade winds (what we expect during El Niño conditions), they were near average overall during April. This slight weakening of the typical El Niño signal is in part due to a reawakening Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in the second half of April. The MJO is an area of active storms and convection (rising air) that travels from west to east along the equator. It can circle the globe in about 30-60 days. We’ve talked about the MJO quite a bit on the ENSO Blog and climate.gov, since this pattern can affect US weather, and interact with El Niño and La Niña. The surface and upper-atmosphere structure of the MJO for a period when the enhanced convective phase (thunderstorm cloud) is centered across the Indian Ocean and the suppressed convective phase is centered over the west-central Pacific Ocean. Horizontal arrows pointing left represent wind departures from average that are easterly, and arrows pointing right represent wind departures from average that are westerly. The entire system shifts eastward over time, eventually circling the globe and returning to its point of origin. Climate.gov drawing by Fiona Martin. Near-surface air is drawn toward the MJO-related area of convection. So when the MJO is over the Indian Ocean, the trade winds in the west-central Pacific are stronger than average, because the inflow to the MJO reinforces them. But when the MJO moves into the central Pacific, the trade winds tend to be weaker, because the inflow to the MJO opposes them. After going mostly quiet in mid-March, by mid-April the MJO was showing signs of re-development. The trade winds in the western Pacific during mid-late April were stronger than average (more east-to-west), consistent with what we’d expect when the center of MJO convection is in the Indian Ocean. However, during the first week of May, as the MJO moved into the Pacific, the trade winds weakened substantially in the west-central Pacific.

The June Niño3.4 index, our primary ENSO measurement, was 0.6°C above the long-term average, just above the El Niño threshold of 0.5°C. There is some evidence that the atmosphere over the central Pacific is still responding to that extra heating, as a bit more clouds and rain than average were present in June. The Southern Oscillation Index and Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index were both slightly negative in June, also indicating some continuation of the weakened Walker circulation we expect to see with El Niño. But the upper-level and near-surface winds over the equatorial Pacific, another component of the Walker circulation, were close to average during June. All in all, El Niño is still present, but just barely. As frequent readers of this blog will know, we closely monitor the temperature of the water under the surface of the tropical Pacific. This can tell us if there is a source of warmer-than-average water to supply the surface, continuing to fuel El Niño, or not. In early June, there was a small downwelling Kelvin wave of warmer waters moving eastward under the surface of the Pacific, but this wave has dissipated recently.

But there are other climate drivers that spend time in the ring and have their moments of glory. Here, we will cover some exciting new research that suggests that the land surface, and in particular soil moisture, can sometimes impact atmospheric flows across thousands of miles! One of the great pleasures of working at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center is that some scientists are interested in visiting us and introducing us to the latest ideas in climate research. Dr. Haiyan Teng of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is one such scientist who stopped by to go over her intriguing findings (1) and answer some questions, which are shared below. Dr. Haiyan Teng of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Dr. Teng and her colleagues are trying to answer the question “what would happen to global climate if the soil in the middle of the U.S. were completely dry?” When there is a lot of water held in the soil in this region, sunlight will first go into evaporating it, keeping the surface cooler. If the ground is dry, though, the Sun will heat the surface, ultimately creating a large heat bubble over the central U.S. Beyond the local effects (heat wave, drought), they are exploring how this extra heating changes the global atmospheric circulation patterns. To study this question, Dr. Teng’s team is using a research computer model, the Community Earth System Model (or CESM). They remove soil moisture from the U.S. Great Plains (the boxed region in the figure below) in the Northern Hemisphere summer, creating that bubble of heat, and study the resulting domino effect that ultimately changes the atmospheric circulation across the globe. In the top panel, you can see the resulting “circumglobal teleconnection,” or the changes in atmospheric pressure that form a ring around the Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes. This means that dry soil in the central US may affect the weather and climate not only over the US, but also over many parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia as well! The bottom panel shows what happens when a model simulation is run with the soil moisture left in, but with increased near-surface heating in the same location to mimic the heating effect of reducing the soil moisture. A similar circumglobal pattern arises, which confirms the surface heating is responsible for this effect. Model simulations of May-August 200mb geopotential height anomalies that occur when soil moisture is removed in the boxed region (top panel) or with increased heating in the same region (bottom panel). Orange shading indicates pressures that are above average and blue shading indicates where pressures are below average. Shaded areas indicate statistical significance. Climate.gov map based on NCAR CAM5 data provided by H. Teng. What’s also interesting is this influence is strongest in the Northern Hemisphere summer, rather than in the winter. This is encouraging to forecasters because most climate phenomena, such as ENSO, have their greatest influence in the winter, so better resolving soil moisture in our datasets and prediction systems may improve our summer climate outlooks (2). Although their experiment seems quite exaggerated, their proposed mechanism may have implications in the real world. The results from the idealized experiment suggest that prediction systems that place greater weight on soil moisture deficits could provide better early warning for these events. And what is even more interesting is that climate change experiments suggest soil moisture in the northern contiguous U.S. will decrease under future warming (see top panel in the figure below). At the same time, they also anticipate greater surface temperature variability, with more intense heat waves, by the end of the 21stcentury (bottom panel). Dr. Teng’s research suggests enhanced atmosphere-land interactions are required to explain this connection (3). Projected June-August changes from",

Even though our old friend the Niño3.4 index (that is, the departure from the long-term average temperature in the central tropical Pacific) has spent the last few weeks hovering around 0.5°C above average, the overall El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system is solidly neutral. To qualify for El Niño conditions, we also require an expectation that the Niño3.4 index will remain at or above 0.5°C for at least five consecutive three-month-average periods and that atmospheric patterns will change in response to the warmer central tropical Pacific water. Currently, we have neither of those additional requirements. Most climate models predict that the temperature of the Niño3.4 region will remain close to average through the spring. As the ENSO Diagnostic Discussion says this month, the forecasters believe “the recent oceanic warmth reflects sub-seasonal variability and is not indicative of an evolution toward El Niño.” Though there still is a ~25% chance of El Niño in the winter, which means it’s worth keeping an eye on the evolution of the surface temperatures.

As Tom said in his post on the topic, “simply put, the trend is how temperatures and precipitation have changed over some length of time.” Trends are actually more skillful overall than ENSO for informing temperature forecasts, largely because of the patterns from global warming due to human-emitted greenhouse gases. However, ENSO trumps trends for precipitation. When El Niño or La Niña is a no-show, though, trends often become the primary consideration for both temperature and precipitation.

We’re named after ENSO because that’s the 800-pound gorilla, the most influential seasonal climate phenomenon so far identified—check out the FAQ for a lot more info on ENSO. But the global ocean/atmosphere system features many other, smaller gorillas, and some chimpanzees, lemurs, koalas, lions, and a platypus or two. (These are definitely not technical categories, although I might dedicate the rest of my career to making them so.) Some of those other animals climate patterns, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, are carefully monitored because they’re known to affect weather and climate around the world. Others can give us an early glimpse into how ENSO might develop, such as the Pacific Meridional Mode or the South Pacific Oscillation. It’s this second collection of patterns, called ENSO precursors, that I’m going to dig into today. Animation showing seven ENSO precursor patterns. Shaded colors show sea surface temperature (reds = warmer than average, blues = cooler), green lines show sea level pressure (solid = stronger than average, dotted = weaker), arrows show wind direction, and blue lines show wind stress, the force exerted on the water surface by the wind (solid = more than average, dotted = less). Figure by Kathy Pegion, animation by climate.gov. Around the tropics, climate patterns can be identified in several different ways. They can include changes in the ocean surface temperature and/or some change in the atmospheric circulation. Atmospheric circulation changes can be detected in air pressure, wind direction/strength, rainfall, and other indicators. Many are called “oscillations,” which in weather and climate science means a see-saw between two locations—also called a dipole—on an irregular time interval (1). Dozens, probably hundreds, of scientific papers have been written about identifying ENSO precursor patterns, how they might affect ENSO, and how they interact with each other. And, of course, the complexity of the ocean/atmosphere system is such that all these patterns are entangled, with interactions that we are only just beginning to understand. Add climate change on top—suffice to say, this post is just scratching the surface! Since this topic is complicated enough, I’m just going to talk about how precursors influence the development of El Niño, and leave La Niña for another time. In general, precursor patterns affect the development of El Niño by changing the trade winds. These winds usually blow steadily from east to west across the equatorial Pacific, pushing warmer water into the western Pacific and leaving a relatively cooler region in the eastern Pacific as water is drawn up from the deeper ocean. When the trades relax, the warm water in the far western Pacific can begin to move eastward under the surface, in the form of a downwelling Kelvin wave. Sometimes—but not always—when this warm water rises to the surface in the central/east Pacific, it can initiate the atmospheric response in the Walker circulation, which acts to reinforce the warm water, resulting in El Niño conditions. The idea behind tracking precursors is that, if we understand their behavior, we can add to our understanding of how El Niño events develop, both in terms of “will there be an El Niño next winter?” and “if so, what will it look like?” One precursor is the North Pacific Oscillation, which is a pattern of air pressure at sea level in the North Pacific Ocean. Specifically, the pressure in the far north (centered off the west coast of Alaska) is compared to the midlatitudes (draw a line between Tokyo and Santa Barbara). Most of the time during the winter, the air pressure is relatively high over this central region of the North Pacific, forming a subtropical high. When the air pressure here is lower than average, the winds along its southern edge—our old friends the trades—weaken. The North Pacific Oscillation is first and foremost an atmospheric pattern. North Pacific Oscillation pattern in sea level pressure. Green solid lines show higher-than-average sea level pressure; dotted green lines show lower-than-average sea level pressure. Figure by climate.gov based on original by Kathy Pegion. The North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) doesn’t act alone. Other precursor patterns help link the weakening of the subtropical high to the slowing of the trade winds. You may remember your brief fling with the Pacific Meridional Mode (re-branded for our purposes here as the North Pacific Meridional Mode). This pattern shows up in the eastern Pacific as warmer-than-average surface water north of the equator and cooler-than-average water south of the equator. The weaker trades of the NPO encourage the warmer ocean surface on the north side of the equator, which in turn helps to reinforce the weakening of the trades. For more on this complicated dance, check out Dan Vimont’s guest post. The Victoria Mode and Trade Wind Charging also link the NPO to the equatorial region and thereby to ENSO development. The signature of the Victoria Mode is cooler-than-average surface water and related weaker trades in the western North Pacific (2). The cooler western Pacific signature of the Victoria Mode develops in tandem with the NPO circulation. “Trade Wind Charging” is the mechanism linking the changes in trade winds to increased subsurface water temperature. Its signature is reduced wind stress—the force on the surface that is caused by the wind—in the eastern Pacific, and increased wind stress in the western Pacific. The changes in wind stress are what help to kick off downwelling Kelvin waves, which increase the subsurface temperature. This source of warmer water is necessary for a developing El Niño. Not directly related to the NPO is the Western North Pacific pattern. The signature of this pattern is cooler-than-average water off the coast of China and warmer water in the central equatorial Pacific in the winter. This leads to slower trades and lower wind stress on the surface of the western equatorial Pacific, inducing downwelling Kelvin waves and increasing subsurface heat content. Research has found this pattern can precede the development of El Niño by a full year. Western North Pacific pattern. Shaded colors show sea surface temperature (reds = warmer than average, blues = cooler) and arrows show wind direction. Figure by climate.gov based on original by Kathy Pegion. In the Southern Hemisphere, we have the South Pacific Oscillation and the South Pacific Meridional Mode. (Hey, we can’t all have catchy names like The Blob.) Whereas the northern precursors I described above are most useful during December–February, the southern ones are most active during June–August, winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Like its North Pacific counterpart, the South Pacific Oscillation is a change in sea level pressure, leading to a reduction in the trade winds. And, also like its northern sibling, the South Pacific Meridional Mode appears as warmer-than-average water to the south of the equator, and helps to link the trade wind changes of the South Pacific Oscillation to the equatorial winds. For in-depth coverage of the southern modes (as well as a successful forecast!), head to Jason Furtado’s guest post. South Pacific Oscillation. Green lines show sea level pressure (solid = stronger than average, dotted = weaker). Figure by climate.gov based on original by Kathy Pegion. In case you can’t tell from the maps, all these patterns overlap and influence each other, as well as providing clues to the development of ENSO. Also, some have alternate names, or have been identified differently by different researchers, and I’m sure if I were to write this post ten years into the future it would be a different animal. Regardless, now you have an idea of some of the many patterns forecasters keep an eye on when on safari developing outlooks for ENSO.

In fact, the 3-month-average (the Oceanic Niño Index) in October–December was 0.46°C above normal, which rounds to 0.5°C. “Hey!” you say. “Isn’t that the El Niño threshold?” Indeed it is, but of course El Niño requires more than a couple months of above-average sea surface temperature.

The current CPC/IRI ENSO forecast estimates about a 60% chance that ENSO-neutral conditions will remain through the summer. Chances for the fall and winter are about equally split between neutral continuing and La Niña developing, at around 45% each. El Niño isn’t completely ruled out, but it is less likely, with a chance of about 10%. June finds us starting to emerge from the spring predictability barrier, when computer models are less successful at predicting how ENSO will behave.

    "content": "ENSO is still in neutral, and likely to continue so through the summer. However, the 50-55% chance of La Niña developing in the fall and lasting through winter means NOAA has hoisted a La Niña Watch. I’ve been writing these blog posts for more than six years now, and the terminology La Niña Watch still makes me picture someone peering out their window, binoculars trained on the horizon, waiting for La Niña to pop up. That wouldn’t be a great use of your time, though, as a Watch means the forecast favors the development of La Niña conditions within the next six months. (Also, of course, La Niña—just like El Niño—is a seasonal ocean/atmosphere pattern that develops in the tropical Pacific Ocean, so it might be tough to see it from your window!) The point of a La Niña Watch is to give planners for energy, agriculture, disaster management, and other sectors a heads-up that the chance of La Niña developing is greater than the combined chance of neutral and El Niño. La Niña changes global atmospheric circulation and influences global weather and climate, so if La Niña develops, seasonal average temperature and rainfall patterns may be more predictable. The current forecast, a 50-55% chance of La Niña, is not a very strong probability. There is still about a 40-45% chance that neutral conditions will remain through the fall and winter, and a smaller but non-zero chance of El Niño—around 5-10%. The official CPC/IRI ENSO probability forecast, based on a consensus of CPC and IRI forecasters. It is updated during the first half of the month, in association with the official CPC/IRI ENSO Diagnostic Discussion. It is based on observational and predictive information from early in the month and from the previous month. Image from IRI. These probabilities reflect forecasters’ thinking about current conditions in the tropical Pacific and the computer model guidance. For the past few months, many of the dynamical computer models have been pointing to cooler-than-average conditions on the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These models start from observed ocean and atmosphere conditions and apply physical equations to create a picture of potential future conditions. We consider many different models, and run them many times, to generate a range of potential outcomes that is as complete as possible. Right now, most of these models predict that sea surface temperatures in the Niño3.4 region will be more than 0.5°C cooler than the long-term average—the La Niña threshold—in the fall and winter, although there is still a wide range of potential outcomes. Climate model forecasts for the Niño3.4 Index. Dynamical model data (black line) from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME): darker gray envelope shows the range of 68% of all model forecasts; lighter gray shows the range of 95% of all model forecasts.  image from CPC data. We’re finally past the spring predictability barrier, a time of year when climate models are less successful at predicting how the surface temperature of the Pacific will evolve. Forecasts made in July have a good track record of predicting the Niño3.4 index in the late fall and winter, so forecasters increasingly put more weight on them. Of course, forecasters also look at the current ocean and atmosphere conditions in the tropical Pacific for signs of how ENSO will develop. Sea surface temperature anomalies (anomaly = difference from the long-term average) in the east-central Pacific, which were slightly positive through much of the winter and spring, are currently slightly negative.

Patio furniture is flying off store shelves, gardens are springing to life, and outdoor BBQs are becoming the socially distant events of the season. But as we look to the outdoors in our quest for a bit of normalcy, it is important to remember that basking in the sunshine comes with its own health risks from the Sun’s ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Oh great, something else to worry about. But before you decide it’s safer to permanently relocate under your bed, avoiding the harmful UV effects is relatively easy. All we need is a little understanding of UV radiation, a forecast of UV intensity and some basic guidelines. Morning at the beach in the Outer Banks. If you want to spend the day at the beach, there are plenty of ways to protect your skin from the UV radiation including sunscreen, hats, clothing as well as beach umbrellas and canopies to shield you from the midday sun when the sun’s rays are most intense. Photo taken by Laura Ciasto. The sun produces a lot of energy in many different forms. Some energy we can see (visible light), and some, like UV radiation, we can’t see but our skin absorbs it, especially on sunny summer days. The sun’s UV radiation is divided into three components based on how energetic it is. UV-C is the most energetic, and therefore the most harmful. Fortunately, the ozone layer—Earth’s giant sun umbrella—completely…absorbs it (phew!). The ozone layer also absorbs most UV-B radiation, but some still reaches us, causing those sunburns that have fair-skinned people slathering on aloe and wishing they’d lathered on more sunscreen. The final type of ultraviolet light is UV-A, the least energetic and least harmful of the three, most of which makes it through the ozone layer. Ozone in the stratosphere provides protection from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The ozone layer is mostly transparent to incoming visible light and longer-wavelength UV, but it absorbs a large amount of damaging UV-B.

Flour and yeast also would be pretty boring and inert on their own, but when put together, they reinforce each other, the combined product increases in size, and eventually it releases the heavenly scents of fresh baked bread. That’s right, I’m basically saying ENSO is fresh baked bread (Mmm, ENSO, you’re so tasty). But how do the ocean and atmosphere come together to make the bread ENSO?

(1) This year is a bit different from some of my recent winter outlook posts because there’s no need to wait around to see if either El Niño or La Niña will develop in time to impact winter. Instead, the tropical Pacific is already taking center stage, and it doesn’t want to give up the spotlight any time soon. La Niña developed during late summer and has strengthened, leaving virtually no doubt that it will persist through the winter. So, what does that mean for temperature and precipitation across the United States over the next 3 months? As long-time readers of this blog should know, La Niña (as well as El Niño) often exerts a significant influence on winter climate over North America. This influence means that the U.S. temperature and precipitation patterns for the winter season tend to be more predictable than usual in some regions, as these patterns share many features during most episodes. For instance, most of the 20 strongest La Niña events of the past 70 years have seen drier-than-average conditions across much of the southern tier of the U. S., particularly along the Gulf Coast.

Our posts about North American impacts are too many to list—check out the index page to see some of those. We’ve even visited the Arctic! Today, we’ll add the fifth-largest continent, a vast, ice-covered disc at the bottom of the world, surrounded by a roaring ocean. Antarctica is about as close to being on another planet as you can get while still on Earth. Its 5.5 million square miles have been covered in ice for 35 million years, the average summer (December–February) temperature at the south pole is -18°F, and the ice sheet covering the land averages 1 mile thick and contains over 70% of the world’s fresh water. Antarctica is entirely surrounded by the Southern Ocean, which allows the west-to-east winds to tear along unimpeded, whipping up tremendous waves and storms. Geographers divide Antarctica into three regions: East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Transantarctic Mountains separate the eastern and western parts of the continent. Ice shelves fringe the continent, the two largest being the Ronne and the Ross. Among the nearby seas are the Amundsen, Bellinghausen, Davis, Ross, and Weddell, and Antarctica is surrounded by the vast Southern Ocean. The continent is surrounded by seasonally varying sea ice. Sea ice extent can reach 7 million square miles at the maximum in September, shrinking to around 1 million square miles in February or March. Along the edge of the continent, numerous glacier-fed ice shelves are grounded below sea level, with floating tongues that reach out as far as the balance between gravity and buoyancy allows. When the balance fails, portions of the shelf break off into icebergs, a natural process known as calving. In recent decades, some shelves have disintegrated rapidly. These processes don’t directly contribute to sea level since the ice was already floating in the ocean. But grounded ice shelves slow down the free flow of interior glaciers into the ocean, keeping their glacial contribution to sea level rise in check. Also, grounded ice can contribute to sea level rise when it is melted by warmer ocean water from below. For more detail on ice shelves and glacial acceleration, check out this great climate.gov overview of Antarctic ice. Glacier-fed ice shelves are complex systems affected by multiple factors: gravity pulling on the glacier, water buoying the ice shelf, air and water temperatures, winds, storms, snow accumulation and so on. Atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns can drive these events, and ice shelf responses can change the outcome. This schematic of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica shows some of the processes affecting glacier flow and ice shelf calving. Image from Scambos et al.",

In this post, we’ll investigate what was going on for the first two-thirds of this winter. As Emily mentioned back in January, the early winter temperature pattern over North America looked more like a typical El Niño than what we would expect from a moderate-to-strong La Niña. This unexpected temperature pattern resulted from shifts in the jet stream that we usually don’t see during La Niña.

This website, which you can access at https://climexp.knmi.nl/, is a great way to plot and play with climate data. Give it a whirl! Geert Jan isn’t just a talented web programmer and data manager—he is also a prolific climate scientist who has been working with me and several of our colleagues on a matter of increasing importance. Our collaborators include the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia (BOM), European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and the international Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. Global warming has become increasingly prominent in our ocean temperature datasets. It is difficult to look at a map of sea surface temperature (SST) across the globe and not see that global maps are often awash in red color, reflecting above-average temperatures. This includes the tropical Pacific Ocean, where differences from average sea surface temperature (or SST anomalies) are the key ocean indicator for El Niño (warmer) and La Niña (cooler). At the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, these tropical Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies are tracked using the Niño-3.4 index (or the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), which is the seasonal average of Niño-3.4). This index, or time series of ENSO variability, is used as an early warming indicator for El Niño and La Niña- related climate disruptions that might require humanitarian aid. They realized that the presence of global warming in SST-based ENSO index may be resulting in over or under-preparation for unusual rainy seasons (you can read more about this in Geert Jan’s open-access article). For monitoring ENSO, everything depends on how conditions compare to average. But what does “above average” temperatures actually mean?

During much of the year, the prevailing wind over northwestern Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico is westerly (blowing from the west) and dry. (Going forward, to avoid having to say “northwestern Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico” over and over, I’ll refer to this area as “the monsoon region.”) As the summer heat builds over North America, a region of high pressure forms over the U.S. Southwest, and the wind becomes more southerly, bringing moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California.

    "content": "When the climate doesn’t behave like we expect, whether it’s for an individual season or for several decades, we often hear scientists blaming internal variability. Scientists use this term a lot (even on Twitter) and I’ve noticed that I usually obtain a few blank faces depending on the audience. I also remember being a junior scientist in this field and wondering why everyone was going on about internal, or its counterpart, external variability. Internal/External what? And who cares? Me! And you should, too! In our climate and weather there are: (1) The things that are pushed around by other (external) things (2) The things that would change or move (internally) without any push You, yourself, have your own internal variability when it comes to your behavior! But, at times, there may also be an external forcing that causes you to deviate from what you’d otherwise do. For example, I really enjoy taking walks in the woods and try to do so whenever I can. Because there are lots of trail options where I’m walking, my path will change from day to day based on pure randomness or a need for variety. But I also really don’t like running into bears (especially fat bears). As much as I’d like to pretend they don’t exist, if I see a bear, I will strongly deviate from my intended path and choose one that gives the bear a wide berth. So bears are an external forcing on my walking path. Cartoon by Anna Eshelman Bears aside, why would we care whether variability is internal or external? Well, in the climate system, we might care a lot if we want to answer questions like “Is this rainstorm caused by El Niño?” Or “Did human-caused climate change cause the polar vortex to break down?” In order to figure out the answers, we first have to examine the likelihood that the impact would have occurred without any push from an external force. To phrase it another way, we need to determine whether the rainstorm may have occurred without any influence from El Niño. Or whether that change in the polar vortex would have occurred without increasing greenhouse gases. Internal variability are changes that would have happened anyways, regardless of the presence of something else (footnote #1). There will always be some day-to-day variations in my walks even if every bear instantly disappeared. For a scientist, it can be difficult to prove whether a weather or climate event occurred due to some external influence, like increasing greenhouse gases. This is because the observed weather—our reality—only occurs once! We can’t run an alternate reality where we remove the external influence because our observations are already history. This is where a reliable climate model that simulates realistic weather and climate comes in handy. In model world, we can run an experiment that does not have the external forcing—for example, an atmosphere with no increases in greenhouse gases—and a second experiment that DOES have the external influence of greenhouse gases. The difference between the results is considered the part that is externally influenced by greenhouse gases. Going back to my walks, we can compare my path through the woods in a world with bears to my path in a world without bears. But there’s a catch (there’s always a catch, darn it): the butterfly effect. Just like my different paths through the woods on different days, climate model simulations will evolve differently from each other based on small differences in their starting state. This is true in a world with bears (excess greenhouse gases) and without them. That’s why scientists prefer model studies that run “large ensembles.” These generate dozens—sometimes hundreds—of my simulated walks in the woods with bears versus dozens of simulated walks without bears. Cartoon by Anna Eshelman Running a bunch of simulations results in a range of possible outcomes with bears (my random variability plus external forcing) and a range of outcomes without bears (only my random variability; no external forcing). We can compare these two ranges to get an idea of how much the odds of my following a given path (climate outcome) have changed. To build even more confidence, it is ideal to compare large ensembles among several different models. Dr. Clara Deser, a senior scientist at NCAR, has been at the forefront of large ensemble studies, and she recently wrote a commentary on internal climate variability, which you should check out. In that piece, she provided an example of how external and internal variability can influence the trends in winter precipitation across the U.S. that we may experience over the next 50 years.

Get your popcorn and settle down on the couch—it’s time for this month’s ENSO cinema. A recurring theme here at the ENSO Blog is the on-again, off-again relationship between the tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere. ENSO (short for El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the entire El Niño–La Niña system) relies on the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere. Average conditions in the tropical Pacific (see the drawing below) consist of relatively warmer surface water in the west and relatively cooler surface in the east. Air rises over the warm western water, forming clouds and rain; winds blow west-to-east high up in the atmosphere; air descends over the cooler east; winds blow east-to-west near the surface. Dun-dun-dunnn… it’s the Walker circulation! ENSO-Neutral or average conditions across the tropical Pacific Ocean. Climate.gov schematic by Emily Eng and inspired by NOAA PMEL. When La Niña is present, the atmosphere takes one look at that characteristic cooler-than-average central/eastern Pacific ocean surface and gets all amped up. I haven’t yet seen the Walker circulation standing outside La Niña’s house holding a boombox aloft, but ENSO is always full of surprises. During La Niña, the surface trade winds (small gray arrows) blow more strongly than normal, piling up warm surface water in the western Pacific and drawing up deep, cool water in the eastern Pacific. Over the warm waters, the air becomes more buoyant (upward thick arrow), and rainfall increases. Over the cool waters, it is less buoyant, favoring subsidence (downward gray arrow) and less rainfall. These feedbacks between ocean and atmosphere strengthen the La Niña event. Climate.gov schematic by Emily Eng and inspired by NOAA PMEL. The resulting stronger near-surface winds (the trade winds) reinforce the cooler ocean surface—the feedback mechanism fundamental to ENSO. For more on how this works, and a delectable bread analogy, check out Michelle’s Oscar-winning post. All this is to say that La Niña conditions, after developing in September, continued in October. The surface of the ocean in the Niño-3.4 region, our primary ENSO-monitoring region, was about 1.0˚ C (1.8˚ F) cooler than the long-term average, via the ERSSTv5, our primary ENSO-monitoring dataset.

    "date": null,
    "content": "This is a guest blog by Michael Tippett (professor at Columbia University) and Tim DelSole (professor at George Mason University), adapted from material in their new text book Statistical Methods for Climate Scientists. Predictability is a word that often comes up in discussions here on the ENSO Blog (another is variability). Let’s see if we can understand what climate scientists mean by predictability without having to read an entire book on statistics! As you might guess, climate scientists use the word predictability a little differently than the rest of the world. For instance, you might say that I am predictable because I take the same path each day on my morning walk, with small variations. On the other hand, for a climate scientist concerned with predictability, the question is whether it’s possible to forecast how my walk tomorrow will differ from its usual path (footnote #1). Predicting that I’ll take my usual path is a climatological forecast in the sense that it is based only on the long-term average (climate) of past events. For a climate scientist, predictability is all about how forecasts differ from the climatological forecast. In fact, if the climatological forecast of an event is the only forecast available, the climate scientist will say that the event is unpredictable. So, my morning walk could be predictable to you but unpredictable to a climate scientist. (left) If the only forecast we can make for a hiker's path through the woods on a given day is that it will be similar to the long-term average, we call that outcome unpredictable. (right) If we can forecast occasions when a hiker's path will deviate from the climatological path, we say the future path has some level of predictability.  cartoon. Note that, according to the climate scientist, forecasts of the sun rising tomorrow, nighttime being dark, winter being colder than summer, etc., get no credit in terms of predictability because they are climatological forecasts. Let’s consider an example of predictability we can agree on. I would say the outcome of a coin toss is unpredictable, assuming a fair coin, and no funny business on the part of the person tossing the coin. Why do I say it is unpredictable? Is it because the outcome is random and cannot be predicted? No, I can make a forecast of 50% chance of heads, and that is a perfectly fine (footnote #2a) and reliable forecast (footnote #2b). Is it because that forecast uses probabilities? Also no—weather and climate forecasts often use probabilities. The reason I say the coin toss is unpredictable is because the 50/50 forecast is a climatological forecast. It does not tell us anything about this coin toss that is different from any other coin toss. In fact, a tell-tale sign for unpredictability is if our 50/50 forecast doesn’t change from one coin toss to another. How can the coin toss help us to understand anything about the unpredictability of weather? Imagine I’m planning a 4th of July picnic, and I want to know whether or not it will rain here in Nyack, NY. Is that something that I can predict now in April? I’d say no. It’s unpredictable—the chaotic nature of the atmosphere means making a precise weather forecast two months ahead of time is essentially impossible. However, I do know that rain has been observed on 33% of past July 4ths during the period",

(Seriously, check out this index page covering all the ENSO blog posts to date.) But there is more to ENSO than physics and humans! Blasphemy, I know.

And luckily for you, reader, the long answer involves this Q&A with ENSO expert Dr. Nate Mantua on all things ENSO + Salmon. Introducing Dr. Nate Mantua of NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center where he is a climate scientist…no wait, he’s a marine biologist…no wait, he’s a …you know what, let’s ask Nate himself. Welcome Nate! First question: I get this question a lot. My research often spans many disciplines, and I recall one senior scientist labeling me as a “boundary spanner.” My two university degrees are in Atmospheric Sciences, and I have spent my post-graduate career learning about the ways that the atmosphere, ocean, watersheds, cryosphere and biosphere interact. Salmon are my favorite research topic and a lifelong passion of mine, and they are among nature’s greatest boundary crossers for the way they live. Different migration patterns of specific populations of salmon across the West Coast from California to Alaska.  image adapted from NOAA Fisheries data. First off, salmon are coldwater fish. In North America, Pacific salmon range from Baja California to Alaska’s Arctic rivers. They thrive in the subarctic waters of the North Pacific where the water is cold (below 14 °Celsius, or about 57 °Fahrenheit), and the food-web is productive. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they spawn and rear in freshwater but migrate to the ocean where they can grow more quickly and reach bigger sizes than in most freshwater habitats. The basic lifecycle of salmon includes adults spawning, eggs incubating, and juveniles rearing for some period of time in freshwater streams or lakes. Life cycles of salmon from eggs to spawning adults. Click on image to see version with additional text. NOAA Fisheries image with illustrations done by Blane Bellerud People and salmon around the North Pacific Rim have a long history of connection and interdependence. In recent decades, many of those relationships have broken down where freshwater and estuary habitats for salmon have been transformed or blocked by land and water uses for other purposes. Salmon populations have plummeted throughout much of their historic range, and some populations have gone extinct. Many salmon fisheries have gone away or are now sharply limited as a consequence of the loss of abundant salmon populations. Where salmon remain abundant, they are a keystone species for the ecosystems they are part of. Productive salmon populations continue to support subsistence, sport and commercial fisheries, and salmon-based cultures. Visit the Pacific Northwest and you will see salmon imagery everywhere you look. The writer Timothy Egan said it best in his terrific book, The Good Rain, that “the Pacific Northwest is simply this: anywhere (Pacific) salmon can get to.” Difference from average air pressure and wind direction for all winters (December–February) with a moderate or strong La Niña (left) or El Niño (right). Moderate and strong are defined by anomalies of at least 1 degree Celsius in the Niño 3.4 region (NOAA's Oceanic Niño Index). The 500-millibar geopotential height is the height above Earth's surface where the air has thinned enough that the pressure has decreased to 500 millibars. (At the surface, it's a little over 1,000 millibars on average). Higher than average heights (orange) mean higher pressure than average; lower heights (purple) mean lower pressure than average.  images based on data provided by NOAA Physical Science Laboratory. ENSO’s impacts on North Pacific climate and the northeast Pacific Ocean primarily affect salmon by changing the quality and quantity of the cold-water habitats and aquatic food-webs that salmon thrive in. More snowmelt and rain-fed runoff improves the freshwater habitat, while less decreases the habitat. Since El Niño favors a warmer and drier winter in the Pacific Northwest along with a warmer ocean near the coast, it is usually bad news for West Coast salmon. Following an El Niño winter, there is typically a smaller snowpack and less cold water flowing into the watersheds, which leads to a degradation in the freshwater habitat. But that same El Niño winter typically brings a milder and wetter winter with more snowmelt and rain-fed runoff to coastal Alaska, and that is usually a good thing for Alaska’s salmon (it is already plenty cold for Alaska salmon in an average year). La Niña intensifies the average atmospheric circulation—surface and high-altitude winds, rainfall, pressure patterns—in the tropical Pacific. Over the contiguous United States, the average location of the jet stream shifts northward. The southern tier of the country is often drier and warmer than average.  illustration. Following a La Niña winter, though, salmon in the Columbia River Basin across much of the Pacific Northwest usually get a boost in stream flows (from both rain-fed and snow-fed runoff), resulting in more and colder freshwater habitat. On the other hand, La Niña typically brings a colder, drier winter with less snowmelt runoff to coastal Alaska, which reduces stream flows and shortens to already brief growing season (because it is already cold in Alaska) in its freshwater salmon habitat. For northern California (where most of its salmon rivers are located), cooler and wetter winter/spring conditions are typically the best for California salmon.

La Niña is present when the sea surface temperature in the east-central Pacific Ocean is at least 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) cooler than the long-term average, along with evidence of a stronger atmospheric circulation above the equatorial Pacific. In July, the sea surface temperature in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific, our primary monitoring region, was 0.7 °C cooler than average (average =",

And maybe my job will be pretty easy this time, given that we are expecting a third consecutive winter with La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific. What will that mean for this winter? Let’s find out! Winter Outlook enthusiasts are likely aware of how much the occurrence of La Niña (as well as El Niño) can shape the outlook, and for good reason: ENSO, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (the entire El Niño and La Niña system), exerts a significant influence on winter climate over North America.

    "content": "As our regular readers will be very aware, La Niña has been rolling along in the tropical Pacific for many months, and our third La Niña winter in a row is under way. La Niña is the cool phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (“ENSO” for short) climate pattern. The current forecast is for La Niña to continue into the winter, with 50-50 chances for La Niña and neutral in the January–March average. Conditions in the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system have been consistent with La Niña for long enough that, in November, one of our frequent readers commented—accurately—that they might as well have just re-read the October post! However, while La Niña seems stuck in a rut right now, the last thing we want is to give the impression that ENSO is boring! So this month, I’ll do a quick recap of current conditions before looking into a question I’ve been curious about for a while now: how does ENSO affect daily temperatures during winter? The sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific is still well within La Niña territory, at about 0.9 °C cooler than the long-term average in November, according to ERSSTv5, our favorite sea surface temperature dataset. This anomaly—the difference from the long-term average—has been gradually warming up over the past few months, since reaching -1.1 °C in September. Three-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for the 8 existing double-dip La Niña events (gray lines) and the current event (purple line). Of all the previous 7 events, 2 went on to La Niña in their third year (below the blue dashed line), 2 went on to be at or near El Niño levels (above the red dashed line) and three were neutral. Graph by Emily Becker based on monthly Niño-3.4 index data from CPC using ERSSTv5. The atmosphere also continues to reflect La Niña’s amped-up Walker circulation, with more rain than average over Indonesia, drier-than-average conditions over the central Pacific, and stronger winds, both near-surface and high in the atmosphere, all observed during November. The near-surface winds—the east-to-west trade winds—fluctuated a bit, slowing a little in mid-November. Since these winds cause upwelling, their slow-down may have contributed to the slight weakening in the sea surface temperature anomaly. Forecasters are very confident that La Niña will continue in the short term, followed by a transition to neutral conditions. The exact timing of the transition is not clear, with equal chances of both La Niña and neutral for the January–March average. Confidence that La Niña will have exited by the February–April period, however, is fairly high, with a 71% chance of neutral. This forecast indicates that we can expect La Niña to influence our winter climate conditions this year. Check out the September post for a round-up of La Niña’s typical effects on winter temperature, rain and snow, and other weather and climate. During La Niña, the Pacific jet stream often meanders high into the North Pacific. Southern and interior Alaska and the Pacific Northwest tend to be cooler and wetter than average, and the southern tier of U.S. states—from California to the Carolinas—tends to be warmer and drier than average. Farther north, the Ohio and Upper Mississippi River Valleys may be wetter than usual. Climate.gov image. When we talk about the expected La Niña influence on seasonal temperature, we almost always talk about how the seasonal average is shifted during ENSO events. For example, during La Niña, winter in the northern U.S. tends to be cooler than average. The seasonal average temperature is very important, with implications for the amount of energy used for heating, and so on. Also, looking at seasonal averages means that we are filtering out short-term fluctuations and can be more confident that the shifts in climate are truly linked to ENSO. However, you and I generally experience weather from a day-to-day perspective. We’ll notice big shifts in temperature from one day to the next, or unusually warm or cold days. To get an idea of how ENSO affects daily temperatures, I’ll start by looking at the range of daily average temperature within each winter. How much does the temperature normally vary from day to day? Then we can ask, for example, do La Niña winters have a wider range of daily temperatures in some locations than average? Narrower? No change? This is just a starting place, but we have to start somewhere! The footnote has details about the calculations and data I used for the maps I show below. Also, I’m far from the first person to look at ENSO’s impact on daily characteristics of temperature, of course, and the footnote includes some information on earlier studies. The standard deviation is a common statistic to understand the spread of a set of numbers. For example, if most of your daily winter temperatures occur in the range of 40–50 °F, the standard deviation will be smaller than if most of your daily temperatures are in the range of 35–55 °F, even though the average temperature may be the same at both locations. This statistic is widely employed in weather and climate science, and it’s what I use here. The average variability of daily temperatures within winter. Yellow regions show where the range of daily temperatures in winter is greatest, while blue shows regions with the narrowest range. The range is assessed using the standard deviation of daily mean temperature averaged over all winters (December–February),",

It is very likely that the equatorial Pacific Ocean is going to warm up somewhere, but where exactly the strongest warming occurs is an important question. In particular, scientists want to know more about the geographic pattern of trends (2). By modifying the heating in the tropics, these changes will then have knock-on influences across the globe because, as we like to say, what happens in the Pacific does not stay in the Pacific! The trend pattern is critical to understanding how the average or background atmospheric circulation of the tropical Pacific will change. Remember: the background state of the atmosphere in the tropical Pacific—the Walker Circulation—is fueled by the difference in sea surface temperature between the west and the east. Sea surface temperatures in the Pacific around the equator are generally cooler in the East (blue colors) than they are in the West (yellow-orange).

I’m in an alliterative mood.) But first, my yearly warning that some math is involved in this post. Because while it may be easiest to just use our eyes to verify whether the forecast map matched the real winter, our eyes can lie. Plus, we aren’t looking for an easy way out. We’re the ENSO Blog, and you are ENSO Blog readers, for Pete’s sake! No one here is afraid of math, right?! And to properly put this year’s outlook into perspective, we need to use consistent statistical metrics. The good news is that I’ve already covered the complicated aspects of statistical verification in eight previous posts at the ENSO Blog. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Head there to nerd out. Still, I’ll repeat some basics: The winter outlooks for temperature and precipitation are for the probability that seasonal average temperatures and total precipitation will be either above average, below average, or near average. The Winter Outlook map we normally see is showing only the category that has the highest chance of the three. If all chances are the same (called “Equal Chances”), the location is colored in white (1). Note that the “highest” probabilities are never that high. In last winter’s outlook, the highest probability issued was 50-60%. There is simply too much uncertainty in seasonal predictions to warrant probabilities anywhere close to 100% in any of the three categories (2). It’s important to remind ourselves what these outlooks are actually predicting before we even begin to look into how they did. Let’s verify!

Today we’re hoisting an El Niño Watch, meaning that conditions are favorable for the development of El Niño conditions within the next 6 months. In fact, there’s a 62% chance of El Niño conditions for the May–July period. Read on for the reasoning behind the outlook, thoughts about the potential strength of El Niño, and implications for global weather and climate. The March average sea surface temperature in the Niño-3.4 region, our primary monitoring region for ENSO (El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the whole El Niño-La Niña system), was 0.2° Celsius (~0.4˚Fahrenheit) below the long-term average, according to ERSSTv5. This is solidly in the ENSO-neutral range, that is, between -0.5 and 0.5 °C difference from average. Three-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for the 8 existing multi-year La Niña events (gray lines) and the current event (purple line). Of all the previous 7 events, 2 went on to La Niña in their third year (below the blue dashed line), 2 went on to be at or near El Niño levels (above the red dashed line) and three were neutral. Graph by Emily Becker based on monthly Niño-3.4 index data from CPC using ERSSTv5. The atmosphere is also looking quite neutral, overall. In March, both the Southern Oscillation Index and the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index were close to zero. Both of these indexes measure the strength of the atmospheric component of ENSO, via the relative surface pressures in the western and central-eastern Pacific. Negative index values indicate the Walker circulation is weaker than average, an El Niño response, while positive values tells us the west-east pressure difference is greater than average, indicating a strengthened Walker circulation—a La Niña response. Near-zero, like the current values, tells us that the atmospheric patterns are near average over the tropical Pacific Ocean. That’s where we are… but where are we going?? There’s a 62% chance that El Niño will develop during the May–July period, and more than 80% chance of El Niño by the fall. NOAA Climate Prediction Center forecast for each of the three possible ENSO categories for the next 8 overlapping 3-month seasons. Blue bars show the chances of La Niña, gray bars the chances for neutral, and red bars the chances for El Niño. Graph by Michelle L'Heureux. We spend a lot of time and effort monitoring and predicting ENSO because it can give us an idea about upcoming potential weather and climate conditions (and because it is a fascinating natural system!). When El Niño or La Niña are holding court in the tropical Pacific, they can affect global temperature and rain/snow patterns in specific ways, with the strongest impacts during the winter. Since ENSO can be predicted months in advance, we can start playing the odds on what sort of climate patterns can be expected. There is a lot of variety, and no prediction is ever perfect! But it’s currently the best tool we have to anticipate upcoming seasonal conditions. I’ll get back to the potential impacts of El Niño in a minute—first, let’s discuss this confident forecast. Forecasts made during the spring are often less accurate than those made other times of the year. ENSO tends to change phase during the spring, and the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system can be more susceptible to smaller pushes like short-term weather variations, contributing to the “spring predictability barrier.” So it seems the forecasters are really feeling their oats this month, to be giving El Niño such relatively high odds. What’s behind this? First, the latest runs from our computer climate models are providing very high probabilities that El Niño will develop this year. When there is a lot of agreement among the models, we tend to give more credence to their predictions. For some examples, here’re Niño-3.4 forecasts from the European multi-model ensemble, Australia’s ACCESS-S2, and the North American Multi-Model Ensemble. But it’s not just model advice supporting the forecast. We always keep an eye on the temperature of the water under the surface of the tropical Pacific. After many months cooler than average, the amount of warmer subsurface water has increased over the past month as a downwelling Kelvin wave—an area of warmer water that sloshes from the west to the east beneath the surface—traverses the tropical Pacific. Water temperatures in the top 300 meters (1,000 feet) of the tropical Pacific Ocean compared to the",

Mike has previously blogged with us and was lead editor of the book “El Niño- Southern Oscillation in a Changing Climate” published by the American Geophysical Union. He has had a prolific career, including spearheading development of the Tropical Atmospheric Ocean (TAO) buoy array across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is key to observing and understanding ENSO. For more than 30 years, climate researchers have been puzzling about how human-forced climate change affects the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the warm phase of which we refer to as El Niño and the cold phase as La Niña. There are two aspects to this question: Arguably, we have made more progress on the second question than the first because greenhouse gas forcing in the future is expected to be stronger than it has been up to now; the stronger the forcing, the more obvious its impacts become. Whether climate change has already affected ENSO has been a harder nut to crack. A previous blog article by Tom DiLiberto summarized the conclusions from the latest IPCC report, which essentially found that there was no clear evidence yet for an impact of climate change on tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies related to ENSO. However, in a recent study published in Nature Reviews Earth and Environment, Wenju Cai and colleagues revisit this question, reviewing past studies and performing new analyses to provide additional insights on this important question. One of the primary sources of information we have for past ENSO behavior is the instrumental record of sea surface temperatures (SST) from the tropical Pacific. Many have noted that the most recent period of the observed SST record in key ENSO index regions, like Niño-3.4, exhibits higher-amplitude variability than the early part of the record. The most recent 50-60 years, for example, appears to be more energetic, with larger swings up and down, than the previous 50-60 years. Cai and colleagues make this point using several different data sources and methods—evidence that the pattern is real, not just a data quality problem due to the relative sparsity of data before",

    "date": null,
    "content": "A robust El Niño is developing in the tropical Pacific, and we’re looking ahead to potential impacts on winter weather and climate. For specifics on this upcoming winter, you’ll have to wait for next month, when NOAA CPC will release their winter outlook. Today, I’m going for the big picture—how does the temperature of the surface of the tropical Pacific, thousands of miles away, change rain, snow, and temperature patterns over North America? The short answer: by shifting the location and strength of the jet stream. Let’s back up a bit, though. Any time we talk about the jet stream, we first need to define what we’re talking about, before getting into changes in its behavior and how that leads to changes in weather and climate. And, before I get into the jet, one additional quick definition: weather vs. climate. Weather is the short-term conditions, lasting minutes to days, and highly variable. Climate is the average conditions over a longer period, such as a week, month, season, years, or longer. ENSO (El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the entire El Niño and La Niña system) is a seasonal climate pattern that lasts for several months in a row and affects winter climate—average rain/snow and temperature patterns over the course of the season—over North America and many other parts of the globe. The jet stream, a fast, narrow current of air flowing from west to east high up in the atmosphere, is the mechanism connecting ENSO to North American winter climate patterns. Although the jet itself is high up and can reach speeds over 200 mph, the lower edges can extend all the way to the surface, at much lower speeds. There are lots of jets in the atmosphere, but on the ENSO Blog, we often talk about the Pacific subtropical jet stream, which owes its existence to tropical heating and the rotation of the Earth. The sun heats the tropical land and oceans, causing lots of warm, moist air to rise. As that air gets high up in the atmosphere, it has to go somewhere, so it flows north and south. Eventually, it cools and sinks back to near the surface around 30 ° latitude in both hemispheres. From there, it flows back toward the equator. This loop is called the Hadley circulation. El Niño influences global atmospheric circulation by intensifying the Hadley circulation, in which heat is transferred from the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere through convection and latent heating. Map by . The subtropical jet forms near the northern edge of the Hadley cell, high up in the atmosphere. Let’s just talk about the Northern Hemisphere for the moment, for simplicity. Because the Earth is rotating from west to east, the path of a moving air parcel bends to the right (this Coriolis force is also why hurricanes and other storms rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere). Around 30° north and south of the equator, the Coriolis force is strong enough bend the air flow so it’s west-east. So, the air traveling northward in the Hadley cell gradually turns toward the east, speeding up as it goes. It speeds up for the same reason a spinning figure skater speeds up when they pull in their arms—the air is closer to the axis of rotation and must accelerate to maintain the same relative speed. Voila, the jet stream! Of course, this is Earth, so nothing ends up being quite as simple as all that—the jet certainly never flows in a straight west-to-east line, and it is stronger and weaker in various areas—but that’s the big picture of why the subtropical jet stream exists. (See footnote.) The jet stream is a dividing line between cold northern air and warmer tropical air, and a track for storms. It also transports a lot of air around, so if the jet changes position, regions of higher and lower air pressure also shift. So, if you move the average position of the jet, you move what regions end up warmer or cooler than average, and where the rain and snow end up falling. El Niño and La Niña, through their impact on the jet stream, thus impact temperature and rain/snow patterns. All righty, so how does ENSO change the jet? First, imagine the atmosphere is a large pond. There’s a fountain in this pond that creates a pattern of ripples and currents in the pond. If you move the fountain, you’re going to change the pattern of ripples and currents. In the case of the atmosphere, that fountain is the very strong rising air and storminess that sits over the very warm waters of the far western Pacific. Even though the sun heats the tropics evenly, the rotation of the Earth and the shape of the Pacific Ocean basin create this warm-west, cool-east pattern. This region of very strong rising air over the very warm water of the western Pacific results in a an amped-up north-south Hadley circulation. El Niño’s warmer-than-average surface water in the central/eastern Pacific shifts the “fountain” to the east. La Niña enhances the warm-west, cool-east surface temperature pattern and further strengthens the rising air over far western Pacific—so the fountain is located in the same place, but is stronger. Three phases of the tropical Pacific atmospheric circulation pattern: El Niño, La Niña, and neutral. During El Niño, the engine driving tropical circulation shifts to the east, while during La Niña, it's stronger than average. Figure by climate.gov. In the case of El Niño, the strongest parts of the jet tends to shift southward and extend farther eastward across the North Pacific Ocean, reaching closer to North America and steering storms across the southern third of North America.

We plan to explore various facets of the winds, climate, and chemistry within the fascinating region of the atmosphere known as the polar stratosphere, and explain how this region can sometimes drive big changes in our weather patterns! While ENSO may be the seasoned celebrity in the seasonal forecasting world, in recent years the stratospheric polar vortex has become a rising star: constantly making headlines and being stalked by the paparazzi, but often misunderstood or misrepresented. We hope to clear up misconceptions, highlight new research, and discuss what the polar vortex is up to and how it may affect our winter’s weather. We expect there to be 1-2 posts per month between December and March, with the initial focus on the Northern Hemisphere polar vortex (yep, there’s one down south, too!). While we [Amy & Laura] are the lead editors of the blog, we hope to have guest contributors who can share their own perspectives and research on the polar vortex and related topics. And of course, this blog will not succeed without active engagement from you, our readers. We are happy to hear your constructive feedback and suggestions, and are excited to engage with you on this topic! After reading this introduction, the first question you might have is likely: What is the polar vortex? And so, that’s where we’ll begin!! In recent years, most people have heard the phrase “the polar vortex”, which has made regular appearances in media headlines, often with an exciting, albeit sometimes ominous “Day after Tomorrow”, flavor: But the “polar vortex” is not actually a synonym for “cold snap”; rather, it’s a well-known feature of Earth’s atmosphere that describes the high-altitude winds that blow around the pole every winter, miles above us in a region called the stratosphere. The polar vortex is in the polar stratosphere, above the layer of the atmosphere (the troposphere) where most weather, including the jet stream, occurs.  graphic. The stratospheric polar vortex forms in the winter hemisphere when the Earth’s pole is pointed away from the sun. The polar stratosphere enters darkness and becomes cold relative to the tropical stratosphere [footnote 1]. The temperature contrast makes for strong winds in the stratosphere that blow from west to east. This wintertime stratospheric wind is what we call the Arctic polar vortex [footnote 2]. If we were at a dance party, your first impression might be that the stratospheric polar vortex is the wallflower standing alone on the upstairs balcony, while the tropospheric jet stream is showing off on the dance floor with its flamboyant troughs, ridges, and cut-off lows. But as is so often true, first impressions are not always correct: while the polar vortex often doesn’t mind doing its own thing, it is not a passive watcher of the atmospheric dance down below. With some encouragement, polar vortex can actually become one of the most dynamic dancers there. Why does the polar vortex matter to us, given it is so high and far away in the polar atmosphere? That’s one of the things we hope to explore in much more detail on this blog. But one of the main reasons is because the vortex does not always sit quietly by itself. Though it might (literally) need a little push from the troposphere to get its groove on, it can really break down with a move called a “sudden stratospheric warming”. In this move, the polar vortex may wobble, swing far from its normal position over the pole, or stretch itself way out, sometimes even splitting in two (doing the “splits”? We can hear the groans from here…). And when this happens, the chances of cold weather across many populated regions can increase for many weeks afterwards. When the Arctic polar vortex is especially strong and stable (left globe), it encourages the polar jet stream, down in the troposphere, to shift northward. The coldest polar air stays in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens, shifts, or splits (right globe), the polar jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.  graphic, adapted from original by NOAA.gov. Alternatively, sometimes the vortex does another extreme move where it becomes super fast and stable, encouraging the cold air at the surface to stay over the pole, which increases the chances of winter heat extremes in some regions. We will be getting into all the details of these events and their influence on our weather in future blog posts. It’s hard to not be fascinated by the strong silent type that suddenly wows you with its awesome dance moves, particularly when those moves can cause extreme weather impacts, so scientists and forecasters have increasingly appreciated the need to monitor what the polar vortex is doing. We usually start by looking at the zonal (east-west) winds at 60N (the latitudes near Anchorage, AK or Oslo, Norway) at around 19 miles (30 kilometers) in altitude, where the air is so thin that the pressure is only 10 millibars (10 hectoPascals). By looking at a time series of these zonal winds we can get an idea of whether the polar vortex is really strong and stable, or weakening and ready to bust into its sudden stratospheric warming moves.

    "content": "We threw plenty of information at you in our last post introducing the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex. So let’s take a step back and examine that information a little more closely. If the last post was the “meet cute” with the stratosphere, then this post is more like a first date, where we get to know the polar vortex and find out what it’s been up to lately. We’ll start by taking a closer look at the average behavior of the temperature and wind patterns across the polar stratosphere throughout the year. The first thing you might notice is that the winds change direction in the late summer and spring. Or that the temperatures are colder in the winter than in the summer. Similar to the seasons we experience here on the ground, the stratosphere also has seasons. The seasonal cycle of polar vortex temperatures (background maps) and winds (white arrows).  animation, based on Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data provided by Laura Ciasto. The polar vortex forms in late summer, when when the amount of sunlight reaching the pole begins to decrease. Because the North Pole, which is completely dark for several months in the winter, receives less of the Sun’s rays than the tropics, the polar stratosphere air becomes colder than the tropical stratosphere air. To eliminate that temperature difference, the warm tropical air flows north toward the cold polar air. Earth’s west-to-east rotation nudges the wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, and the winds become primarily westerly (air moves from west to east). These winds are associated with the strength of the polar vortex, and they are strong enough to act as a barrier between the midlatitude and polar air, reinforcing the cold stratospheric air within the vortex. The polar vortex sticks around throughout the winter until mid to late spring. By then, the North Pole is tilted toward the Sun enough that the temperature differences between the equator and pole weaken and then reverse as the polar stratosphere becomes warmer than the tropical stratosphere [footnote #1]. As a result, the westerly winds weaken, reverse direction, becoming slightly easterly. This reversal of the west-to-east winds every spring is referred to as the final stratospheric warming (we’ll cover this more in the spring). As we’ve said before, the stratosphere can act as an introvert of the climate system, often content to do its own thing, but that’s not to say it isn’t active. The polar vortex wobbles, changing its shape and/or location around the pole as winds become weaker or stronger and temperatures become warmer or colder relative to their averages. There have been times when the westerly winds have become twice as strong as the typical speeds. Other times, the vortex winds “break down” and reverse direction entirely (aka “sudden stratospheric warming”). However, not every weakening of the vortex or warming over the Arctic can be considered a so-called “major” warming event. Those typically happen once every year or two [footnote #2]. Wobbles in the polar vortex can be caused by atmospheric waves, which are similar to ocean waves with huge dips and ridges that span enormous distances across the atmosphere. These waves can be generated within the stratosphere itself but often it’s the troposphere communicating with the stratosphere via one of these upward moving waves. Like the ocean waves on a beach, these atmospheric waves can “crash” in the stratosphere and impact the polar vortex winds [footnote #3]. One way we look at whether the stratosphere and troposphere are communicating is through so-called “paint drip” plots [footnote #4], which shows the departures from average thickness (“anomalies”). These plots can indicate when changes in air thickness over the Arctic are confined to either the stratosphere or the troposphere alone, when changes are occurring at the same time, or when changes at one level appear to lead changes at another level. It’s important to note that these plots cannot definitely tell us whether the stratosphere is inviting the troposphere to chat or vice versa, but it does suggest coupling (or lack of). We’ll talk more about atmospheric waves and stratosphere-troposphere coupling in future posts, including how it’s related to tropospheric climate patterns.

    "content": "When we last wrote two weeks ago, the forecasts suggested that the stratospheric polar vortex would continue to weaken and warm into January. Though there were a few days around the end of December where forecasts moved closer to predicting a full reversal of the west-to-east winds at 60 degrees North* that comprise a major “sudden stratospheric warming”, the ingredients did not fully come together. Instead, in the last few days there was a minor warming of the vortex. Temperatures in the mid-stratosphere (~19 miles above the surface) rose about 30 degC (55 deg F!) during the 6-day period between December 30 and January 5th, and the winds at 60 degrees North slowed considerably but did not reverse. Observed and forecasted (NOAA GEFSv12) wind speed (top) and temperature (bottom) in the polar vortex compared to the natural range of variability (faint shading). For the GEFSv12 forecast issued on January 7, only a few model runs predict a reversal of the vortex winds (top, thin magenta lines), and the average of all the runs (thick magenta line) predicts wind speed and direction will be near normal. Individual forecasts for temperature (bottom graph, light red lines) average out to just below normal temperatures (thick pink line).  image, adapted form original by Laura Ciasto. So what happened? Though we certainly don’t have a definitive answer yet, we can start to understand possible reasons by delving into how the stratosphere and the troposphere come together to bake up these sudden warming events, using a few key ingredients. Yes, the atmosphere, like the ocean, has waves! [footnote 1] And waves are key to how the stratosphere and troposphere communicate. In the troposphere, planetary-scale atmospheric waves arise from air blowing over mountain ranges, temperature differences between the land and the ocean, and even from far away tropical thunderstorms that drive persistent wave patterns called teleconnections. If these waves sit in just the right place for long enough, they can grow and amplify enough in the vertical direction to reach the stratosphere, where the waves can break. This is analogous to how ocean waves break on a beach, but in the atmosphere, the waves instead break in the stratosphere which can slow the polar vortex winds. There are two types of persistent weather patterns that typically precede sudden warmings: either unusually low pressure over the Aleutian Islands and high pressure (or blocking) over the North Atlantic, or else simultaneous high-pressure/blocking over both the Aleutian and Ural regions. The location of these patterns are in just the right place to amplify existing non-moving (or “stationary”) wave patterns that form in response to mountain ranges and land-sea temperature contrasts, especially the largest atmospheric waves [footnote 2], helping them to reach the stratosphere.

But I have to remind myself that weather and climate are two very different things. It’s not easy! After all, our lived experience from day to day, what we see and feel, is the weather. It’s a bit harder to “feel” the climate, which is the average of weather over different spans of time (footnote #4). I don’t generally go on a stroll in the morning and think to myself, “I better bring a raincoat because today’s 1-month average sure feels wet.” But those averages are the climate! And so, to understand the climate, we have to examine longer time periods. If this is still a bit confusing, I’m going to try out an analogy. And if it is lousy, you can immediately close your browser window and we will forget this ever happened. In honor of the New Year, many of us make resolutions to improve ourselves over the coming year. A popular one is to become fitter, by eating more balanced meals and exercising. I’m in this category and in early January, I bought one of those 1-month reduced-price gym memberships because this is THE YEAR I will become fit enough to do a pull-up (footnote #5).

But didn’t we just have a sudden stratospheric warming event?? Read on to find out what’s in the stratosphere’s line-up and how this double header fits in with typical stratosphere behavior. The atmospheric players have been positioning themselves again for another polar vortex disruption. First up, the current stratospheric conditions are primed for tropospheric wave activity because the polar vortex has been stable and even a bit on the strong side since the end of January. Those strong, but not too strong, west-to-east winds are ideal for atmospheric planetary waves to slide from the troposphere into the stratosphere. This is well-timed as the tropospheric weather patterns, particularly low pressure over the North Pacific and the high pressure over the North Atlantic/Europe, are in a good position to hit amplified wave activity into the stratosphere. Finally, while the stratospheric polar vortex has been strong and stable, it’s likely to start weakening soon as wave activity within the stratosphere itself increases. Differences from average atmospheric thickness (standardized geopotential height anomalies) in the column of air over the Arctic from the troposphere to the stratosphere since early December",

The equator-to-pole temperature gradients that maintain the west-to-east flowing winds in the stratosphere will weaken, and the polar vortex winds will dissipate. They will be replaced by polar stratospheric winds that flow weakly east-to-west through summer until the vortex reforms [footnote 1]. The date in spring when this seasonal transition of the polar vortex winds occurs is called the “final stratospheric warming” (final warming here for shortsies).

As mentioned in the previous post, this breakdown of the polar vortex isn’t a shocking cliffhanger, but rather the final stratospheric warming that occurs every spring as a result of the sun “rising” over the North Pole. Probably the most noteworthy part of the final warming is that it happened later than normal (on average, it’s April 12).

First things first: our beloved editor, Rebecca Lindsey, has trained us all very well, including being sure to acquaint our newer readers with the fundamentals of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation climate pattern, or ENSO. ENSO has two opposite phases, La Niña and El Niño, which change the ocean and atmospheric circulation in the tropics. Those changes start in the Pacific Ocean and affect global climate in known ways. El Niño and La Niña can be predicted many months in advance, giving us an early picture of potential upcoming temperature, rain, and snow patterns. When neither El Niño nor La Niña are present and conditions are more normal across the tropical Pacific, well, that’s ENSO-neutral conditions. There was some discussion this week amongst our ENSO forecast team about whether El Niño, much weakened already early last month, is still present. El Niño is a coupled system, meaning the ocean and atmosphere both exhibit characteristic changes. The atmospheric half of El Niño is harder to detect this month; most of the standard equatorial Pacific atmospheric indicators (rain and clouds over the tropical Pacific, trade winds and upper-level winds) were pretty close to average. However, the April average sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific was still 0.8 °C above average according to the ERSSTv5 dataset (average =",

    "content": "This is a guest post by Matthew Rosencrans, who is the lead hurricane season forecaster at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center. Spring has turned to summer, which means that allergies have mostly let go of their hold over our collective sinuses (apologies to those still suffering), sunscreen lathering is again a daily ritual, and many people grab their chairs and blankets and head to the beach. However, this is also when trouble can start brewing in the tropics, and so at this same time every year, forecasters across NOAA (1) turn their attention to the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season. Each May, NOAA issues their Atlantic Hurricane Season Outlook for the number of tropical storms and hurricanes we can expect in the upcoming summer and fall. This year, NOAA predicts a very high likelihood (85% chance) of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season (2), with 17-25 named storms (average is 14), 8-13 hurricanes (average is 7), and 4-7 major hurricanes (average is 3) (3). Why is NOAA so confident that we will have an active Atlantic hurricane season? We’ll lay it all out for you here (spoiler alert: we wouldn’t neglect ENSO on the ENSO Blog!). The first critical piece in the hurricane forecast playground is, you guessed it, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). As discussed previously on the blog (see here and here), ENSO has a large influence on the number of tropical storms and hurricanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. The hurricane impacts of ENSO are like a seesaw between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, strengthening hurricane activity in one region while weakening it in the other. When El Niño is driving, it tends to suppress hurricane activity in the Atlantic while amping it up in the eastern Pacific. La Niña has the opposite effect, usually increasing activity in the Atlantic and decreasing it in the eastern Pacific. Typical influence of El Niño on Pacific and Atlantic seasonal hurricane activity. Map by , based on originals by Gerry Bell. With La Niña likely developing by the peak of this year’s hurricane season, let’s dig into La Niña’s influence a bit more. La Niña’s main influence on hurricanes is primarily through changes in how the tropical winds change in speed and direction from the surface up to about 7 miles above the ground. We call this change in wind with increasing height the vertical wind shear, and strong vertical wind shear can rip a developing hurricane apart, or even prevent it from forming. A mature La Niña can reduce the wind shear over the Atlantic Basin, primarily over the western half of the tropical Atlantic, which creates an environment more favorable for storms to form, organize, and become more intense. During a La Niña-influenced hurricane season, prevailing winds are weaker than average, especially the upper-level westerlies. Hurricanes experience less vertical wind shear.  diagram. How does La Niña alter the pattern of vertical wind shear across the tropics? As this blog has discussed before, La Niña enhances the Walker circulation, with more rising air and rainfall over the western Pacific and Indonesia and more sinking air with reduced rainfall across the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific. In the upper atmosphere, these conditions produce an amplified “trough” of low pressure over the subtropical eastern Pacific in the area to the north of the suppressed rainfall, and a downstream “ridge” of high pressure over the Caribbean Sea and western tropical Atlantic. Think of the ripple effect from a rock hitting the water and you can get the general idea. The number of Atlantic hurricanes and tropical/subtropical storms tends to increase under La Niña conditions but decrease under El Niño conditions. The bars present the average number Atlantic hurricanes and tropical/subtropical storms sorted by El Niño/La Niña status, as determined by the June-November Niño-3.4 sea surface temperature index values over the",

El Niño’s signature is warmer-than-average surface water in the eastern and central tropical Pacific, while La Niña is cooler than average.

    "content": "This is a guest post by Dr. Derek Lemoine, who is APS Professor of Economics at the University of Arizona’s Eller College of Management and a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Dr. Sarah Kapnick, currently the NOAA Chief Scientist, collaborated with Dr. Lemoine on NOAA CPO-funded research while at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. As regular readers of the ENSO blog know, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issues forecasts of the large-scale climate patterns that we may see many months later. But they may not know that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Outlook is but one of the seasonal climate outlooks that NOAA produces. Creating and disseminating these outlooks requires a large investment in monitoring and forecasting systems, scientists, forecasters, and, of course, climate.gov bloggers. Do these outlooks matter in the financial world? In a new paper published in Nature Communications, Dr. Sarah Kapnick and I (an atmospheric scientist and economist odd couple, in work done before she became NOAA Chief Scientist) show that they matter to investors in financial markets. And, importantly, some matter more than others. To test whether seasonal outlooks influence the market, we examined how the prices of options on stocks changed when a seasonal outlook was released. Why test option prices rather than stock prices? We have a clear prediction for how option prices should move on average when an outlook is released, whereas we lack this clear prediction for stock prices (footnote #1). An option gives you the right---but not the obligation---to either buy or sell a particular company’s stock at a predefined “strike” price by a predefined “expiration” date. Let’s imagine that you’ve bought an option to buy stock and the expiration date is upon you. Should you exercise the option? If the stock’s price is now above the strike price, then yes: you get to buy the stock cheaply and can, if you want, immediately sell it at the market price for a profit. If the stock’s price is below the strike price, then no: just buy the stock on the open market if you want it, since you would pay more than necessary by exercising the option. Earlier on, before the expiration date draws nigh, you have a lot of upside from holding the option because the actual stock price could end up way above your strike. And you have no corresponding downside because you can always walk away and let your option expire unexercised if the stock price ends up below your strike. Who doesn’t like upside risk when it’s not contaminated with downside risk? So, you like holding an option. Now consider how much you would pay to acquire it. You tend to be willing to pay more to buy an option when you are more uncertain about what the stock’s price on the expiration date will be, because you get more of that sweet upside risk still without bitter downside risk. Conversely, the more certain you are about the future price of the stock, the less you are willing to pay for the option. So, the current price of an option tells us how uncertain investors must be about the future stock price. This measure of uncertainty is called “implied volatility,” as it is implied by market data. All else equal, higher prices for options imply more expected volatility; lower prices imply less. This cartoon shows a case where the investor made a profit, but a different pathway is plausible as well. It is possible when the expiration date arrives, it turns out the investor paid too much for the option and the strike price is larger than the price of the fishing stock. In which case the investor may decide to not exercise the option. Cartoon Credit: Anna Eshelman, climate.gov. Our work shows that, on average, the implied volatility will fall when a seasonal outlook is released, but ONLY IF investors think that the seasonal outlook might say something relevant to the firm’s stock price (footnote #2). If investors think the seasonal outlook is either worthless as a forecast or irrelevant to a particular firm, then the firm’s stock and option prices will not be affected by the outlook. If they instead believe the outlook is both skillful and potentially relevant to that firm, then, before the outlook is released, the firm’s stock and option prices should reflect investors’ expectations of what the outlook will say. Once a relevant outlook is released, the firm’s stock and option prices change to reflect the new information in the outlook. A particular outlook could increase uncertainty about the company’s future stock price by forecasting an especially unpredictable climate. However, once we average over many outlook releases, uncertainty about the company’s future stock price (in the form of implied volatility) falls upon the release of outlooks, simply because investors are no longer uncertain about what an outlook will say once they have the outlook in hand. Imagine that you are investing in a fishing company whose profits are affected by the state of ENSO. Its stock price should already incorporate investors’ expectations about what NOAA’s upcoming ENSO Outlook will say. For instance, they may already think an El Niño is coming, based on past months’ outlooks. If you think that an upcoming monthly update is unlikely to have much new to say, then that upcoming monthly update does not make you willing to pay much more for an option on the firm’s stock. But what if, instead, you think that an upcoming monthly update could offer additional news about how strong that El Niño will be? The greater the potential for news that is relevant to the value of the fishing company, the more uncertain you are about what its stock price will be once the monthly update is released. You are then willing to pay more for an option to take advantage of uncertainty about the firm’s stock price induced by the ENSO Outlook. Once the seasonal outlook is released, uncertainty about the outlook’s contents vanishes. You may still be uncertain about what the seasonal climate will be, but you are no longer uncertain about what the outlook will say about it or how the outlook will affect the company’s stock price. If the outlook did not contain much new information about the coming El Niño, then you are now not willing to pay as much as before for the option on the fishing company. If other investors make similar assessments, the price of the option will fall. Our study tested whether the degree of uncertainty implied by option prices (“implied volatility” again!) did indeed fall on average when seasonal outlooks were released from",

And it seems like the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a climate pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean that can affect weather across the world, is no exception. The expected transition from ENSO-Neutral to La Niña continues to proceed slowly, as if the whole Pacific is stuck in a summer daze, moving as slow as molasses. According to the August ENSO outlook, ENSO-Neutral conditions remain across the Pacific, with La Niña favored to develop during Autumn (66% chance) before persisting through the Northern Hemisphere winter (74% chance during November-January). Out of the three climate possibilities—La Niña, El Niño, and neutral—forecasts say that neutral conditions are the most likely for the July-September season (tall gray bar above the JAS label, over 80 percent chance). By the September-November (SON) season, La Niña has the highest chance of occurring (blue bar, above 65 percent chance). NOAA Climate Prediction Center image. All that summer heat can make one forgetful so let’s go back over why we care so much about ENSO. First, a reminder that El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of ENSO. El Niño occurs when the water in the eastern and central tropical Pacific is warmer than average, while La Niña occurs when the water is cooler than average. That change in water temperature can jumble up the tropical atmosphere above it, causing a global cascade of atmospheric impacts. The end result is shifts in the jet stream and changes in weather patterns, often leading to wild weather including floods, droughts, and heatwaves. But unlike other climate phenomena which can be difficult to predict even two weeks prior, the phase of ENSO can be predicted many months in advance, giving communities worldwide vital time to prepare. ENSO-Neutral, meanwhile, simply reflects that ocean temperatures are near-average, with little unusual impacts on the atmosphere above it. The last month has seen near-average sea surface temperatures across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, so we are squarely ENSO-Neutral. The Niño-3.4 region of the Pacific, which is our primary monitoring region for ENSO, was 0.1°C warmer than the long-term average from",

Salient is a startup that utilizes advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop and provide accurate, reliable forecasts on the subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales. Additionally, Brian serves as a decision support specialist, helping clients to navigate uncertainty in the most effective manner possible. There are not too many things more frustrating in this world than unmet expectations. Your favorite basketball team has an estimated 79% chance of beating the upcoming opposition; yet, they lose, and you’re out $10 to your work betting pool. There was only a 15% chance of rain in the forecast one day before your friend's wedding, and it starts raining precisely 10 minutes before the outdoor ceremony is supposed to start. Or perhaps you’re in the ENSO betting market. Regular readers of the blog recognize that climate predictions are uncertain, including for the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which are expressed as probabilities (70% chance of El Niño coming) instead of forecasting a single black-and-white outcome (El Niño is coming). To make decisions in the face of uncertainty, we sometimes consciously, often automatically, use our best guess at how likely the various outcomes are and what our tolerance for risk in the given situation is. For all but a few of us (nerd alert!), this is done in a qualitative, intuitive fashion. The trouble is, humans aren’t very good at it. Most of us find it difficult to intuitively understand probabilities except 0, 50, and 100%. In order to make sense of an uncertain world, we often craft narratives that enable us to make decisions and move forward. Unfortunately, these narratives tend to be compromised by two traits: our penchant for overconfidence and our aversion to risk (see footnote #1). This generally leads us to sorely misestimate the likelihood of almost all events facing us as we move through our lives. An even more frustrating truth to face is that even if we correctly act on probabilistic information (know the true odds of a given event and make the best decision possible) the outcome may be opposite of what we favored. So, what to do? This blog post aims to offer some tips and tricks that are likely to lead to greater fulfillment of all your most accurately estimated dreams! Let’s learn from a simple example. I’ll use a sports betting analogy to highlight the benefits of using calibrated probabilistic forecast models (like the CPC ENSO forecast!) for real-world decisions. Say you're a Bulls fan, and there’s a betting pool at work. Given no information about them or their competition, you would assume that the odds that they win any given game is 50-50. In reality, not all teams are equally matched, so the true chances the Bulls will win a given game will vary. To maximize your odds of large profits over the season, you need a system for guiding how much to bet based on a range of probabilities. Good probabilistic decision making requires two key items (see footnote #2 for additional commentary): The Bulls will win their game tomorrow night. This table shows what you will gamble based on what you think the probability is of the Bulls winning against whatever team they are playing. The maximum you can put into the pool is $50. Your decision support system (DSS) for determining how much to bet based on your estimate of the percent chances of the Bulls beating their opponent. If the odds are less than 50%, you don’t risk your money. The higher the odds above 50%, the more you bet. (Note: this table above is your decision support system or DSS.) Now that we have our DSS, we can mock up how this system would work out in 3 situations: How would you wind up in each of these situations? I worked up some code (see footnote #3) so we can explore the outcomes! Each experiment simulates 1,000 seasons of 82 games each. The tables below show excerpts from one season of the second (perfect estimates of the chances of winning) and third experiments (estimates of the odds of a Bull’s victory are good, but not perfect.) (top) A simulated season in Experiment 2, where if you predict the Bulls have a 90 percent chance of winning a game against the 76ers, they do, in fact, win against them 90% of the time (line 2). (bottom) A season from Experiment 3, where your estimates of the chances are good, but not perfect. You estimate the Bulls have a 60% percent chance of beating the Wizards over time, but they only beat them 50 % of the time (Line 81).  graphic, based on data from Brian Zimmerman. The bar charts below shows the results of the experiments. The top row is experiment 1 (random betting), the middle is Experiment 2 (you predict the Bull’s chance of winning perfectly), and the bottom is Experiment 3 (good, but not perfect.) Each bar chart shows the cumulative profit or loss from betting after 1,000 simulated basketball seasons. The amount of profit or loss is shown across the bottom of the chart, and the height of the bar indicates how many seasons had that total. When you bet randomly (top), you lose as often as you win, and your average profit is close to zero. When you bet following a decision support system that risks more when you think the Bulls' odds of winning are higher, you make more than $500 on average even if you can't predict their odds of winning perfectly (bottom).  image, based on data from Brian Zimmerman. The first thing to notice is that by simply utilizing a tailored decision support system (DSS), you can come out ahead over time even if all you know is the probability of your team winning a game. The figure above makes this obvious; randomly betting performs much worse overall! Yes, sometimes the Bulls lose when the chance of winning is high, but if you stick to the program (your DSS), you will end up ahead at the end of the season (in this simulation, see footnote #4). Now, you might be saying to yourself, “Okay, sure, you can come out ahead if you know the probabilities perfectly, but no one actually knows the true odds of their team winning any game.” Not to fear! The bottom row of the graphic shows that, over the long haul, the consistent implementation of decisions derived from your DSS is almost always lucrative even when your forecasts are not perfectly reliable! It’s the DSS that is critical here. Comparing the three experiments, we see something we’d expect—that using a decision support system based on perfect knowledge of the probabilities is the MOST lucrative. But we can also see something that is perhaps not intuitive: the figure below shows that over shorter periods of time, our imperfect estimates (or even random bets!) will sometimes put us further ahead than using perfect estimates of the odds. Out of a thousand seasons, there will be some where random betting (top) or imperfect estimates of the chances of winning (middle) will make as much money as betting with perfect knowledge of the probabilities (bottom). Inevitable negative outcomes can be one of the hardest things for people to accept about forecasts that use probabilities.  image, based on data provided by Brian Zimmerman. That is because there is still some randomness in the actual outcomes of the game (see footnote #3 on “noise”). A 60% chance of victory means that you will lose your bets on occasion (60% does not equal 100%). It's inevitable that there will be a single game, or even 5- or 10-game stretches (possibly even an entire season!), where you actually end up with higher profits using a DSS with imperfectly estimated probabilities or even just random bets. This is shown in a different way in the line graph below. I cherry–picked a season that shows both Experiment 1(random guesses) and Experiment 3 (good, but not perfect estimates of the true probability) performing better than Experiment 2 (perfect prediction of the probability)—but only for the 1st half of the season! In the end, if you follow your DSS, you end up much better off than randomly betting, even with imperfect estimation of the probabilities. Game by game cumulative profits for season 796 from each of the three experiments. In this season of the experiments, the bettor scenario using a decision support system with true probabilities (blue) did worse than the other two strategies until the very end of the 82-game season!  image, adapted from original by Brain Zimmerman. This simple example shows how we can benefit from uncertain, probabilistic estimates of the chances a team will win a game. As frustrating as it may be, a single bad game or even one bad season doesn't mean our strategy is flawed. Making decisions based on weather, climate, and ENSO forecasts is similar! In fact, any probabilistic forecast is similar. In ENSO forecasting, a premium is put on using so-called “calibrated” forecast models, which are constructed using long hindcasts to create more reliable outlooks. In calibrating the model output, the goal is to make the forecast estimates closer to the true probabilities - which pushes us closer to the case outlined by Experiment #2. This allows for the highest chance of the best outcomes over the long haul, but also by no means guarantees them. Having a solid DSS means we also have considered our tolerance for risk and how to act upon the estimated forecast probabilities. This should help us avoid disappointment and stay true to the course when we don’t get an outcome we hoped for. In an inherently uncertain world, it’s the best we can do.

Forecasters continue to favor La Niña later this year, with an approximately 60% chance it will develop in September–November. The probability of La Niña is a bit lower than last month, though, and it’s likely to be a weak event. La Niña is the cool phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a pattern of alternating warmer (El Niño) and cooler surface waters in the tropical Pacific. Rising warm air in the tropics is what drives global atmospheric circulation, and therefore the jet stream, storm tracks, and resulting temperature and rain patterns. ENSO’s varying sea surface temperature changes where the strongest rising air motion occurs, hence changing global atmospheric circulation. ENSO is predictable several months in advance, and when you couple that predictability with our knowledge of how it changes global patterns, you get an early picture of potential upcoming weather and climate patterns. Let’s take a spin through recent conditions in the tropical Pacific. The threshold for La Niña is a sea surface temperature in the Niño-3.4 region in the central equatorial Pacific that is equal to or more than 0.5 °C below the long-term average.

However, even a weak event can influence temperature, rain, and snow patterns across the world. Today, we’ll take a tour through current conditions in the tropical Pacific and consider some of the things that might be interacting with La Niña’s development. La Niña, the cool phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), features cooler-than-average surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The warm phase, El Niño, includes warmer-than-average surface waters, and ENSO-neutral is when the surface temperature is close to average. These shifts in the temperature of the central and eastern tropical Pacific change the pattern of rising air in that region, with La Niña’s cooler waters leading to less rising air and storms. The atmospheric circulation over the tropics drives patterns around the world, including the jet streams and storm tracks. So, when La Niña or El Niño alter the tropical circulation, global circulation is shifted in known ways. Since ENSO can be predicted months in advance, it can give us an early idea of upcoming changes in temperature and rain/snow patterns. Our primary ENSO metric is the temperature of the sea surface in the part of the east-central tropical Pacific known as the Niño-3.4 region. October",

    "date": null,
    "content": "Though many aspects of nature in the Northern Hemisphere tend to quiet down during the winter, the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex (we’ll just call it the polar vortex from here on) is just getting started. Read on to get a recap of what the polar vortex is, what happened over the past summer, and what antics the polar vortex has been getting into recently. For those of you who are new to the polar vortex blog or are reminiscing over those summer polar vortex-less days, let’s start with a brief recap [footnote 1]. The polar vortex is a band of strong west-to-east winds that forms in the stratosphere between about 10 and 30 miles above the North Pole every winter [footnote 2]. We define the strength of the polar vortex by the fierceness of the west-to-east winds at a latitude of 60 degrees North and 10-hPa (~19 miles/30 kilometers). After it wakes up from its summer hibernation, the polar vortex can be a solitary creature, content to roam around by itself in the stratosphere. So why do we, at the surface, care about it? Well, sometimes the polar vortex likes to join the rest of the atmospheric pack/sloth [footnote 3]. Though they might need a little swipe from the troposphere, the stratospheric west-to-east winds can break down into a “sudden stratospheric warming.” When these stratospheric warming events occur, the chances of cold weather across the eastern U.S. can increase for several weeks afterwards. Last season was an active year with two major warming events. Observed and forecasted (NOAA GEFSv12) wind speed (top) and temperature (bottom) in the polar vortex compared to the natural range of variability (faint shading). For the GEFSv12 forecast issued on December 1, the winds at 60 degrees North (the mean location of the polar vortex) are forecast to remain stronger than normal for at least the next 2 weeks (top, thick magenta line) before slowing down to near normal strength. Lower stratospheric temperatures over the polar cap (bottom, thick pink line) are favored to be slightly colder than normal. It’s interesting to note that these temperatures in the lower stratosphere were warmer than normal between July and October, potentially related to the increased stratospheric ozone levels.  image, adapted from original by Laura Ciasto. Even though the stratosphere tends to hibernate during the summer months in the absence of the polar vortex, that doesn’t mean it’s entirely quiet. In fact, the overly active season last winter/spring may have made it hard for some features of the stratosphere to completely settle down over the summer. The increased wave activity through the winter and spring that helped drive two major sudden stratospheric warmings did more than just weaken the stratospheric winds. According to Newman et al (",

Much like I did last November, I thought it would be a good time to delve into how these expected tropical Pacific conditions might influence the pattern of precipitation over North America this winter. After all, ENSO—the entire El Niño and La Niña system—is the single most predictable influence on year-to-year differences in average winter precipitation across the United States. Without further ado, let’s get to it! Last November we were anticipating a big El Niño to dominate the winter precipitation forecast. It’s a much different story this year, as ENSO has been transitioning to the opposite, cool phase. Moreover, this winter’s developing La Niña is expected to be quite weak, so we might also expect less of an ENSO influence on the winter precipitation pattern.

    "content": "When we launched this blog last winter, the atmosphere came through for us with not one, but two breakdowns of the stratospheric polar vortex. That was very considerate of it, given that many winters pass without even a single one. With all the excitement that occurs when the stratospheric polar vortex is disrupted during a sudden stratospheric warming, our readers might wonder whether there is any way to predict weeks or even months ahead of time the likelihood that one (or more!) will occur this upcoming winter. As we discussed last year, there are certain ingredients that need to come together to drive a sudden stratospheric warming. These can be boiled down to two main factors: The exact details of these factors are often not predictable beyond 7-10 days [footnote 1], but that doesn’t mean we can’t say anything about the likelihood of a polar vortex disruption and sudden warming happening in a given season. That’s because there are ocean and atmospheric climate patterns or oscillations that are potentially predictable weeks or months ahead of time, and these predictable climate patterns can influence the ingredients for a sudden stratospheric warming listed above. In other words, while we can’t predict the exact timing of a sudden warming months ahead of time, we might be able to give the odds (make a “probabilistic forecast”) that one is likely (or not) to occur at some point during the winter, based on how we think these other climate patterns will affect our sudden stratospheric warming recipe. We know that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives “teleconnections” – predictable patterns of high and low pressure that extend from the tropics into the mid-latitudes. These highs and lows represent large-scale atmospheric waves, which can be used to predict remote weather impacts. As Amy wrote about in a guest post on the ENSO blog a few years ago, these ENSO-related atmospheric waves can help to amplify–or dampen–normal high and low pressure patterns in the mid-latitudes, and that interaction affects whether these waves get big enough to travel into the stratosphere. On average, El Niño teleconnections tend to amplify more waves into the stratosphere, and those waves weaken wintertime polar vortex winds on average compared to La Niña (see the image below, left side). There’s a ~30% increase in sudden stratospheric warmings during El Niño winters [footnote 2; Polvani et al.",

A quick briefing, if you’re just joining us—La Niña is one phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a pattern of sea surface temperature and atmospheric changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean. La Niña’s signature is cooler-than-average surface water in the east-central Equatorial Pacific, while its counterpart, El Niño, features warmer-than-average surface water. The atmospheric circulation over the tropical Pacific, called the Walker circulation, exhibits characteristic changes during La Niña and El Niño, so we call ENSO a “coupled” ocean-atmosphere system. ENSO is a seasonal phenomenon, meaning it lasts for several months in a row. The atmospheric changes of ENSO are communicated all around the world, changing temperature and rain/snow patterns in known ways. Ok! We’ve been expecting La Niña to show up since last spring.

That’s because I too am human and get weirdly annoyed when the forecast is for something I want to happen, say 5 inches of snow, and then we end up with dry pavement. But, being a scientist, I also realize that weather and climate predictions contain uncertainty. And uncertainty stinks especially when you really want that outcome to materialize. So, today I am going to try to explain the inherent uncertainty that we typically see with winter (December–February) La Niña impacts over the United States. No one, I repeat, no one should be surprised when the expected La Niña impact—and by expected, I mean “based on what has happened during past events”—doesn’t happen everywhere we think it may happen. It would honestly be strange if it did! But, with any La Niña, even a weak one like the one we are currently observing, we can still bet on some La Niña-like impacts to arise. That’s true even if the impacts are not constant and across all twelve 3-month averages (“seasons”) that we produce climate outlooks for (They’re all here.).

ENSO can be predicted months in advance, and it changes global atmospheric patterns in known ways. This means studying ENSO provides an early assessment for potential weather and climate risks such as tornado and hurricane seasons, drought and flooding rains, extreme temperature, global crop yields and disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Our primary metric for ENSO is the surface temperature of the east-central tropical Pacific Ocean in what we call the Niño-3.4 region. Specifically, the temperature anomaly in this region—the departure from the long-term average, where long-term is currently",

Neutral is also the most likely state through the fall (greater than 50% chance). ENSO stands for “El Niño/Southern Oscillation,” a pattern of changes in the temperature of the ocean surface and atmospheric circulation of the tropical Pacific region. La Niña means the surface water is cooler than average, the trade winds are stronger, and the central equatorial Pacific receives less rain. On the other hand, El Niño is represented by warmer surface water, weaker trade winds, and more rain in the central and sometimes eastern Pacific. Both phases of ENSO change global weather and climate patterns, including temperature and rain/snow patterns, hurricanes, tornadoes, and many other impacts. Since El Niño and La Niña can be predicted months in advance, their known changes to global climate allow us an early picture of upcoming seasonal patterns. “ENSO-neutral” means that neither El Niño nor La Niña are in effect, and global seasonal conditions are less predictable (for more on what neutral means, check out the second half of this older blog post). How do we know that La Niña has ended? Our primary metric for ENSO is the surface temperature of the ocean in the Niño-3.4 region of the east-central Pacific.

First, let’s set the stage for why we care so much about El Niño and La Niña, the natural climate pattern collectively known as ENSO, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation.

    "content": "The Pacific Ocean has hit pause and settled into ENSO-neutral conditions, which are expected to continue through the Northern Hemisphere summer. This makes seasonal forecasting for upcoming global rain, temperature, and other patterns a bit trickier. The odds of La Niña increase through the fall but remain lower than the odds of neutral. By the November–January period, there’s a 48% chance of neutral and a 41% chance of La Niña, with El Niño a distant third. Grab your towel, today we’re touring the galaxy of ENSO-neutral and what it means for seasonal prediction. El Niño and La Niña, known collectively as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are a system of changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere. El Niño and La Niña alter global atmospheric circulation and the jet streams, affecting weather patterns around the world. El Niño and La Niña can often be predicted many months in advance, giving us an early heads-up for their impacts. ENSO-neutral conditions are in place when neither El Niño nor La Niña are present, and the tropical Pacific Ocean and atmosphere are close to the long-term average temperature and circulation. El Niño and La Niña have expected impacts on global seasonal weather and climate, but what about neutral? ENSO-neutral doesn’t mean we expect upcoming seasonal rain, snow, and temperature to be close to average. Rather, during neutral, we don’t have the same predictive information that El Niño and La Niña’s atmospheric changes provide, making upcoming patterns harder to predict very far in advance. Our primary ENSO measurement, the temperature of the Pacific Ocean surface in the central tropical Niño-3.4 region, has been near average for the past few months, following last winter’s dip below the La Niña horizon. According to our most reliable sea surface temperature dataset, the Niño-3.4 region was 0.2°C (about 0.4°F) cooler than the long-term average in May. 2-year history of sea surface temperatures in the Niño-3.4 region of the tropical Pacific for all La Nina events since",

The much-hyped polar vortex is a permanent fixture of the atmospheric circulation at both poles. Far from the equator and pitched into complete darkness each winter, the polar vortex contains the hemisphere’s coldest air. From the Arctic southward, the air gets warmer, gradually at first, but then rapidly. That rapid-transition point is where you find the polar jet stream—a fast-moving river of air that blows around the globe from west to east. The jet is the outermost edge of the vortex. While the key characteristics of the polar vortex—the fastest jet speeds and coldest air—are most pronounced at high altitudes, the same temperature, wind, and air pressure patterns can reach all the way down to the surface, especially in the winter, which is where the Arctic Oscillation* comes in.

Heavy rain—several hundred percent of normal in places—let to deadly and devastating floods in the region. With conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean bordering on El Niño for several months, it would seem more likely that monsoonal rains across the Maritime Continent would have been below-average: El Niño often suppresses rainfall in the Maritime Continent area. (See this ENSO blog post on the Walker Circulation for more details on how that works.) But not this year. Just the opposite in fact. The atmospheric part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) hasn’t really gotten its act together to declare an El Niño or to suppress monsoon rains, but even that doesn’t explain the above-average rains so far. What was the culprit? The enhanced phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), a disturbance of clouds, rains, winds, and pressure patterns that moves eastward along the equator. The disturbance takes 30 to 60 days to circle the planet and come back to where it started. While El Niño usually gets the headlines (and justifiably so: its influence is felt far and wide across the globe), other atmospheric phenomena can eclipse, for a short while, any ENSO-related shenanigans with the monsoon. To put the influences on the monsoon in another way, ENSO would be a musician with a huge number of hit songs. The MJO would be a one-hit wonder, who for a short-period of time overshadows the more established star. MJO events usually divide the globe into two sections: one with enhanced rains and the other with suppressed rains. It is this entire enhanced/suppressed couplet that moves east across the tropics on a 30 to 60 day time scale (for more information on the MJO, check out this post from the ENSO Blog.) This MJO event was no different. Though, this time, the enhanced section traveled through the Maritime Continent coinciding with the monsoon, making an already wet time of year even wetter.

    "date": null,
    "content": "A record breaking algal bloom continues to expand across the North Pacific reaching as far north as the Aleutian Islands and as far south as southern California. Amidst well-above average sea surface temperatures across the North Pacific and along the western coastline of North America, a toxic algal bloom has developed with far reaching consequences for sea life as well as regional and local economies. Scientists can track the distribution and biomass of large algal blooms by looking at surface chlorophyll concentrations in the ocean determined by satellites. The greener the color in the accompanying image, the more chlorophyll present, which can be used to estimate algal biomass levels. This image, taken for the month of July, shows high concentrations of surface chlorophyll along coastal areas up and down the West Coast as well as across a wide swath of the Gulf of Alaska. While algal blooms do occur with regularity across the Pacific Ocean, the size and duration of this year’s event, which began in May, has been particularly noteworthy. And with its large size, it has had a similarly large impact on marine life and fisheries up and down the West Coast. Algal blooms in the ocean are made up of microscopic marine plants that are also known as phytoplankton. Not all phytoplankton are dangerous, but certain species of algae produce neurotoxins that can cause human illness and, in extreme cases death, depending on the level of exposure. These toxic algae can be ingested by shellfish and plankton-eating fish as part of their normal diet, making these neurotoxins available to organisms higher in the food chain, including humans and marine mammals. Consumers of the toxic algae, along with some of their predators, can accumulate toxins to levels that adversely affect the health of humans and wildlife that eat these contaminated animals. According to Alaska Dispatch News in Anchorage, at least 9 Fin whales were found dead near Kodiak Island, AK in June, potentially related to the algae bloom; however, definitive proof that these mortalities were caused by algal toxins will be difficult to obtain. In July, Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association received reports of dead and dying whales, gulls and forage fish in the eastern and western Aleutian Islands, with samples being solicited to test for algal toxins. NOAA scientists are collaborating on a Gulf of Alaska cruise (PMEL, Ocean Acidification) to determine the extent of harmful blooms in Alaska waters. Elsewhere, over the past several months, extremely high levels of an algal toxin called domoic acid, which is produced by a group of phytoplankton called Pseudo-nitzschia, have led to closures of recreational razor clam harvests in Oregon and Washington, as well as closing of large portions of the Washington state Dungeness crab fishery and some of the sardine and anchovy fisheries in California. The fishery closures in California were not unexpected, as NOAA and NOAA-funded scientists recorded some of the highest domoic acid levels ever observed in Monterey Bay, CA. From CBS news and according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, levels of domoic acid were 10 to 30 times higher in Monterey Bay compared with blooms from the previous 25 years that these events have been documented in the Bay. NOAA has awarded grant and event response funding to Washington State in particular to monitor and study the current algae bloom. With so much at stake for marine wildlife and the economies that rely on them, NOAA scientists are continuing to monitor the bloom along the entire West Coast as it continues to persist and adversely impact a number of fisheries. In the meantime, Climate.gov will talk to NOAA and affiliated scientists about what climate and other environmental factors are behind this year’s extreme bloom.

Summer temperatures in Iran can routinely top 100°F, but 100°+ temperatures were not what made this event so remarkable and so potentially dangerous. The event was not the “dry heat” that people in the United States associate with the desert Southwest. Instead, the scorching temperatures were accompanied by extremely humid conditions, which give the human body even less ability to cool itself off. In the coastal city of Bandar Mahshahr on July 30 at 2:30pm and 4:30pm local time, the temperature reached 113°F and 111°F.

Flooding in southern Denham Springs, Louisiana, near the intersection of Interstate 12 and S. Range Avenue on August 15 (left), and three days later (right), after the waters had receded. NOAA aircraft images provided by the National Ocean Service. I also talked about how heavy downpours along the Gulf Coast of the United States have increased since the middle of the last century. That trend is consistent with what climate experts have predicted would happen as greenhouse gases warmed the planet: more water vapor in the air to fuel extremely heavy rain. By itself, that general connection isn’t conclusive evidence that global warming had a hand in the mid-August downpour in Louisiana. Now, however, a preliminary analysis of the event led by climate scientists at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory found that warming due to greenhouse gases has made—conservatively—events like the one in August at least 40% more likely and 10% more intense.

Month to date rainfall for the U.S. Southeast, showing a swath of 20+-inch rainfall totals across southern Florida.  map, based on PRISM data from Oregon State University. Since June 1, the southern tip of Florida has been absolutely doused with rain. A large swath of the state just north of Miami has received more than 10 inches of rain, with localized areas topping out at more than 20 inches in just 11 days. These totals are over 400% of normal. On June 2, more than five inches of rain was recorded in Miami. A few days later on June 6 and 7, another 4 inches of rain fell in Miami. This was a pittance compared to communities in Collier and Broward County, which recorded more than 10 inches of rain during the same 48 hours. The June 6 rains broke daily rainfall records not only in Miami, but also in West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Naples. With rains this heavy, flash flooding was inevitable, leaving cars stranded and roads impassable. On a lighter note, it also led to the strange photo-op of people surfing down the streets of Fort Lauderdale. Not to be left out, the rest of the state observed tremendous rain, too. June rainfall through June 11 has been, in general, at least 150% of normal across the entire state. And similar to the large swath of particularly heavy rains in southern Florida, rains have also been over 300% of normal farther north around the Florida Panhandle. The rains have put a significant dent in the recent drought conditions throughout the state. The first U.S. Drought Monitor issued during June (on June 6) saw extreme drought—which had been affecting 15% of the state—disappear entirely. The amount of area considered to be under any level of drought also decreased by around 20%, from a peak of nearly 72% of the state as of the May 30 U.S. Drought Monitor to nearly 54% during the June 6 edition.

(The results are preliminary because, while the methods the experts used have been applied to many other published studies like this, this specific analysis has not yet been formally reviewed by other experts.) If they are correct, it would have been at least 150 times rarer before global warming. Theoretically, a 1-in-150,000-year event—so rare, they concluded, that it’s fair to say it would have been “virtually impossible” in pre-industrial times. Taken at face value, it would also mean that events like that aren’t about to become common any time soon.

Radar is an object detection system that works by emitting radio waves and measuring the time it takes for them to return after they bounce off objects (such as raindrops or snowflakes) in the air. Weather forecast maps commonly use animations of radar data—color patterns representing the location and intensity of precipitation—to warn people of approaching storms. NEXRAD (Next Generation Radar) stations obtain weather information (precipitation and wind) based upon returned energy. The radar emits a burst, or pulse, of energy. If the energy strikes an object (raindrop, snowflake, bug, bird, etc), the energy is scattered in all directions. A small fraction of the scattered energy is directed back toward the radar. The radar instrument receives a signal from this reflected energy during its listening period. Computers analyze the strength of the returned pulse, the time it took to travel to the object and back, and the phase shift of the pulse. This process of emitting a signal, listening for any returned signal, then emitting the next signal, takes place very fast, up to around",

    "content": "Pilots who are taking off or landing airplanes need current information about wind. Therefore, most airports have reliable observing stations that record wind speed and direction. The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) gathers wind data from networks around the world; you can use the dataset to explore winds at thousands of locations. A wind rose is a circular chart that shows where the wind comes from and how fast it blows. Similar to a compass, each \"spoke\" around the circle indicates a direction the wind blows: the length of each spoke indicates the amount of time the wind blows from that direction. Colors on each spoke indicate the portion of time wind blows at different speeds. The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects wind data from networks of airport-based observing stations around the world. Many of the stations and networks are similar to Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) installed at airports in the United States. Data collected at each station is available on the IEM website, organized by location or by the organization that administers the station's network. Choose a station of interest and examine its annual wind rose to understand which way and how fast the wind usually blows. Once you feel comfortable interpreting wind roses, compare them to maps of the station location, noting the directional orientation of nearby airport runways. Check wind roses for a coastal location. The first wind rose shows winds for the whole year. Scroll down to view plot for every month of the year. Multiple controls give you the opportunity to explore winds at very specific times. Custom controls also let you find the average winds for specific intervals over the period of record. If you want to check if winds have increased over time, use the controls to specify a period in the past, then select a similar period in the more recent past for comparison. Note that this application attempts to generate a wind rose for whatever time period you specify. To minimize the amount of data that the application has to process for initial explorations, the default time period is very short and may not produce a graphic. If you set the request for a large amount of data, it can take up to a few minutes to generate the plot. The site states that in general, data from airports is of good quality and representative of the local surrounding area.

The descriptions below can help you get a sense of the similarities and differences among various networks: The United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN) has 144 automated observation stations across the country. Stations are sited in areas that reflect the climate across their region, at relatively remote sites where instruments are unlikely to be disturbed over the coming decades. Instruments at each station record precise measurements of temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and other variables every 5 minutes. The National Weather Service Cooperative Observers Program (COOP) uses volunteer observers and/or automated instruments to collect observations at more than 11,000 stations. Each station has instruments to measure the highest and lowest temperatures of the day (maximum and minimum daily temperatures) and total precipitation. Every day, observers follow a consistent procedure to check (validate) their instruments and record their data. The Automated Surface Observations System (ASOS) maintains a network of stations sited mostly at airports. In addition to temperature and precipitation, these stations make a continuous record of wind speed and direction. These automated stations offer an efficient method for gathering and disseminating information: ASOS reports are updated every minute and broadcast to pilots in the vicinity of each station. For descriptions of other networks, stations, and the data they collect, see the National Centers for Environmental Information's Land-Based Stations page » Satellites, planes, ships, buoys, and gliders are among the platforms NOAA uses to monitor conditions.

Just as ground-based instruments improved over the years, scientists also invented reliable ways that monitor the environment at the ocean's surface, underwater, in the air, and from satellites on orbit. How do we know climate is changing? Which variables help us understand climate and detect climate change? An international group of meteorologists and climate scientists have agreed upon a list of 55 Essential Climate Variables that are measured consistently to characterize Earth's climate. This group also agreed upon a smaller set of Global Climate Indicators that provide key information for the most relevant domains of climate change. To learn more about the specific variables we monitor and the instruments we use to measure them see: The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) facility in Asheville, North Carolina maintains an extensive archive of climate data.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Climate classifications help people know what types of conditions a region usually experiences through the year. Rather than having to describe the full range of conditions observed in a region over each month or season of a year, a classification scheme can communicate expected conditions using just two or three terms. Knowing a region’s climate classification can be useful when choosing building materials for protection and durability, or when considering what crops are likely (or unlikely) to thrive in a region. For visitors, knowing a location’s climate classification can help them select appropriate clothing to pack. Geographers recognize a number of factors that affect a region’s climate: Together, these factors control the range of temperatures and the amount of rain and/or snow each region receives through the year. These factors control climate, and in turn, climate controls ecology—the types of native plants and animals that live in a region. Map by Peel, M. C., Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A. (University of Melbourne) via Wikimedia Commons. Long-term records of temperature and precipitation reveal climate patterns across continents, delineating them into climate regions. For example, the image on the right shows the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification System. Class names for classification systems based on weather patterns often include geographical names such as polar, tropical, continental, and marine. These terms are modified by terms describing temperature and moisture, or the intensity of weather during summer or winter. Examples of descriptors used in this method of classification include moist or dry, warm or cold, and temperate or severe. Putting them together results in climate classifications such as \"polar marine\" and \"temperate continental.\" Map by Ville Koistinen, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons Environmental indicators such as the range of native vegetation that thrives in a place can be used to classify a region's climate. As plant species can only thrive within a specific range of temperature and moisture conditions, it follows that those conditions must be present if the plants thrive in that location. If the climate is not suitable—too wet, too dry, or too cold in winter, for example—plants (and the animals that depend upon them for food or habitat) will struggle or die. These classification systems also utilize geographic terms, but are modified by biome names. Class names based on environmental indicators include names such as Arctic tundra, subtropical rainforest, and montane forests. Image by Peter Halasz, CC BY-SA 2.5, via Wikimedia Commons. The Holdridge Life Zone Classification scheme uses latitude, altitude, and humidity to identify a region's climate (see the diagram at right; click for a larger view). As classifications are based on plotting just three physical parameters—the straightforward system has become popular in modeling climate change impacts. Class names in this system are generally descriptive. Examples include dry tundra, wet forest, and desert scrub. As a region's temperature and precipitation patterns change, climate classifications based on those parameters will also change. Comparing past, present, and future ranges of plants and animals is one method that can show changing classifications. Scientists are currently observing changes in ecological relationships that are linked to our changing climate. For instance, the timing of spring budburst in some plants is occuring earlier than in the past. If this change in timing is not matched by the maturity of insects that depend on nectar from those flowers, the insects will lose this food supply. As temperature and precipitation patterns change, so too will ecosystems, and the climate classifications that are based on them. Help us improve our content",

    "content": "Some natural processes record the passage of time. For instance, layers of sediments can accumulate over many years, and some of them preserve information about weather conditions during the time they were deposited. Throughout Earth's history, global and regional climate has changed on very long time scales, and many of the past conditions can be discovered by studying natural records. Paleoclimatology is the study of natural systems that record climate conditions. Analyses of growth patterns in tree rings, corals, and cave structures can help us deduce conditions that existed hundreds to millions of years ago. Data that come from natural sources instead of from instruments are called proxy records. The word \"proxy\" indicates that these records stand in for direct measurements. One of the most easily recognized types of paleoclimate records is tree ring data. Trees that grow a single annual ring can preserve a record of the conditions they experienced each year. Fortunately, trees don't need to be cut down to reveal the pattern of their rings. Scientists turn tree-core drills (see below) into living trees and extract cores about as thick as a pencil. The surface of each core preserves the pattern of the rings' varying widths. Tree-core drill and wood core samples next to a tree slab. Dendrochronologists (tree-time scientists) count the number of growth rings and record the pattern of their widths. The pattern of varying widths can be matched against those of other trees to determine their age. Photo by Hannes Grobe Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 2.5 (Generic). Rocks deposited by glaciers are another example of proxy records. Scientists can recognize the distinctive pattern of sediments in rocks deposited by glaciers. Wherever they find glacial rocks then, they know that glaciers were present in that location at some point in the past. Once they examine fossils and other clues about when the rocks were deposited, they use the information to reconstruct the climate story for that location. Other sources of proxy data for climate include lake and ocean sediments, layers of ice (cored from ice sheets), corals, fossils, and historical records from ship logs and early weather observers. Learn more about proxy data » The most familiar methods to interpret natural records involve taking a core sample of the thing that produced the natural record. Field scientists use specialized equipment to take cores from trees, corals, sediments, and ice. By measuring the width, chemical composition, and physical structure of each layer in the core, scientists can deduce some of the conditions present when each layer formed. This chunk of ice comes from the first ice core drilled at Mt. Hunter, Alaska. Embedded pebbles and dust tell researchers that this portion of the ice core is from the bottom of a glacier, right above bedrock. Paleoclimatologists analyze isotopes of water in the annual layers of ice to determine the regional temperature when it fell as snow. Scientists also check the composition of air in trapped air bubbles to understand how the atmosphere changed over time. Photo by Mike Waszkiewicz. On the left, a diver drills a core from a coral colony. The right image shows the hole from which the core was extracted. The hole was plugged to prevent further injury to the coral colony. Another way to learn about past climate is to take the temperature of rocks at different depths within holes drilled into Earth’s crust. Exploration for oil and minerals often involves boring a hole into rock (a borehole) and bringing samples up for analysis. The boreholes they leave behind represent an opportunity to check the temperature of subsurface rocks. Rocks respond very slowly to changes in surface temperature conditions, and deeper rocks change temperatures more slowly than shallower rocks. Taking precise measurements of the rate of temperature change of rocks at various depths lets scientists deduce past temperatures at the surface. Explore borehole data: NOAA Borehole data » Paleoclimate records become even more valuable when scientists compare information collected using different proxies from locations around the world. Comparing their analyses, paleoclimatologists have identified common patterns of temperature trends that are broadly consistent across a variety of data collection methods. By comparing multiple sets of proxy records, scientists have reconstructed a fairly consistent record of Earth’s climate history. The broad agreement of several datasets increases our confidence that proxies reveal valid temperature records. The graphs below help illustrate the general agreement of results from multiple science teams using different methods to reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperature since 700 CE. The labels next to each line color in the legends refer to the scientific papers in which the data were published. Note that instrumental and proxy records alike indicate an unprecedented increase in Northern Hemisphere temperature over the last 200 years. These three graphs show the general agreement of different types of proxy data. The climate history shown here is a reconstruction of temperature in the Northern Hemisphere.

    "content": "Across the globe, in response to increases in heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, temperature and precipitation patterns are changing. The rate of climatic change in the next century is expected to be significantly higher than it has been in the past. At our current rate of emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that CO2 levels in the atmosphere will double or triple during the next century, and the climate system will respond. Scientists expect some portions of the Earth system to respond more rapidly to the changing composition of the atmosphere than others. For instance, the temperature of the atmosphere and the uppermost layer of the ocean are likely to adjust to new conditions more quickly than the deep ocean or thick ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. As a result of the different response rates, scientists predict that regional climatic changes will vary. For example, climate models project that some areas will see more precipitation and others will have less. Climate scientists expect to see the following changes within decades to hundreds of years: The following changes are likely to occur over hundreds to thousands of years: Though Earth will always have distinct seasons because of its tilted axis, one expected signal of climate change is a shift in the length and character of summer and winter seasons. In general, summer temperatures will arrive earlier than they currently do, especially at high latitudes. Additionally, they will be hotter and last longer than they do now. Future winters will arrive later and be shorter and warmer. Around the world, climatologists have already observed increases in the number of days of record heat, and concurrent decreases in the number of days of record cold. While the climate record has no perfect analog for the changes we expect to occur in the future, we can use a climatic event that happened 55 million years ago—the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)—as an example of our potential climate future.

Each of the thousands of 3-dimensional grid cells can be represented by mathematical equations that describe the materials in it and the way energy moves through it. The advanced equations are based on the fundamental laws of physics, fluid motion, and chemistry. To \"run\" a model, scientists specify the climate forcing (for instance, setting variables to represent the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere) and have powerful computers solve the equations in each cell. Results from each grid cell are passed to neighboring cells, and the equations are solved again. Repeating the process through many time steps represents the passage of time. Image source: NOAA. Climate models are based on well-documented physical processes to simulate the transfer of energy and materials through the climate system. Climate models, also known as general circulation models or GCMs, use mathematical equations to characterize how energy and matter interact in different parts of the ocean, atmosphere, land. Building and running a climate model is complex process of identifying and quantifying Earth system processes, representing them with mathematical equations, setting variables to represent initial conditions and subsequent changes in climate forcing, and repeatedly solving the equations using powerful supercomputers. Check out The Very, Very Simple Climate Model » Climate models separate Earth’s surface into a three-dimensional grid of cells. The results of processes modeled in each cell are passed to neighboring cells to model the exchange of matter and energy over time. Grid cell size defines the resolution of the model: the smaller the size of the grid cells, the higher the level of detail in the model. More detailed models have more grid cells, so they need more computing power. See an animation showing different grid sizes » Explore practical information for those interested in participating in global climate model experiments » Climate models also include the element of time, called a time step. Time steps can be in minutes, hours, days, or years. Like grid cell size, the smaller the time step, the more detailed the results will be.

Some of the energy that arrives at Earth is reflected back into space, another portion is absorbed directly by the atmosphere, and the remainder moves through the atmosphere to the planet's surface. Sunlight energy heats land and water at the surface, and in turn, they emit heat. This heat provides further warming of the atmosphere. The mix of gases in our atmosphere keeps some of the heat energy from escaping directly to space, similar to the way a blanket keeps warmth near your body. This process is the naturally occurring greenhouse effect, and it keeps Earth warm enough to support life. In accordance with the basic laws of thermodynamics, as Earth absorbs energy from the sun, it must eventually emit an equal amount of energy to space.

Source: Weather.gov Coop Station page. Surface air temperature is the temperature of the air around us, generally measured at a height of two meters (about 6 and a half feet) above the ground. Thermometers that measure surface air temperature must be shielded from direct sunshine. It's common to see thermometers with a liquid such as alcohol or mercury in a glass tube. Thermometers used for monitoring weather and climate work by checking how much electricity can pass through a sample of pure metal such as platinum. As electrical resistance increases with temperature, resistance measurements can be converted to precise temperature measurements.

It can be in the form of drizzle, snow, ice, freezing rain, or hail. Rain gauges are the most common instrument used to measure rainfall. A rain gauge is an open-at-the-top container that is calibrated to measure the depth of liquid caught. In the United States, the depth of precipitation is reported in inches. Satellite instruments can also detect and estimate precipitation amounts.

On the ground, the amount of solar radiation that reaches a site can be measured by an instrument called a pyranometer. At the top of the atmosphere, similar instruments on satellites measure the amount of incoming solar radiation.

When air pressure increases, the balloon material is pushed into the jar and the stick moves upward. Credit: Svenja Lohner, Science Buddies. Air pressure is the weight-per-unit area of the column of air above it. As gas molecules are always moving in every direction, air pressure is the same in all directions. Barometers measure air pressure. The most common type of barometer is a sealed flexible container of air. When the air pressure outside the container changes, the container responds by contracting or expanding. This change is registered by a needle or digital readout. These values are expressed in millibars. A millibar is a unit of pressure commonly used in aviation and meteorology. One millibar is equal to 100 Newtons per square meter. One thousand millibars is the average pressure at sea level. Changes in atmospheric pressure can indicate a change in weather. More information: Air Pressure Links to data: Credit: Adobe Stock. Wind is air in motion relative to the Earth's surface. It is a vector quantity, meaning it is described in terms of both speed and direction of motion. Winds are most commonly described in only their horizontal direction. Anemometers are used to measure wind speed. Wind vanes and windsocks measure wind direction. Wind directions refer to where the wind is coming from; for example, a north wind is coming from the north and blowing towards the south.

Water vapor is the raw material from which clouds form. Though it is invisible to the human eye, this gas absorbs and emits infrared radiation, which traps heat energy near Earth's surface. Half of the water vapor in the atmosphere is found within two kilometers of the Earth's surface. Absolute humidity is the measure of the amount of water vapor in air. Relative humidity tells how much water vapor is in the air relative to the amount it has the potential to hold at a given temperature and pressure. The instrument used to measure water vapor content in the air is called a hygrometer. The simplest type of hygrometer is made from human hair, which swells and lengthens as it absorbs water vapor from the air.

Climate scientists observe and monitor the properties of clouds because the type of clouds in the sky are an indicator of the atmospheric processes occurring where they formed. Cloud properties include ice crystal size and type, temperature, and thickness. Instruments on satellites are commonly used to observe cloud properties.

The relative amounts of major atmospheric gases have changed dramatically since Earth's early history, but they have been relatively stable for thousands of years. Atmospheric gases are well mixed up to an altitude of 80 km (50 mi). The relative concentrations of several trace gases in the atmosphere determine the atmosphere's ability to trap solar radiation. In order to make precise measurements of atmospheric composition, scientists gather air in flasks, and analyze it in a laboratory. More information: Links to data: Help us improve our content",

The volume of water that flows past a point of a river per unit time is called river discharge; it is commonly expressed in cubic feet per second, or sometimes, in gallons per day. River discharge, also called flow rate, is calculated by multiplying the average velocity of the water by the cross-sectional area of the river channel. Discharge is measured by stream gauges or weirs. River discharge forecasts are based on historical flows, topography, and current conditions of soil and weather.

In the Northern Hemisphere, snow cover has a significant influence on climate due to the fact that it is four to six times more reflective than bare ground. Satellites are used to measure large expanses of snow cover. The amount of snow on the ground is also monitored at snow monitoring sites in the Western United States. These sites have precipitation gauges and \"snow pillows\" in areas cleared of trees. The snow pillow measures how much water is in the snowpack by weighing the snow with a pressure transducer. These SNOTEL sites provide important measurements of snow depth and water content. Water managers use these measurements to predict water supply and the potential for spring floods. More information: Links to data: Monitoring glaciers in Glacier National Park. Photo by National Park Service. A glacier is an accumulation of ice and snow that slowly flows downhill over land. In high mountain areas, alpine glaciers are frozen rivers of ice, flowing under their own weight into valleys. Glaciers also exist on the fringes of ice sheets. Most of the world’s glaciers are in Antarctica. Glaciers are mainly found near the poles, but glaciers exist on all the world’s continents. For more than a century, the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) and its predecessor organizations have been collecting standardized data on glaciers around the world, using a combination of boots-on-the-ice field work and measurements from aerial and space-based instruments.

Ice sheets are made of thousands of layers of fallen snow. The weight of overlying layers compresses snow, causing it to recrystallize into solid ice . Though they appear to be solid, ice sheets slowly spread out under their own weight, forming broad domes of ice over land.

The presence of microscopic algae (phytoplankton) can have a strong influence on the color of the ocean. When populations of floating phytoplankton have the right combination of nutrients, sunlight, and water temperatures, the number of individuals can expand very quickly. These population explosions can result in \"blooms\" of phytoplankton large enough to be visible from space. Suspended sediments and solutions of dissolved materials can also affect ocean color. Instruments on satellites measure ocean color from space. More information: Links to data: Phytoplankton are tiny plants (algae) that float freely in the ocean. They are often accompanied by zooplankton, or microscopic animals. These microscopic organisms form the base of the global oceanic food chain. Through photosynthesis, scientists estimate that marine phytoplankton produce about half of the world's oxygen. Scientists measure phytoplankton abundance by straining marine water samples through very fine mesh nets. More information: Links to data: Wave crashing over vessel in a large swell.

As salty ocean water freezes, some of the salt is expelled, and the brine below it becomes saltier and more dense. Sea ice extent is defined as the area where at least 15% of the surface is covered with ice. Sea ice extent changes with the seasons in both hemispheres. Satellite instruments measure sea ice extent.

Some people who spend a lot of time outdoors can still recognize insect, bird, and animal behaviors as signs of changing weather. All around the world, weather and climate influence how people live. The types of homes we build for comfort and safely, the crops we grow for food and clothing, and the recreational opportunities we enjoy are all matched to our long-term weather patterns. We strive to understand and predict the weather in order to better our lives. Weather is the short-term state of the atmosphere, in the past, present, or future. Weather can vary from minute to minute and location to location. For instance, it's not unusual for a place to have a cold and rainy morning that gives way to a warm and sunny afternoon. Sometimes, rain falls on one side of a town, but not on the other. In order to make sense, descriptions of weather must always include both when and where the conditions occurred.

Orange to red areas were warmer than 50°F; the darker the shade, the warmer the monthly average temperature. Daily temperature readings come from weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-D). Volunteer observers or automated instruments collect the highest and lowest temperature of the day at each station over the entire month, and submit them to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). After scientists check the quality of the data to omit any systematic errors, they calculate each station’s monthly average of daily mean temperatures, then plot it on a 5x5 km gridded map. To fill in the grid at locations without stations, a computer program interpolates (or estimates) values, accounting for the distribution of stations and various physical relationships, such as the way temperature changes with elevation. The resulting product is the NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid). Shades of blue show areas that had monthly average temperatures below 50°F. The darker the shade of blue, the lower the average temperature. Areas shown in shades of orange and red had average temperatures above 50°F.

These maps focus on broad-scale conditions, so local conditions may vary. Categories reflect how much water is available in streams, lakes, and soils compared to usual for the same time of year. The darker the shade on the map, the more intense the drought conditions. For maps showing drought status in Alaska, Hawai'i, and other U.S. territories, please access the source data for this snapshot, the U.S. Drought Monitor. Each week, drought experts consider how recent precipitation totals compare to their long-term averages. They check temperatures, moisture levels in soils, and water levels in streams and lakes. They also watch for indicators of drought such as vegetation stress. Altogether, experts check dozens of indicators to establish consensus for drought categories across the map. Before the weekly map is published, up to 350 people across the country review the draft to check it against reality. Each final map represents experts' best judgments of regional-scale drought conditions, validated by partners in the field. Colors on the map show where the land is drier than usual for this time of year. Areas shown in yellow are Abnormally Dry. In general, this category indicates land that is going into or coming out of drought. Tan areas are experiencing Moderate Drought: water supplies may be low and damage may occur to crops and pastures. Orange areas are in Severe Drought: water shortages are common and crop and pasture losses are likely. Red areas are experiencing Extreme Drought. Areas in this category may experience widespread water shortages and major losses of crops and pastures; forests in these areas become dry and susceptible to fire. Dark red areas are in Exceptional Drought. Shortages of water in streams, reservoirs, and wells in these areas can lead to water emergencies. Failed crops, barren pastures, and tinder-dry forests may be widespread across these areas. Most regions of the United States experience drought at least occasionally. Depending on its severity and duration, drought can devastate crops and forests, lead to shortages of food for livestock and wildlife, increase the risk of wildfires, and have a negative effect on local and regional economies.

Areas where experts expect below-average precipitation or above-average temperatures (which increase evaporation) may see drought develop, persist, or worsen. Areas with forecasts for above-average precipitation may see drought conditions improve or end. Starting with knowledge of current drought status, experts examine weather forecasts and climate outlooks to check the chances for below-, near-, or above-average precipitation and temperature during the next month. The experts also consider seasonal patterns of precipitation (for example, if a region usually has a wet summer), if an El Niño or La Niña event is occurring, and if an active tropical storm season is expected. They compare this range of factors with forecasts to determine if conditions are likely to become drier or wetter. Based on this input, experts make their best estimates of how conditions will change, and assign regions into outlook categories on the map. Colors show experts' assessments of where and how conditions related to drought are likely to change by the end of next month.

The darkest blue shows the coldest water: floating sea ice is usually present in these areas. Lighter shades of blue show temperatures of up to 80°F. White and orange areas show where surface temperatures are higher than 80°F, warm enough to fuel tropical cyclones or hurricanes. Satellite instruments measure sea surface temperature—often abbreviated as SST—by checking how much energy comes off the ocean at different wavelengths. Computer programs merge sea surface temperatures from ships and buoys with the satellite data, and incorporate information from maps of sea ice. To produce the daily maps, programs invoke mathematical filters to combine and smooth data from all three sources. The darkest blue areas show sea surface temperatures as low as 28°F. Sea ice, which can look like anything from a slushy mix of floating ice crystals to a solid surface of white, is usually present in these areas. Progressively lighter shades of blue show increasingly warmer temperatures, up to 80°F. White and orange areas on the map show where the surface temperature is above 80°F. Tropical storms that cross these areas can strengthen to form cyclones and hurricanes. While heat energy is stored and mixed throughout the depth of the ocean, the temperature of water right at the sea's surface—where the ocean is in direct contact with the atmosphere—plays a significant role in weather and short-term climate. Where sea surface temperatures are high, relatively large amounts of heat energy and moisture enter the atmosphere, sometimes producing powerful, drenching storms downwind.

Outlooks can also help them choose the best time to schedule maintenance procedures. Forestry managers also check temperature outlooks. When they see increased chances for warmer-than-usual weather, they prepare for more wildfires. Managers in agricultural industries also want to know if temperatures are likely to be warmer or cooler than usual. This information can help them optimize food production. Data Snapshots are derivatives of existing data products: to meet the needs of a broad audience, we present the source data in a simplified visual style. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) produces the source images for monthly temperature outlooks. To produce our images, we run a set of scripts that access mapping layers from CPC, re-project them into desired projections at various sizes, and output them with a custom color bar. CPC issues monthly outlooks one-half month before the beginning of the month of interest. On the day before the new month begins, experts update the outlook for the upcoming month. Each monthly outlook in Data Snapshots shows the date the outlook was issued.

The darker the color, the higher the total precipitation. Daily measurements of rain and snow come from weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-D). Volunteer observers or automated instruments gather the data and submit them to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). After scientists check the quality of the data to omit any systematic errors, they calculate each station’s monthly total precipitation and plot it on a 5x5 km gridded map. To fill in the grid at locations without stations, a computer program interpolates (or estimates) values, accounting for the distribution of stations and various physical relationships, such as the way temperature changes with elevation. The resulting product is the NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid). Areas shown in white received little or no measurable precipitation for the month. Areas shown in the lightest green received less than one inch of water from rain or snow. The darker the color on the map, the higher the precipitation for the month. Areas shown in dark blue received eight inches or more of precipitation that fell as either rain or snow. Note that snowfall totals are reported as the amount of liquid water they produce upon melting. Thus, a 10-inch snowfall that melts to produce one inch of liquid water would be counted as one inch of precipitation. Farmers and gardeners who depend on rain for their plants want to know if enough precipitation has fallen to support plant growth. Similarly, forest managers and ranchers check monthly precipitation to monitor the status of the environment. Water managers who work to ensure that towns and cities have enough water for drinking, washing, and industrial uses are also interested in how much precipitation falls each month.

Areas where experts expect below-average precipitation or above-average temperatures (which increase evaporation) may see drought develop, persist, or worsen. Areas with forecasts for above-average precipitation may see drought conditions improve or end. Starting with knowledge of current drought status, experts examine weather forecasts and climate outlooks to check the chances for below-, near-, or above-average precipitation and temperature during the next three months. The experts also consider seasonal patterns of precipitation (for example, if a region usually has a wet summer), if an El Niño or La Niña event is occurring, and if an active tropical storm season is expected. They compare this range of factors with forecasts to determine if conditions are likely to become drier or wetter. Based on this input, experts make their best estimates of how conditions will change, and assign regions into outlook categories on the map. Colors show experts' assessments of where and how conditions related to drought are likely to change by the end of next three months. Gold areas are not currently experiencing drought, but they are likely to become drier through the next three months. Dark brown areas show where drought conditions currently exist and are likely to persist or worsen. Tan areas are currently experiencing drought; they are likely to see improvement, but not an end, to drought conditions. Green shows where drought conditions are likely to end. Drought outlooks can help decision makers plan ahead. For instance, if drought is likely to develop in a region, farmers and ranchers may decide to delay planting, plant a drought-resistant crop, or stockpile food and water for livestock. Forestry officials may choose to hire additional firefighters and secure equipment to be ready to fight wildfires. Water managers may consider instituting water restrictions. If drought is likely to improve or end, ranchers may choose to begin using stockpiled resources, and farmers may choose crops that require adequate moisture.

Brown areas were drier than average for that month, and blue-green areas were wetter than average for that month. These maps are based on blended measurements from satellite observations and on-the-ground (“in situ”) measurements. Clouds and precipitation scatter and absorb different wavelengths of energy in consistent ways, creating an energy “signature” that satellites detect. Satellites collect data all around the world, but there is greater uncertainty in their estimates of precipitation amounts. Observations from the ground are more accurate, but there are many places—including the entire global ocean—where there are no ground-based data. This dataset combines the two types of data to provide a globally complete record of precipitation that is accurate and consistent enough to be used for climate research.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Some Southern California estuaries may be more vulnerable than others to larger waves and higher water levels associated with El Niño events and climate change, according to a recent study by researchers at the Center for Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. Southern California estuaries usually don’t receive substantial river flows and depend heavily on tides for water circulation. This, combined with migrating sand at the estuary mouth, means that they can be vulnerable to closure–leading to impacts such as increased water levels and flooding of nearby infrastructure, poor water quality and dramatic drops in dissolved oxygen levels which negatively impact species that live in the estuary. Estuaries and their associated wetlands are important for water quality and biodiversity. They also lower the risk of coastal flooding and may take up carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. These characteristics make estuaries valuable to California’s economy and ecology. Scientists are trying to understand how estuaries will respond to sea-level rise and a changing climate, so that coastal managers and landowners can prepare accordingly. El Niño conditions along the California coast often give a preview of the predicted effects of climate change locally, such as higher sea levels and strong wave events. Read more at the link below.

    "date": null,
    "content": "The ocean is a major carbon sink, estimated to absorb more than a quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air, largely through photosynthesis by phytoplankton, microscopic plants living near the surface of the ocean. The ocean is also one of the biggest question marks in climate modeling: scientists do not yet have a full understanding of the mechanisms that move absorbed carbon from the ocean surface thousands of feet down to the ocean floor. Recent research at one station off the coast of California suggests that the carbon export to the deep ocean could be increasing, through more frequent “flux” events that dump large amounts of carbon in a short period of time. New research from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) shows that the majority of this exported material comes from phytoplankton, or tiny plants, digested into fecal pellets that can sink rapidly through the water column. A chain of jellyfish-like plankton known as salps. By feeding on plant-like phytoplankton, they concentrate carbon from the atmosphere into dense fecal pellets that settles at the bottom of the sea.

Used under a Creative Commons license. “This process of sinking particles is called the biological pump,” explains Moss Landing researcher Colleen Durkin, who led a recent California Sea Grant-funded project in partnership with MBARI researcher Ken Smith and other scientists at MBARI and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Researchers hope that by better understanding what makes up the particles that reach the ocean floor—and how they get there—they can refine models of the carbon cycle and help improve projections of climate change and ocean processes.

    "title": "Monitoring kelp forests in California's Marine Protected areas",
    "date": null,
    "content": "Some of California’s most important forests don’t have trees. Up and down the West Coast, kelp—a large, plant-like brown algae—supports marine life and local economies. “It’s really quite an iconic ecosystem,” says Mark Carr, a kelp forest ecologist from UC Santa Cruz. With a growth rate of up to a foot and a half per day, kelp beds are a particularly productive—or fast-growing—ecosystem. “That productivity supports a huge number of species,” says Carr. Otters, seals, shorebirds, and even whales benefit. (Meet some of the species that call California kelp forests home in the video to the right by UC Santa Barbara researcher Katie Davis Koehn, Channel Islands, California.) In addition to providing vital habitat and food for marine life, kelp forests also support coastal communities. They sustain commercial and recreational fisheries, promote ecotourism, consume carbon, and prevent coastal erosion by slowing down waves before they reach the shore. “And then there's the cultural significance,” says Carr. Generations of Indigenous peoples along the coast consider kelp forests a part of their story and natural heritage. But first fishing and now marine heatwaves threaten the existence of kelp beds. “There’s no question that right now, the number one threat to kelp forests along the coast is global climate change,” says Carr. It’s no surprise then, that kelp forests were included when California created a system of marine protected areas (MPAs). “One of the unique elements of MPAs is that they’re really designed to protect a whole ecosystem, rather than individual species,” says Carr. He worked closely with state officials on the Marine Life Protection Act, which involved the creation of a new network of protected areas. Now, Carr works with colleagues across four academic institutions and citizen scientists around the state on a kelp forest monitoring project that assesses the effectiveness of MPAs as a conservation and management tool. The project is one of seven three-year awards that California Sea Grant administers for the California Ocean Protection Council and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The projects provide researchers, managers, and policy-makers with vital information about marine protected areas and ecosystems around the state. Read more at the link below.

These three species—ribbon, spotted, and harbor seals—are all typically resilient, long-lived predators that eat a variety of prey. In the past decade the Arctic region has undergone a rapid transformation. Temperatures rose. Sea ice extent and thickness fluctuated dramatically, reaching both record highs and lows within the past decade. Ecological changes have been profound and relatively well-documented for fish and lower trophic (food web) levels. Scientists have observed changes in species distributions, reproductive and mortality rates, and body condition of individuals. Changes in upper trophic levels have been less apparent. Many predators are difficult to observe and monitor. Some, especially generalist predators, are thought to be relatively insensitive to short-term ecosystem shifts. Their ability to switch among diverse prey allows them to smoothly adapt to changes in a few prey species. Read more at the link below. Click to read the full article",

The study will develop tools for forecasting acidification thresholds to help commercial shellfish growers make more informed decisions, thus helping to protect an industry that in recent years has generated around $15 million in farm-gate value in Virginia, and $9 million in Maryland. Increased seawater acidity hampers the growth and survival of oysters and other shellfish by eating away at their calcium carbonate shells, the same process that causes carbonated sodas to corrode the enamel of human teeth. It also reduces the number of carbonate ions dissolved in seawater, making it more difficult for oysters to build their shells in the first place.

A new paper published in Monthly Weather Review shows some promise for predicting subseasonal to seasonal tornado activity based on how key atmospheric parameters over the US respond to various climate signals, including El Niño and La Niña activity in the Pacific. In this study, a team of researchers from NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, and Climate Prediction Center presented an experimental seasonal tornado outlook model, named SPOTer (Seasonal Probabilistic Outlook for Tornadoes), and evaluated its prediction skill. SPOTter provides an initial forecast in late February for March-April tornado activity, and is then updated in late March for April-May activity. This partly statistical and partly dynamic (i.e., hybrid) model was built based on NOAA’s severe weather database from NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center and NOAA’s Climate Forecast System version 2.

    "date": null,
    "content": "As the planet warms, scientists expect that mountain snowpack should melt progressively earlier in the year. However, observations in the U.S. show that as temperatures have risen, snowpack melt is relatively unaffected in some regions while others can experience snowpack melt a month earlier in the year. This discrepancy in the timing of snowpack disappearance—the date in the spring when all the winter snow has melted—is the focus of new research by CPO-funded scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. In a new study published today in the journal Nature Climate Change, Scripps Oceanography climate scientists Amato Evan and Ian Eisenman identify regional variations in snowpack melt as temperatures increase, and they present a theory that explains which mountain snowpacks worldwide are most “at-risk” from climate change. The study was funded by NOAA‘s Climate Program Office (CPO) Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program. Looking at nearly four decades of observations in the Western U.S., the researchers found that as temperatures rise, the timing of snowpack disappearance is changing most rapidly in coastal regions and the south, with smaller changes in the northern interior of the country. This means that snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas, the Cascades, and the mountains of southern Arizona is much more vulnerable to rising temperatures than snowpack found in places like the Rockies or the mountains of Utah.

The announcement on World Ocean Day of more than 60 actions is the first batch of UN Decade action endorsements and is meant to encourage greater participation, collaboration, and co-development from around the world. The international NOAA BCI project will support countries’ efforts to integrate coastal wetlands into their National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. These inventories provide a transparent mechanism for tracking and assessing the status of coastal wetlands and their role in carbon sequestration and storage. The inclusion of this information in NGGIs can lead to enhanced protection and restoration of critical coastal wetlands, as well as contribute to climate mitigation.

The study, published in the journal Nature, explored whether these changes had altered how much carbon the Amazon stored in its vast forests. “Using nearly 10 years of CO2 (carbon dioxide) measurements, we found that the more deforested and climate-stressed eastern Amazon, especially the southeast, was a net emitter of CO2 to the atmosphere, especially as a result of fires,” said John Miller, a scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory and a co-author. “On the other hand, the wetter, more intact western and central Amazon, was neither a carbon sink nor source of atmospheric CO2, with the absorption by healthy forests balancing the emissions from fires.” Read more at the link below.

Credit: NOAA This summer’s barrage of extreme weather around the globe - including record heat waves, wildfires, and flooding - have amplified calls for urgent action to address climate change. The view that rapid, drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed is now the scientific consensus. More controversial are calls for investigating geoengineering techniques that may cool the planet quickly by reflecting sunlight away from Earth’s surface. One technique, called marine cloud brightening, would seek to make low-level clouds over the ocean more reflective and longer-lived by injecting them with small particles of salt generated by spraying seawater into the air. Theoretically, water vapor would collect on the surface of these salt particles creating additional cloud droplets that would reflect more sunlight back out to space. This may be easier said than done, according to new research published in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences by NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory and CIRES researchers. Using a sophisticated computer model that accurately simulates the miniscule changes in cloud droplets, the researchers found that both the size of the cloud seed particles and the number of particles injected are crucial for successfully brightening the clouds to reflect more sunlight. To make matters even more complicated, the optimal particle size is likely case (or cloud) dependent. Read more at the link below. Click to read the full article",

But a new study published this week in the journal Science confirms the role of the Southern Ocean as a significant carbon sink. Using observations from research aircraft flown during three field projects over nearly a decade, as well as a collection of atmospheric models, researchers found that the Southern Ocean absorbs 550 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere every year, or about 18 percent of the amount absorbed by all the world’s oceans. The study highlighted the value of airborne observations when investigating the global carbon cycle. “You can’t fool the atmosphere,” said NCAR scientist Matthew Long, the paper’s lead author. “While measurements taken from the ocean surface and from land are important, they are too sparse to provide a reliable picture of air-sea carbon flux.

This valuable, first-time finding may be indicative of ocean carbon chemistry patterns for other U.S. coastal areas significantly connected to rivers. The research, published in Geophysical Research Letters, used models to identify the main drivers of ocean acidification for different regions of the gulf. They provide evidence that river alkalinity has counteracted the progression of ocean acidification for coastal areas along the gulf. Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in seawater pH over time, mainly caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere being absorbed into the ocean. Seawater chemically reacts with carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, causing the ocean to become more acidic. Read more at the link below. Click to read the full article",

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major source of global climate variability. Its impact on sea surface temperature, in turn, dictates atmospheric circulation over the tropical Pacific, and these atmospheric variations significantly impact the hydroclimate of the North American continent. Given the outlook of general climatic projections, understanding ENSO’s impact on climate is becoming more important than ever. The research, published recently in Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology, uses a combination of paleoclimatic and instrumental data to more reliably quantify the impacts of variability in this interconnected system. The data sets were used to compare changes in frequency and intensity of diverse ENSO events in the pre-industrial period and the 20th century in different regions of the Pacific.

This testbed establishes a physical and virtual collaboration space for researchers and forecasters.

The Hurricane and Ocean Testbed will allow researchers and forecasters to explore opportunities and find solutions to common forecast challenges, resulting in better analyses and forecasts of high-impact tropical and marine weather and ocean conditions. The goal is for it to become an environment where the end-to-end process for analyses, forecasts, warnings, and response can be optimized. With the rise of more intense storms and increased damage to populated coastal areas, improving forecast accuracy and increasing the speed of transitioning hurricane and ocean research into operations have become even more urgent.

El Niño, triggered by westerly wind anomalies and subsequent redistributions of upper ocean heat content, can sharply reduce the regional supply of nutrients, limiting phytoplankton growth. GFDL’s new Earth System Model (ESM4.1) captures not only the onset and extent of chlorophyll anomalies during El Niño events, but also a pronounced post-El Niño “chlorophyll rebound” that produces positive equatorial Pacific chlorophyll anomalies in the summer following El Niño events. The authors demonstrate that the post-El Niño chlorophyll rebound occurs as a natural, delayed response to post-El Niño rather than requiring any physical La-Niña response. It is primarily driven by positive iron anomalies propagated from the subsurface western Pacific to the surface eastern Pacific cold tongue via the Equatorial Undercurrent. High post-El Niño dust deposition anomalies arising from dry land conditions in Central and South America augment the post-El Niño chlorophyll rebound. Read more at the link below.

Credit:  Prediction on weather and seasonal timescales has become routine, but the “subseasonal” time scale of a few weeks has proven difficult. The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), a large complex of tropical thunderstorms, is the dominant subseasonal phenomenon over the tropics, and its prediction is critical for subseasonal prediction of tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and other extreme events. GFDL has developed a new subseasonal prediction system using the GFDL Seamless System for Prediction and Earth-system Research (SPEAR), a global atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice coupled climate model. In 20 years of wintertime reforecasts, this study found that the average prediction skill of the MJO was 30 days, placing it among the very best MJO prediction models in the world. MJO events vary from event to event in their strength, life cycle, and propagation. The study showed that 4 distinct patterns of the MJO each have their own predictability. For the “fast-propagating” form, SPEAR is able to predict the MJO to 38 days. In contrast, the “standing” pattern is much more challenging, with predictability dropping to 23 days. SPEAR also accurately predicts the formation of new MJOs and the worldwide influence of each particular pattern on surface temperatures, crucial in using the MJO to predict extreme events. Forecasters can gain a better understanding of the MJO’s impacts by considering the MJO pattern, and potentially take advantage of certain patterns to issue extended range forecasts, in addition to the traditional indices.

Credit: NOAA Potential future changes in the genesis frequency and distribution of tropical cyclones are important for society, yet uncertain. Confidence in model projections largely relies on whether we can physically explain why the models projected such changes. After analyzing climate simulations from multiple models, the authors find that future changes in the patterns and frequency of tropical cyclone genesis are largely governed by dynamic effects—that is, by human-induced changes in the atmospheric circulation. These large-scale circulation changes include decreases in the mid-level upward motion and lower-to-mid level cyclonic vorticity, and increases in vertical wind shear. Conversely, the thermodynamic effect—a result of increased maximum potential intensity in a warmer climate—would yield tropical cyclone genesis patterns that are opposite to the model projections. These findings suggest that dynamic changes in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are an important factor in determining the response of tropical cyclones to global warming. Most previous studies project decreases in global tropical cyclone genesis frequency. Specifically, the projected decreases are more significant over the Southern Hemisphere, including the South Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, than the Northern Hemisphere. However, recent studies project future increases in the total global tropical cyclone frequency. It is, therefore, critical to try to understand the physical reasons behind the projected changes. Although consensus has not been reached regarding the theory determining global tropical cyclone frequency and the projected future changes, it has been widely accepted that changes in tropical cyclone genesis depends on the changes in the large-scale environmental conditions of the atmosphere and ocean.

Air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) are coemitted along with carbon dioxide (CO2) from the combustion of fossil and biofuels used in energy production. Secondary pollutants like ozone and additional secondary PM are formed when primary pollutants are photolyzed by sunlight and oxidized in the atmosphere. Together, these pollutants not only cause an increase in mortality, respiratory distress, cancer rates and adverse effects on cardiovascular systems, but also damages crops and shunts plant growth. Thus, a reduction of air pollution in cities can reduce the number of premature deaths, improve the life of millions of people and mitigate climate impacts of CO2 emissions.

Credit: NOAA Research Atmospheric aerosols can impact climate by scattering or absorbing solar radiation or through water uptake and cloud formation that is determined by the size, composition or phase of the particles. With a rapid loss of sea ice, the Arctic atmosphere is subjected to more gas and aerosol emissions from the open waters, impacting cloud nucleation and warming the atmosphere. Particle phase is dependent on atmospheric conditions like relative humidity and temperature and can impact the uptake of water and other trace gases. A new research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and funded in part by CPO’s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) program demonstrated the presence of solid organic-coated ammonium sulfate particles at high relative humidity in the Arctic boundary layer. The researchers discovered that ammonium sulfate particles, which should have been liquid, were solid. Solid aerosols have the potential to change how clouds form, and with a loss of Arctic sea ice, researchers expect to see more of these particles impacting cloud formation and climate.

One such location is the last frontier, the state of Alaska. Although topography complicates the pattern of these changes in Alaska, the amplified warming and general increase in precipitation are already apparent in observational data. This begs the question, how will precipitation change with future warming? Snow is a high-impact environmental variable, with effects on transportation, infrastructure (e.g., snow loads on buildings), water supplies, vegetation, and air temperature.With snow cover having a profound effect on the economy and ecosystem, changes in snow cover are societally significant.

Credit: NOAA/NREL As electricity providers increasingly add renewable energy to their portfolio, a new study shows that more accurate wind forecasts generated by a NOAA weather model is saving the utilities, and hence the consumers, big money. While wind is abundant, it is also intermittent. Utilities need accurate wind forecasts in order to gauge electricity production - and to determine when they need to generate or purchase energy from other sources when winds abate. Poor forecasts can cost a utility a lot of money, and those costs are then passed on to consumers. Accurate forecasts, however, can result in more efficient generation management and substantial savings. But it's not always clear what those savings are. A study published by the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, economists and scientists from Colorado State University and NOAA’s Global Systems Laboratory puts a number on just how impactful NOAA’s HRRR model has been.

Credit: Wikipedia Pollution in urban centers has historically been dominated by combustion-related sources of emissions, like motor vehicles, but recent air quality research demonstrates that emissions from combustion-related sources are declining while non-combustion-related emissions are increasing from sources like volatile chemical products (VCPs). This trend is evident in data from certain types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are emitted in vehicle exhaust as well as household products and commercial or industrial applications. These complex non-combustion-related sources include chemicals used for construction materials, solvents, paints, consumer and hygiene products, and petroleum-derived products. They increasingly impact urban air quality as primary pollutants and as reactive precursors to secondary air pollution. In general, organic compounds and VOCs are precursors to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and ozone, which are created in the atmosphere instead of being emitted directly. More studies on non-traditional pollutant sources are being conducted, and findings indicate that mitigating these sources is increasingly important for improvement of urban air quality.

Within days, a collaborative, highly-trained, rescue team conducted a survey of surviving corals and rescued 43 colonies from the remaining portions of the wall, focusing on collecting endangered species and species susceptible to Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease, which rapidly destroys the tissue of important reef-building corals.

Credit: NOAA Multidecadal variability of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been reconstructed by various proxies, simulated in climate models, and linked to multidecadal Arctic salinity variability. However, the mechanisms of the multidecadal AMOC variability and its two-way interaction with the Arctic salinity anomaly, as well as the factors affecting the periods and amplitudes of the multidecadal AMOC variability are not well understood from the theoretical perspective using simple conceptual models. Stommel’s Two-Box Model provides a pioneering and powerful theoretical framework to study the mechanisms of steady AMOC states and abrupt AMOC changes. However, Stommel’s Two-Box Model itself does not include a self-sustained multidecadal AMOC oscillation solution. In this study, the authors revise Stommel’s Two-Box model by considering the delayed oceanic advective time lag for the Arctic density/salinity anomalies to reach the subpolar North Atlantic and the dependence of the freshwater flux entering the Arctic on the AMOC strength. The revised Stommel’s Two-Box Model is able to obtain the AMOC delayed oscillator at multidecadal timescales and suggests the important role of the Arctic salinity anomalies and associated delayed negative feedback in the multidecadal AMOC variability. The regimes and multidecadal periods of the AMOC delayed oscillator depend crucially on the advective time scale of the Arctic signal reaching the subpolar North Atlantic. The AMOC-related coupled freshwater feedback provides additional delayed negative feedback and reduces the threshold of the advective time delay needed for the multidecadal AMOC oscillations.

Credit: Trish H-C on unsplash.com A recent MAPP-funded study investigates the causes of a recent multi-year period of decreased rainfall in Hawaii that has led to frequent significant drought events. The study makes novel use of the Global Forecast System - NOAA’s primary weather prediction model as one of the models used to determine whether the recent drought conditions are as a result of natural weather-scale variability or the effects of climate forcings. It is one of the first studies to employ the new GFS/FV3, and highlights the utility of NOAA’s weather models currently to investigate broader prediction, projection and attribution research questions. This research displays one way in which climate-oriented science, especially within the context of understanding/simulating extremes, can help test model performance that feeds back to improving weather forecasts. An important part of NOAA’s mission is to improve the ability to explain and predict climate extreme events. In this study, we see the link between attribution efforts and understanding predictability and prediction system performance. Understanding the cause of the low wintertime rainfall in Hawaii can help improve the fidelity of rainfall simulations in the region. Without proper attribution, it is difficult to assess the efficacy of models with respect to their representation of how weather and climate responds to natural and climate change. The study’s inability to attribute the low rainfall amounts in Hawaii to predictable climate variability sources or longer-term climate change drivers also demonstrates that not every event has an apparent and simple “first cause”–natural weather mechanisms are demonstrated to be powerful in yielding extreme events and trends over considerable periods. The study highlights the importance (and difficulty) of attribution to improve understanding of causes and predictability. These issues are at the forefront of the developing rapid attribution efforts carried out by PSL, GFDL, CPC, and NCEI, and funded by CPO’s CVP, COM, MAPP, and Assessments programs.

Credit: NOAA Population aging and economic development setbacks may outpace the health benefits of less air pollution and slowed climate change, according to a Penn State-led researcher team examining air quality and the factors most likely to impact future premature deaths. The team used past and projected data to model five future scenarios estimating premature deaths due to air pollution and identified areas of the world that could be the most impacted. They published their findings today (Oct. 24) in the journal Nature Sustainability. “When we think about the pollution impacts on future populations, exposure to ambient particulate matter — or air pollution — caused by fossil fuel emissions, is the greatest threat to global health,” said principal investigator Wei Peng, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in the Penn State College of Engineering and of international affairs in the Penn State School of International Affairs. “The health burden is unevenly distributed across countries and disproportionately borne by the global south. To make credible projections of future global health, we created an integrated modeling framework that combines air quality simulations with macro-level sociodemographic drivers like global population and economic development.” Read more at the link below.

Credit: NOAA Heat extremes are the number one weather-related cause of death in the United States, prompting the climate community to study the driving forces behind these extreme events to improve their prediction. A new study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research finds an increase in summertime heat wave occurrence over the US Great Plains is linked to a larger than normal tropical Atlantic warm pool. The Atlantic warm pool is a large body of warm water in the low latitudes of the North Atlantic, which includes the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and western tropical North Atlantic. Using observational data and model simulations, this study finds that the year-to-year variability of the tropical Atlantic warm pool influences heat wave occurrence over the US Great Plains during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months (June – September). This study, led by NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, and Mississippi State University’s Northern Gulf Institute, finds that a larger than normal Atlantic warm pool influences atmospheric circulation patterns over the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, promoting a “heat dome” pattern over the Great Plains.

The findings may help to establish testing and treatment methods to prevent further spread. According to lead author Micheal Studivan, an assistant scientist at the University of Miami Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), the presence of stony coral tissue loss disease, or SCTLD, has been associated with ship ballast water, where ships take in water for stability at one port and release it at another port. To test whether or not this practice has played a role in the rapid spread of SCTLD, scientists at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School and NOAA AOML conducted two disease transmission experiments at the Experimental Reef Lab (ERL). These experiments used Ultraviolet (UV) treatment of ship ballast water to see if the disease pathogens could be transported this way, and whether UV treatment of this water could prevent the spread of this disease.

Recent advances in high-performance computing and the number and quality of observations have led to the development of high-resolution ocean reanalyses, which offer an opportunity to investigate coastal ocean variability with enhanced detail. In a new Progress in Oceanography article, MAPP-funded authors Dillon Amaya, Michael Alexander, James Scott, and Michael Jacox evaluate and compare the ability of three high-resolution ocean reanalyses; the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulations (GLORYS), the Ocean Reanalysis System version 5 (ORAS5), and the California Current System Reanalysis (CCSRA), to accurately represent ocean temperature and salinity (from the surface to the bottom), sea surface height, and mesoscale activity in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME).

Indigenous research sovereignty is research implemented by Indigenous people, upholding their tribally specific knowledge. The importance of this sovereignty and ethical collaborations is preceded by natural resource science and management policies of non-locals making decisions for communities without the contexts necessary for effective management. An example of such policies is fire suppression excluding prescribed fires issued by the federal state agency. This suppression results in the accumulation of fuel on the forest floor that can result in more catastrophic events in comparison to Indigenous fire-management that include low-intensity fires to remove such fuel.

Aiming to improve coral restoration efforts, this new user-friendly framework has been created as a helpful tool for coral reef scientists and managers to address the increasing vulnerability of these vital ecosystems. A carbonate budget is a form of quantitative measure of the net carbonate production in a given reef environment. Carbonate production is a vital tool that corals possess as it essentially builds their internal skeleton, allowing corals to build entire reefs. Each coral polyp, which is an invertebrate organism, secretes this skeleton forming material, known as calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate helps reefs survive and thrive, but it is also what is easily broken down by increasingly warm and acidic ocean conditions. Ocean acidification occurs primarily as a product of increased amounts of carbon dioxide being absorbed by our oceans. This increased absorption of carbon is due to the burning of fossil fuels and lowers the pH of ocean water, making it more acidic. This acidity makes it hard for corals to form their calcium carbonate skeletons, halting the formation of reef building corals. Warmer waters also cause the symbiotic algae organisms known as zooxanthellae to expel from the corals, causing them to bleach. Read more at the link below. Click to read the full article",

But what happens when the sun goes down? As it turns out, the chemistry of air pollution at night is much less well understood, even though it primes the atmosphere for what happens the next day. To date, only a limited number of modeling studies have assessed how the production of ozone and particulate matter is influenced by nighttime atmospheric chemistry, said Steven Brown, a researcher with NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory. Together with researchers in China, Brown helped develop a new analysis method scientists can use to assess the influence of nighttime atmospheric chemistry on air quality around the world. “We hope this work will lead to further research that explores how air quality and climate are affected by what happens when the sun goes down,” said Brown.

Credit: NOAA For the first time, an international research team compiled a set of best practices to assess and report ocean acidification trends. Standardized procedures for measuring ocean carbon chemistry are already largely established, but a common set of best practices for trend analysis are missing. These best practices will facilitate ocean acidification comparison of trends across different regions. They also allow the research community to establish enduring accurate records of change that communicate the current status of ocean acidification to the public. Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, causing a fundamental chemical change. The global rise in ocean acidity is fueled by human-emitted greenhouse gases. The global ocean has absorbed approximately 620 billion tons of carbon dioxide (~25%) from emissions released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. Impacts from ocean acidification will vary by region. In order to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies, managers need an accurate and comparable understanding of how ocean acidification progresses globally, regionally and locally. This requires standardized procedures at all levels of data collection, dissemination, and analysis. Read more at the link below. Click to read the full article",

Credit: NOAA AOML A heat-tolerant algae found in some tropical Pacific corals can make reefs more resilient to heatwave events, according to an exciting new discovery reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers with University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (UM-CIMAS) and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) examined four decades of temperature, coral cover, bleaching, mortality data from three mass bleaching events, and symbiont community data from the last two. Scientists found that a symbiont algae helped corals better tolerate heat stress, increasing their resilience to warming ocean temperatures. Global warming is causing the loss of coral reefs worldwide, as a result of heat-induced coral bleaching and mortality. However, some coral reefs exposed to temperature-induced bleaching develop tolerance to subsequent events, possibly due to changes in their symbiotic algae communities. Over the past 40 years, scientists from the University of Miami, NOAA, and partners have been monitoring reefs in the eastern tropical Pacific region, culminating in an interesting discovery.

Credit: Mia Hoogenboom/ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies The Modeling Analysis Prediction and Projections program (MAPP) of NOAA’s Climate Program Office (CPO) coordinates the Marine Ecosystems Task Force (METF) which brings together scientists to collaborate on MAPP-funded marine ecosystems-related projects. Recently, one of the undertakings of the METF was to properly define marine heatwaves by taking into account the nonstationarity of climate. This effort culminated in a nature commentary that addresses the need for clearer definitions that properly capture the changing nature of our climate and the shift to warmer conditions. Due to the long-term trends in Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs), the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves have increased, and marine heatwaves definitions based on thresholds that do not account for this “shifting” baseline may no longer accurately reflect the nature of extreme warm events driven by internal processes. The distinctiveness of individual Marine Heat Wave (MHW) events has declined as SST warming in many regions is becoming comparable to the magnitude of MHWs. Studies have shown that there is a significant shift in the distribution of sea surface temperatures as a result of climate change which is expected to become even more pronounced as climate continues to warm, with serious implications for marine ecosystems.

Credit: NOAA GFDL Schematic representation of processes encapsulated in the mechanistic sea-spray generation function. Credit: NOAA GFDL Bubbles bursting at the ocean surface are an important source of sea spray aerosols. They contribute to atmospheric aerosols and play a crucial role in radiative and cloud processes. Uncertainties related to the large range of scales involved, and the complexity of the processes, leads to open questions about the dependencies on wind speed, ocean wave properties and water temperature. The authors propose a new mechanistic sea spray generation function for climate models that takes into account the sea-state, wind, and temperature variability to address this challenge. This approach naturally integrates the role of wind and waves via the breaking distribution and entrained air flux, and a sensitivity to temperature via individual bubble bursting mechanisms. The resulting sea spray generation function does not require tuning to match any existing data sets, in terms of magnitude of sea salt emissions and recently observed temperature dependencies. The approach is physically based, using the physics of bubble bursting. The remarkable coherence between the model and observations of sea salt emissions strongly supports the mechanistic approach and the resulting sea spray generation function. Knowledge of the size distribution of primary sea spray aerosol particles and its dependence on meteorological and environmental variables is necessary for modeling cloud microphysical properties and the influence of aerosol on radiative processes. Currently, the extent and brightness of marine low clouds are poorly represented in Earth system models, and the response of low clouds to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols remains a major source of uncertainty in climate projections.

As part of the President’s Investing in America Agenda this initiative will support communities and people on the frontlines of climate change, dedicating nearly $400 million specifically for Tribal priorities and benefiting coastal and Great Lakes communities nationwide with an emphasis on environmental justice. Additional investments from the IRA will improve weather and climate data and services, support the Biden-Harris Administration’s America the Beautiful conservation initiative and strengthen NOAA’s fleet of research airplanes and ships that are used to study and collect data about the ocean and atmosphere. “Under President Biden’s leadership, we are making the most significant direct investment in climate resilience in the nation’s history,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “As part of our more than $2.6 billion investment in regional coastal resiliency and conservation projects, we will be dedicating $390 million directly to Tribal priorities for habitat restoration and bolstering fish populations, and supplying crucial funding to ensure our coastal communities are better prepared for the effects of climate change.” The historic $2.6 billion investment in climate resilience and coastal communities will help ensure communities, especially Tribes and vulnerable populations, have the resources and support needed to prepare, adapt and build resilience to weather and climate events as well as strengthen workforce development, marine resources, nature-based solutions, conservation, regional partnerships and Tribal priorities. The IRA funds will complement the investments already outlined in the nearly $3 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funding, including the $562 million in Climate-Ready Coasts awards announced in April.

Credit: Ana Palicio-Castro/NOAA AOML Two months after MAPP’s Marine Ecosystem Task Force published a comment in Nature calling for clearer definitions of marine heatwaves, a newly published article in Frontiers assesses marine heat waves in the Mediterranean Sea and questions the usefulness of fixed or moving baselines. A marine heatwave is a period of extreme ocean temperatures (90% percentile above normal temperatures). But here’s where the debate begins, what is ‘normal’? On one side, ‘normal’ refers to variations in water temperature for a given area and time of year, based on a set period in the past. Conversely, a shifting baseline of ‘normal’ conditions is used. It accounts for long-term ocean warming separately and subtracts that from the total. Each definition results in different interpretations of the frequency, intensity, duration, and spatial extent of marine heat waves. While both definitions, fixed and shifting baselines, have merits, scientists suggest only using the term ‘marine heat wave’ with the shifting baseline, and using ‘long-term temperature trends’ to describe changes in ocean temperature that occur over decades or longer.

However, the response of tropical forests to more frequent weather extremes and long-recovery disturbances like fires remains uncertain. Analyses of field data and ecological theory raise concerns about the possibility of the Amazon crossing a tipping point, leading to catastrophic tropical forest loss. In contrast, climate models consistently project an enhanced tropical sink. The authors bring these two bodies of work together by analyzing recent trends and future projections of tropical forest biomass and fire carbon emissions using GFDL-ESM4.1, a fully coupled global climate and carbon cycle model. Experiments with this model accounted for the simultaneous effect of fires, water stress, and plant competition. The results showed a heterogeneous response of Amazonian carbon stocks. GFDL-ESM4.1 simulates a distinct response of forest carbon stocks across the tropical biome and among climate change scenarios. The model concurs with observations in predicting a larger forest biomass in the Paleotropics (tropical areas of Africa and Asia) than in the Neotropics (tropical Americas) under current climate conditions.

Credit: NOAA Sea level rise is one of the most challenging consequences of global warming. A new collaborative study led by Dr. Denis Volkov from NOAA-AOML and the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies found that Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) induced changes in basin-wide ocean heat content are influencing the frequency of floods along the United States southeastern coast. The meridional overturning circulation is a system of ocean currents that moves heat, salt, freshwater, and other properties around the Earth and throughout the global climate system. There is a surplus of heat in the tropics relative to the poles due to incoming solar radiation. The ocean, specifically the AMOC, plays a key role in transporting this heat to the subpolar North Atlantic, thus regulating global and regional climate, weather, and sea levels. As polar ice sheets continue to melt and ocean warming intensifies, sea levels are projected to rise by over half a meter by the end of the century. Due to oceanic and atmospheric conditions, sea level changes vary by location, with some regions rising much faster than the global average. The U.S. east coast has been identified as a hotspot for accelerated sea level rise in the North Atlantic. Click to read the full article",

Captain Vassili Pugatsov and the crew of the M/V Bulk Xaymaca, in cooperation with the Argo Float Group at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, deployed these ocean observing instruments, known as Argo floats, in early August during a southbound transit from Louisiana to Jamaica. The floats will add to the global Argo array and enhance key ocean measurements in a region critical for accurate hurricane forecasting. The M/V Bulk Xaymaca is a 225-meter-long dry bulk carrier owned by Pangaea Logistics Solutions and operated by Seamar Management S.A. Argo floats are one of the key tools scientists use to collect ocean information, particularly in remote areas. Argo floats are robotic and dive 2,000 meters, or 1.2 miles below the sea surface, capturing temperature, pressure and salinity data that is transmitted to satellites upon their return to the surface every 10 days. In each of these cycles, a profile snapshot of ocean conditions is collected and made available to researchers globally within hours. Ocean observations and data collected from the Argo array are routinely used in climate reports such as the IPCC and serve as one of the foundational methods for measuring ocean heat.

Credit: U.S. State Department Caribbean Islands, which often receive daily rainfall, are especially vulnerable to flash droughts . Credit: U.S. State Department While much research has focused on flash droughts in various regions, tropical environments have largely remained understudied. This oversight is significant because these areas are accustomed to frequent, near-daily precipitation, making them susceptible to sudden and severe drying. Nowhere is this vulnerability more evident than in the Caribbean. With many islands having limited access to freshwater reserves, this leaves them exceptionally vulnerable when rapid drying events occur. In the face of a flash drought, these islands often struggle to meet the water demands of their populations, agricultural sectors, and ecosystems. In a new Journal of Hydrometeorology, authors Craig Ramseyer and Paul Miller fill the gap in understanding tropical flash droughts by examining their prevalence in the pan-Caribbean region using the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI). The EDDI identifies instances of widespread flash drought “outbreaks” in which substantial portions of the Caribbean experience rapid drying over a 15-day period and sustain this condition for an additional 15 days.

Most buoys must be pulled out and carefully stored away in winter to avoid damage, most research ships are not built to break through the frozen water surface, and older precision instruments were not able to operate at low temperatures. But over the last few years, NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory has been working to develop new tools that may provide a fresh glimpse into the season. “These new tools, built with some of our industry partners, may finally help us close the knowledge gap about winter,” said Steve Ruberg, who leads NOAA’s Meteorological Real-Time Coastal Observation Network. “Information about the biological processes happening in the cold season may help us better understand some of our most important fisheries and prepare for summer events such as harmful algal blooms.” Click to read the full article",

OH reacts with certain air pollutants and greenhouse gases, breaking them down to help maintain air quality. However, difficulties in directly observing OH responses to climate and uncertainties in models make it challenging to predict OH changes. Climate warming, emissions, and human choices contribute to this complexity. Moreover, in a warmer climate, OH concentration in the atmosphere will increase primarily because of its dependence on water vapor. To confidently project OH, scientists need to reduce uncertainties in reactions, measurements, and emissions. Click to read the full article",

Credit: NOAA/Tyler Christian A groundbreaking new study spanning more than a decade and hundreds of miles of the Florida Coral Reef demonstrates the key role benthic communities play in reducing the impacts of climate change on coral reef ecosystems, specifically Ocean Acidification. As the ocean accumulates more carbon from the atmosphere, it becomes more acidic, a process known as Ocean Acidification. A more acidic ocean makes it harder for corals and other marine organisms to build their calcium carbonate skeletons and shells. However, scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) have found that ocean acidification near the Florida Coral Reef varies both geographically and over time, resulting in reef areas that may be less affected by acidification compared to reefs in the open ocean. In many regions globally, the effects of ocean acidification on coastal ecosystems are compounded by localized changes in water chemistry that are harmful to key marine ecosystems. While the southernmost reefs in the Florida Coral Reef were identified as hotspots for ocean acidification, inshore reefs, particularly in the Upper Keys, proved less vulnerable due to increasing water alkalinity (the opposite of acidity) and the presence of seagrass beds.

Traversing 100 nautical miles of dark ocean with only the lights of stars and deep-sea oil rigs in all directions, the research vessel made its way back to a moored sediment trap located hundreds of meters below the surface.

Credit: NOAA Marine ecosystems play a critical role in the global carbon cycle through the food web regulation of air-sea carbon fluxes and the transfer of particulate matter from the upper oceans to depth. Recent evidence has suggested that the detritus from fishes and gelatinous zooplankton, specifically the pelagic tunicates such as salps and pyrosomes, may have a disproportionate impact on the ocean’s biological pump due to them sinking approximately ten times faster than bulk detritus. These fluxes result in increased sequestration of particulate carbon and nutrients into the deep oceans, but their impact on biogeochemical cycles at depth is poorly understood. The authors investigated the sensitivity of deep ocean carbon, oxygen, and nutrient cycles to fast-sinking detritus from tunicates and fishes. They found that the fast-sinking detritus decreased surface productivity and export, as well as the size of ocean oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). This has not previously been investigated in a global ocean biogeochemical model. For this study, the authors incorporated fast-sinking detritus from pelagic tunicates and fishes into a modified version of GFDL’s ocean biogeochemical model COBALT (GZ-COBALT). These results highlight potential missing gaps in the representation of the ocean’s biological pump, and how incorporating previously under-studied mechanisms for fast transfer efficiency of detritus may improve model representations of OMZs and water column denitrification.

While their initial prediction was incorrect, it marked the beginning of a journey toward understanding and predicting one of the most influential climate phenomena on Earth. So, what is El Niño and why is it so important to anticipate the timing of the cycle? ENSO is a climate phenomenon made up of two states, or phases: “El Niño,” and “La Niña.” When the planet is not in either phase, it is said to be “ENSO-Neutral.” On average, El Niño and La Niña occur every 3-7 years and each phase lasts about 9-12 months. ENSO is a coupled climate phenomenon, so there must be changes in both the ocean and atmosphere. If only one appears to be in El Niño or La Niña, the tropical Pacific ocean is ENSO-Neutral.

Credit: NOAA There is a growing awareness that atmospheric river (AR) activities are responsible for a wide range of environmental and socioeconomic impacts on the West coast of the U.S. The related heavy rainfall, snowfall, and associated floods, especially during winter, have been a focus of many previous studies. This research investigates the impact of AR on the Eastern U.S. (EUS). ARs in the EUS remain relatively understudied, despite their frequent occurrence and substantial contribution to heavy precipitation and high-impact weather events. The authors examined wintertime AR frequency over the EUS during the past four decades, using multiple observations and a state-of-art high-resolution climate model (AM4) developed at GFDL. These results show that there is a significant increase in AR frequency over EUS during this period. The increased AR frequency is principally related to the recent changes in the Pacific/North America (PNA) teleconnection pattern, accompanied by a poleward shift of the midlatitude jet stream. Model simulations, using GFDL’s AM4, well capture the observed mean AR and circulation features but fail to simulate their respective trends. Nonetheless, their linkages with the PNA pattern are verified across different realizations, highlighting the critical role of the PNA pattern in regulating the AR variability.

Credit: NOAA Under global warming, changes in the location and structure of the deep convection in the tropics have profound consequences for tropical climate. The tropics are characterized by the ubiquitous presence of high ice clouds formed by detrainment from precipitating deep convection. The bulk of these clouds are so-called anvil clouds in extensive formations that shield the convective centers. These can persist for several hours after the decay of active convection and they carry low to moderate ice loads. The centers of active convection, on the other hand, correspond to a small fraction of the cloudy region and are typically of kilometric scale. Ice loads in the convective centers are very high, reaching tens of kilograms of ice per square meter, and can only be maintained by the strong convective velocities existing at these locations. Changes in ice loading in active convection thus have the potential to shed light on changes of convective velocities with warming. Tropical deep convection is one of the leading sources of uncertainty in future projections of the Earth’s temperature. In particular, there remain major uncertainties in the radiative response of convective clouds, which can have negative or positive radiative effects depending on their optical depth, and on the response of convective velocities with warming. This response, the focus of this paper, is particularly difficult to quantify due to the small scales involved. Click to read the full article",

The AMOC consists of an upper cell and a deep sea or abyssal cell that sits underneath. The upper cell transports warm water from the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean across the equator northward toward high latitudes in the North Atlantic, where it cools, sinks, and flows equatorward as cold deep water. It sits atop a cell of colder, denser water at the ice edge of Antarctica known as the abyssal cell. These waters flow north along the seafloor into the North Atlantic where they slowly rise and mix with other waters that flow back to the south. Together, these cells carry a maximum of 25% of the net global ocean and atmosphere energy (heat) transport.

The weather patterns included non-precipitation days, drizzle, wet non-storm days, and storm days, encompassing events like atmospheric rivers, tropical storms, and mesoscale convective systems. The results show that precipitation days, which include both drizzle and wet days, contribute to about 80% of global longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) CRE due to their high frequency and intensity. Even though storm days are rare globally (only 13%), they collectively contribute to approximately 32% of global LW CRE and 27% of SW CRE because of their stronger impact on both LW and SW CRE.

Unusually high sea surface temperatures, weakened vertical wind shear, and an enhanced West African monsoon are expected to contribute to the development of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. To predict these developing storms, meteorologists employ models that rely on current observations and mathematical calculations to predict a storm’s behavior and track. These models are complex and use inputs from a variety of sources including historic, numeric, oceanic, and atmospheric data to generate their predictions. AOML’s Hurricane Modeling Group has been systematically advancing its hurricane forecasting methods to prepare for this active season. By integrating innovative technology and refining its models, the group’s scientists aim to provide more accurate predictions of storm paths and intensities through innovative advancements in hurricane modeling. The Hurricane Modeling Group specializes in developing and evaluating these experimental and operational hurricane forecast models for transitions from research to operations. Improvements to these hurricane models provide better forecast guidance on tropical cyclone structure, intensity, and track to the National Hurricane Center. Click to read the full article",

Credit: NOAA Droughts figure among the extreme weather events that have increased since the pre-industrial period. Credit: NOAA The occurrence of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and floods, has increased substantially since the pre-industrial period, but this trend has large regional variations. An important driver of the regional climate variability is the zonally asymmetric atmospheric circulation, or stationary waves, forced by the zonal asymmetries in the Earth’s surface such as the land-sea thermal contrast and elevated terrain (e.g., hills and mountains). The authors show that North Pacific wave interference is a useful diagnostic for estimating the magnitude of stationary waves therein, which is tightly linked to North American weather extremes through regulating heat and moisture advection. This research also shows that the spatial structure of these regional impacts is expected to change under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Because stationary waves regulate the poleward transport of heat and moisture and influence storm track strength and location, the projected stationary wave changes in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are key to understanding how regional climate may change in the future. Transient waves, or daily atmospheric circulation anomalies, in midlatitudes can contribute to regional climate variability on intraseasonal time scales through their interference with climatological stationary waves.

Credit: NOAA The Northwest Atlantic Shelf, from the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia to the Gulf of Maine to Newfoundland, has warmed more rapidly than almost any other part of the ocean in the last two decades. This warming has had severe impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Understanding the drivers of this warming and predicting whether it will continue is thus important for mitigating or adapting to future impacts. Global climate models have struggled to accurately predict this warming due to limited resolution. Past regional modeling efforts focused on multi-decadal projections, which are unable to provide information about the next decade because they neglect predictive skill associated with internal variability. These gaps were addressed with the first-ever high resolution ensemble of dynamically downscaled decadal predictions. The downscaled regional simulations accurately predicted past oceanic variability at scales relevant to marine resource management, with skill typically exceeding global coarse-resolution predictions. The authors forecast a temporary warming pause in the next decade, although warming is projected to continue over the long term. The predicted short-term pause is attributed to internal variability associated with a transient, moderate strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and a southward shift of the Gulf Stream.

Beadling Despite being the second-smallest ocean on Earth, the Southern Ocean plays an outsized role in absorbing heat and carbon generated from human activities, accounting for over 40% of the planet’s oceanic carbon uptake and 67%–98% of the global ocean heat uptake. As the climate warms, however, changes to the Southern Ocean’s circulation – caused by stronger, more southerly winds and increased meltwater from the Antarctic ice sheet – could affect its heat and carbon absorption abilities, which in turn would have significant consequences for global temperatures and sea level rise. The authors used two coupled models, CM4 and ESM4, to examine how an increase in and southward shift of the winds over the Southern Ocean, as well as the continued melting of the Antarctic ice sheet, would alter the physical properties and circulation of the Southern Ocean, using a preindustrial control background state to isolate the response. The two models have different representations of the Antarctic Slope Current (ASC), which moves water westward along the Antarctic continental slope and plays a major role in the exchange of ocean properties, including heat, between the continental shelf and the rest of the global ocean. When changes in wind stress and Antarctic meltwater were imposed, both models showed that as meltwater from the Antarctic Ice Sheet enters the ocean, the surface of all parts of the Southern Ocean except for the Weddell Sea cools. The surface of the Weddell Sea, meanwhile, showed limited sensitivity to freshwater from the ice sheet, and instead warmed as a result of changes in wind stress. Click to read the full article",

A new Geophysical Research Letters study used two decades of satellite data to investigate why, examining various components that reflect sunlight, including aerosols, land surfaces, and clouds. The scientists revealed that the Northern Hemisphere’s aerosols and land reflect more sunlight, balanced by the Southern Hemisphere’s low- and mid-level clouds. Observations from the past few decades show that both hemispheres are darkening over time, but it remains uncertain if this change is happening equally.

    "content": "A view down Hurricane Florence. Credit: NOAA The inner core region of hurricanes harbors complex dynamical features, including small-scale clouds characterized by finger-like appearances pointing toward the hurricane eye. These features have been frequently observed in intense hurricanes. However, many basic aspects of these features remain unknown, particularly regarding what controls their occurrence, location, and spatial distribution. The authors conducted a numerical simulation with a very fine (about 100 m) horizontal grid spacing to investigate the nature of these features. Their results reveal a mechanism which explains several key characteristics of these features. The GFDL System for High-resolution prediction on Earth-to-Local Domains (SHiELD), was used to conduct a multi-level nested simulation which has an innermost 125m resolution grid, focused on the hurricane inner core region. The simulation depicts the evolution of an idealized hurricane vortex over a 96-hour period. This is likely the first published effort to use ~100 m grid spacing to simulate the entire vortex intensification period. Click to read the full article",

Scientists recently identified two distinct variations of the Atlantic Niño phenomenon that arise under different conditions, but those mechanisms have been unclear. The Central Atlantic Niño is characterized by warm sea surface temperatures concentrated in the central equatorial Atlantic, while the Eastern Atlantic Niño features warming in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, near the West African coast. A new study published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science used past ocean and climate data, like ocean currents and wind, with computer models to understand how each type of Atlantic Niño forms. The researchers, including Antonietta Capotondi of NOAA’s Physical Sciences Laboratory, found that the Central Atlantic Niño forms when the subtropical waters in the South Atlantic undergo warming. The results show that the Eastern Atlantic Niño is triggered by ocean Kelvin waves, which move across the Atlantic and push warm water deeper below the surface, allowing a build-up of heat near the coast of West Africa.

Credit: NOAA Over the past decade, there has been increasing scientific discussion about the risks and benefits of intentionally cooling Earth’s surface temperature by increasing the reflectivity of the atmosphere. Two methods have emerged as the most potentially viable. One method, stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, involves dispersing microscopic particles between 7 and 30 miles high in the atmosphere to reflect a small portion of sunlight back into space. The other method, marine cloud brightening, or MCB, involves seeding low-level marine clouds with sea salt particles to make the clouds more reflective and reduce the amount of sunlight that can reach the waters below. One well-established characteristic of atmospheric particles is that while they reflect a small fraction of incoming sunlight, a much larger portion of sunlight that is not reflected is largely diffused, or scattered forward in different directions. Now, a new NOAA study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters has found that this diffusion of sunlight from particles in the stratosphere could indirectly make marine clouds thousands of feet below more reflective, or in essence brighter.

    "content": "Wind turbines produce more climate-friendly power than generators based on fossil fuels. But the turbines also produce wakes — ripples, waves, vortices, and other disturbances in the air that can stretch at least a few kilometers long at times. These turbulent wakes can affect power output and cause damage at downwind turbines. Normally, the wakes are invisible to the naked eye, but in the photograph above, they have churned the air over the North Sea into furrows of clouds. This photo fascinates NOAA wind researcher Bob Banta, a scientist at the Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. He and other colleagues who study winds in the lower atmosphere use the picture in PowerPoint talks, scribbling colored lines and squiggles on it to speculate about what is happening where, and why. Why do clouds form downwind of these offshore wind turbines? It’s evident from the haze that the air upwind (in the foreground of the photo) is nearly saturated with water vapor. Maybe when that moisture-laden air hits the turbines, it slows and cools, condensing out water to form clouds. Or maybe, Banta speculates, it’s because the turbulence downwind pulls additional cool, moist air from the ocean surface. Why are the downwind streaks of clouds broader on the right, and narrower on the left? Perhaps the wind speeds in those two areas are different, Banta said, with slower winds on the right. Or maybe it’s due to differences in the temperature of the ocean. “I cannot tell you exactly what’s going on here,” Banta said, pointing to the photograph, “but I can say this is a dramatic, striking example of wind wakes, and this is why the measurements we’re making here in Colorado are so important.” For a study launched this spring at the National Wind Technology Center, part of the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (DOE’s NREL), Banta and colleagues from several institutions used lidars and other instruments to make three-dimensional portraits of wind speeds and directions in the atmosphere up- and down-wind of 130-meter-tall (425-foot) turbines at the wind technology center. The lidar scan data captured the effects of ramp up and ramp down events, when winds suddenly gusted high or died down, and provided data on what happens downstream of the turbine under a wide range of atmospheric conditions. “If turbines are too close to one another, that turbulence can damage turbines downstream, or harm their productivity by reducing the speed of incoming wind,” Banta said. But there are often economic reasons why wind farm operators want to push turbines as close as possible — the costs of power transmission and land, for example.

With less water to evaporate during the long days of summer heat, the landscape gets still hotter. Hotter temperatures accelerate evaporation, drying everything out further. It can be a tough cycle to break. A drought-causing-drought feedback loop is solidly underway across much of the United States, especially in the Southern Plains. The maps above show the drought status in the heart of the country on August 7 (left) and August 14 (right). Conditions range from “abnormally dry” (yellow) to “exceptional drought” (reddish brown). Over the span of a week, a patch of exceptional drought in parts of Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma merged with another patch of exceptional drought that extended from parts of the lower Mississippi River into the Ohio Valley. The area affected by exceptional drought also expanded in Nebraska and Georgia, and extreme drought expanded in New Mexico and southern Texas. A few of the region’s northern and eastern states experienced some lessening of the severity of their drought, including parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. For the contiguous United States as a whole, about 62 percent of the country was in some state of drought, with another 16 percent ranking as “abnormally dry.” The area hit by the worst drought increased from a little over 4% to a little over 6%.

    "content": "Human activities, such as livestock grazing and building, are breaking down desert soil in the Southwest, leaving dusty particles to be swept up by the wind. The wind eventually drops the dust on the snow-capped mountains of the Colorado River’s watershed. In areas where dark dust has settled, the snow turns pink, red, or brown. Snow dusted with dark particles absorbs more sunlight and melts faster than white snow. Scientists conducting field studies in the Rocky Mountains can demonstrate the effect with a simple experiment. They scrape a small area of snow free of dust. When they come back a few hours later, the dusty snow surrounding the clean area has melted faster, leaving an elevated patch of white snow (seen in the photos above). Dusty snow causes earlier melting, particularly in the spring and summer. Plants are uncovered earlier in the growing season, and water that would otherwise flow to the river evaporates from the leaves of growing plants instead. A new study reveals that this phenomenon robs the Colorado River of about 5 percent of its water each year. The lost water amounts to more than 250 billion gallons—nearly twice what the city of Las Vegas uses in a year. Melting snow supplies more than 75 percent of the water in the Colorado River, which in turn supplies water to more than 27 million people in the United States and Mexico. Changes in the timing and amount of snowmelt can exacerbate problems with already limited water supplies. Rising temperatures due to global warming are already leading to earlier melting of the snowpack in the western United States. Reducing soil disturbance in the desert Southwest could help extend the snowmelt season, offsetting some of the Colorado River’s projected water losses due to warming temperatures.

    "content": "Invasive species come in many shapes and sizes; some might even be swimming around in your aquarium right now. But one characteristic that many of them share is that they tend to thrive under a wide range of environmental conditions, giving them an advantage in the face of climate change. In the Great Lakes region, conservation and resource managers are already fending off attacks by multiple invasive species while trying to anticipate what might happen in the future. One of the region’s most prolific invaders from the past several decades is the zebra mussel. Since the arrival of this invasive species, zebra mussels have all but eliminated native mussels by attaching to their shells (demonstrated in the photo above), inhibiting their movement, and competing with them for food. In addition to competing with native mussels, zebra mussels compete with other invertebrates and young fish for plankton, the primary food source for those groups. Fish stocks have declined in many of the Great Lakes because zebra mussels are leaving the fish with fewer food options. The mussels also wreak havoc on ecosystems and infrastructure as large clusters of them cling to the surfaces of boats, pilings, and pipes. Industries that use river water for cooling and other uses spend millions of dollars annually for cleaning intake structures clogged by the mussels. The uncertainty of how zebra mussels will respond to the warming of the Great Lakes due to climate change is a complicating factor in resource managers’ efforts to reduce the harmful impacts of this invader. Based on some initial experiments, some researchers predict that populations of invasive mussels in the Ohio River and farther south could suffer if water temperatures increase. However, more northern populations will probably benefit from climate change and may extend their range to higher latitudes and altitudes. According to the most recent national climate assessment, populations of native species are expected to decline under future climate conditions, although the extent will vary depending on the location and the species involved. Both invasive and native species will try to migrate to new territories where conditions are more suitable. In some cases, today’s invaded may become tomorrow’s invaders. Meanwhile, Sara Grise, a coastal outreach specialist for Pennsylvania Sea Grant, is growing increasingly concerned about new, emerging threats. One way that aquatic invasive species colonize new places is through the release of unwanted aquarium pets or plants into the wild, Grise says. Many aquarium pets are tropical or sub tropical species that could not survive in colder water temperatures if they were released. But that could change as water temperatures warm in some regions. Aquarium species could begin establishing populations in backyard lakes and ponds, and work their way through local water systems. The NOAA Sea Grant College Program is a key player in the Habitattitude campaign, which encourages aquarium hobbyists, backyard pond owners, water gardeners, and others to protect native plants and animals by not releasing harmful plants, fish and other animals into the wild.

Years of monitoring and studying El Niño and La Niña events have helped scientists better understand how these seesawing warm and cool cycles in the tropical Pacific typically influence climate and weather patterns throughout the United States. This information can be particularly useful to farmers and water managers. El Niño and La Niña are particularly influential in the winter. These maps show the difference from average December-February temperature and precipitation averaged over 22 El Niño and 19 La Niña episodes that have occurred in the past 60 years. In the top row, shades of red indicate areas that were up to 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average while shades of blue indicate areas that were up to 3 degrees cooler than average. In the bottom row, shades of brown indicate areas that received up to 2.5 inches less than average precipitation while green indicates up to 2.5 inches more than average. During El Niño events, the easterly trade winds that blow across the tropical Pacific Ocean are weaker than usual and sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific become warmer than usual. An outcome of warmer waters is increased thunderstorms in the eastern tropical Pacific, contributing at times to well above normal precipitation on the West Coast. El Niño events also increase the odds of unusually wet and cold winters across the southern tier of the United States, while the Pacific Northwest tends to experience milder winter temperatures than usual. During La Niña events, the pattern is typically reversed. Sea-surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific are cooler than normal. The polar jet stream tends to shift northward over the central Pacific Ocean, increasing the likelihood of wetter- (or snowier-) than-normal winters in the Pacific Northwest and colder temperatures in much of the western half of the country. The meandering jet stream also typically leads to dry conditions and above-average temperatures in the southern tier of the country.

On the flights, the plane was packed with nearly a dozen science instruments for measuring trace gases and chemicals in the air. The only thing that was missing on the plane? A human pilot. Global Hawk —a 44-foot-long aircraft with a 115-foot wingspan— is not unlike a larger (and much more expensive) version of a remote-controlled toy car or airplane. Global Hawk is guided by pilots sitting in the flight operations room at NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center in California’s Mojave Desert. The plane is designed to fly on its own, following a pre-programmed flight path, but pilots can change its course or altitude if they see interesting atmospheric phenomena in another direction. The airplane flies at altitudes up to 65,000 feet — roughly twice as high as commercial airliners. On its second flight, Global Hawk took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California, flew high above the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Alaska, then southward to Hawai’i, and then eastward back to the base. The flight lasted more than 24 hours and covered almost 9,000 miles. GloPac’s mission is to measure components of the atmosphere that play significant roles in climate change and the depletion of Earth’s protective ozone layer. Scientists and engineers from NASA and NOAA as well as academic and private research institutions have been working together to prepare for the mission for the last 20 months, installing instruments and running test flights to ensure that the devices will work at the low pressures and temperatures encountered at high altitudes.

Warming has been observed even in the bottom-most reaches of the ocean, but most of the heat is accumulating in the ocean’s near-surface layers. The implications of a warmer ocean are considerable. First, because water expands as it warms, ocean heating is responsible for much of the sea-level rise we’ve observed. Further, the ocean will hold the vast amount of heat it has accumulated because it warms and cools much more slowly than air. This makes sense if you’ve ever noticed how much quicker it is to heat the air in a room than the water in a swimming pool — and how much longer the pool holds its heat.

    "date": null,
    "content": "A number of factors cause sea surface temperatures to vary around the globe. For example, the Sun’s rays warm the sea’s surface. Heat energy flows between the ocean and the overlying atmosphere, moving from warmer to cooler. Heat is removed from the ocean when water evaporates from the sea surface. In some locations, winds cause cold water from below the surface to flow upward and cool the sea’s surface. Processes such as these combine to create a dynamic and constantly changing pattern of sea surface temperatures. The ocean contains a huge amount of heat energy. The top two meters of ocean water contain about as much heat as the entire column of atmosphere above them. Thus, ocean currents carry huge amounts of heat around the globe. The atmosphere affects ocean temperatures and currents, and in turn, sea surface temperatures influence weather and climate. The sea’s surface temperature also affects life in the ocean by influencing where and when tiny ocean plants (called phytoplankton) will grow. For all of these reasons scientists monitor the sea’s surface temperature and are working to build better computer models to simulate how its temperature changes over time. In particular, a goal of climate scientists is to model the global three-dimensional ocean, including its surface temperatures, at finer resolutions of space and time to better understand how it influences climate. The colors in this global image (left) represent simulated sea surface temperatures as produced by a new computer model of the global climate developed by NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), in Princeton, NJ. Red areas are the warmest. Orange and yellow shades also show warm surface waters, but growing progressively cooler. Green shows an intermediate value while light blue and dark blue shades show progressively colder waters. The comparison pair of inset images (above right) shows the dramatic improvement in spatial resolution that scientists have made in today’s computer models over earlier models. Such improved resolutions will help scientists better understand the ocean’s roles in the climate system.

The mostly dry weather that prevailed across the month increased the area of the country experiencing drought and the intensity of drought in some locations. The maps show the percent of average precipitation (top) and drought conditions (bottom) across the United States during the month of November. On the precipitation map, shades of brown indicate areas that received less than 100 percent of their average precipitation and shades of green indicate areas that received more than 100 percent of their average precipitation for the month. As the brown areas on the precipitation map indicate, a large area of the country experienced below-average precipitation in November. Drier-than-average conditions stretched from the Intermountain West, through the Plains, into the Midwest, and along the entire East Coast. Twenty-two states had monthly precipitation totals ranking among their ten driest. The drought map shows the different classifications of drought across the country. Abnormally dry areas are those that are going into drought or coming out of drought with some lingering impacts. Moderate drought areas are those with some damage to crops and developing or imminent water shortages. Severe drought areas are those with likely crop or pasture losses and imposed water restrictions. Extreme drought areas are those with major crop or pasture losses and widespread water shortages and restrictions. Exceptional drought, the highest drought category, areas are those with exceptional and widespread crop or pasture losses and water emergencies. According to the November 27,",

    "date": null,
    "content": "Every year, adult Hawaiian green sea turtles migrate to the same beaches where they hatched to breed and lay their own eggs. Ninety percent of these slow-moving swimmers return to nest on the beaches of French Frigate Shoals. French Frigate Shoals is a group of small islands that are part of an atoll — a coral reef that encircles a shallow central lagoon — located in the chain of Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument encompasses most of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, making it one of the largest Marine Protected Areas in the world (see map). Most of the adult turtles spend their time feeding in the main Hawaiian Islands. When nesting season approaches, they migrate over 800 km (500 miles) to French Frigate Shoals. Occasionally, the turtles face obstacles. For example, the cliff seen in the bottom right photo was formed by an eroding shoreline on Lisianski Island. This is a formidable barrier for turtles trying to move across the beach to find a safe place to nest. Sometimes the turtles need a little help navigating the beaches. The turtle in the top photo was attempting to nest on Tern Island. The turtle got stuck in the remains of an old metal sea wall and was unable to get back to the water. These scenarios occur several times during each nesting season, so field biologists stationed on Tern Island conduct daily morning walks to rescue entrapped turtles. The turtles are coaxed onto a “stretcher” and returned to the water. While coastal development, sea walls, and other protective barriers cause big problems for sea turtles in developed areas of the world, they are only occasionally troublesome for turtles nesting in the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Of more concern in this area is the fact that scientists are projecting 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24 inches) of sea level rise by the end of this century due to rising global average temperatures. Many of the Northwestern Hawaiian islands have low, flat coastal plains, as seen in the bottom left photo. They are already vulnerable to storm surges, and they could be totally inundated as sea level rises. In particular, French Frigate Shoals and Pearl and Hermes Atoll are currently less than 2 meters (6 feet) above sea level. Rising sea levels reduce the beach area on these islands, and could eventually submerge them. It’s happened before: in the",

More acidic water can corrode minerals that many marine creatures rely on to build their protective shells and skeletons. How severely marine life will be affected depends on whether and how much we reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. The maps above show computer model simulations of present-day ocean pH (left) and two possible futures: one in which we quickly and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions (middle), and one in which we do not (right). Since the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean has already decreased from its historical global average of around 8.16 (slightly basic) to about 8.07 today.

As a result, the ocean is absorbing increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. However, as carbon dioxide enters the ocean, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid. Subsequent chemical reactions end up reducing the amount of calcium carbonate—a component in the skeletons of many organisms such as corals, lobsters, clams, and pteropods. Without calcium carbonate, these organisms cannot properly grown and reproduce. The three maps show model data of how the availability of calcium carbonate is predicted to decrease over the next century at a depth of 10 meters in the ocean—where most corals occur. Blue indicates surface waters are sufficiently saturated with calcium carbonate; organisms have enough material to build their protective shells. Areas that are deep red are expected to be sufficiently acidic to dissolve shell-building organisms. Before the Industrial Revolution, most areas of the ocean had enough calcium carbonate to support coral and other organisms. However, all areas are predicted to decline by the year",

Their goal is to better understand the role of clouds in the rapid warming observed across the Arctic region. Shupe, of NOAA and CIRES, the University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, has teamed with David Turner of the University of Wisconsin, and Von Walden of the University of Idaho on a project called “ICECAPS: Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit.” Shupe and a team of scientists and technicians are spending most of May and part of June living and working at the research camp at Summit, Greenland. There, they are striving to learn more about clouds, precipitation, and atmospheric structure, all of which are poorly understood over the Greenland Ice Sheet. Among other things they hope to learn from their observations, the researchers want to know the relative amounts of ice being added to the ice sheet by deposition of frost, production of ice crystals from supercooled liquid clouds, and snowfall that drops during storms. The photos at right provide some insight into daily life for Shupe and other scientists at Summit. Some days at the camp, the air sparkles with “diamond dust” ice crystals, swept around by the wind. Other days, fog sweeps through the camp, leaving a coating of feather-like ice crystals on exposed surfaces. The research team conducts their daily work in the Mobile Science Facility, which was built on skis so that it can be moved from time to time to avoid being buried in the snow. At night, residents retreat to tent city to sleep in yellow tents they call ‘Arctic Ovens,’ so named for their ability to keep occupants warm in subzero temperatures. Shupe is blogging about his work at the summit camp. He has written about the challenges of installing instruments, living in a tent city, and doing yoga in Carhartt pants. The ICECAPS project is funded by the National Science Foundation as part of the Arctic Observing Network, an effort to expand understanding of Arctic climate change. Additional support for the project comes from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, the Department of Energy, and Environment Canada.

The BAO tower, nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower, is studded with instruments that help scientists understand the atmosphere, weather, and climate change. The photo at top right was taken from a vantage point 100 meters up, where the tower offers a unique view of the northern Colorado Front Range in the background. The tower’s wind, temperature, and pressure instruments are in the center of the photo. Atmospheric sensors on the BAO Tower are located at the surface, 10 meters, 100 meters, and 300 meters high. This arrangement enables NOAA to gather data on conditions throughout the boundary layer, the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere. Tower instruments also measure the abundance of various chemicals and collect air samples for later analysis in the lab. These measurements help researchers monitor levels of carbon dioxide, other gases, and some air pollutants. The three-dimensional distribution of gases and particles measured by the tower supplies important information for understanding what happens to emissions from automobiles, industry, and natural sources. For example, measurements of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, collected at the BAO tower and at seven similar towers across the country feed into NOAA’s Carbon Tracker system. Carbon Tracker is a sophisticated model designed to help policy makers, industry leaders, and the public better understand the dynamics of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so they can make more informed decisions regarding their emissions of this greenhouse gas. ESRL scientists are especially interested in where carbon dioxide is being emitted into the atmosphere, and where and how much is being absorbed, or sequestered, by terrestrial ecosystems and the ocean.

    "content": "As Earth’s atmosphere and ocean warms, computer models suggest that the Arctic Ocean could be nearly free of sea ice during summers within 30 years. The images above show simulations of sea ice thickness now and three decades into the future. The lightest areas represent the thickest accumulations of ice; progressively darker shades of blue indicate decreasing thickness of ice. The darkest blue represents areas of the ocean that are ice-free and gray represents land. The top images show model simulations that match current conditions for March, when the area covered by sea ice reaches its annual maximum (left), and in September, when the area covered by sea ice reaches its annual minimum (right). Currently, sea ice up to 2.5 meters thick covers the central portion of the Arctic Ocean at the end of winter. After the melt season, as fall begins, much of the sea ice that remains is less than 1.2 meters thick (top right). The bottom row shows projections for three decades into the future. By that time, sea ice in the Arctic Ocean will be less than 2.0 meters thick at the end of each winter (bottom left). At the end of each summer in 30 years, the projections show that sea ice in the Arctic will be very thin or totally absent. Sea ice reflects much of the sunlight it receives back into space. This process helps keep the Arctic region cool and plays a major role in moderating global climate. Over the past 30 years, the area covered by sea ice in the Arctic has shown a dramatic decrease. With less ice present, the dark surface of ocean water absorbs considerably more sunlight energy, leading to further warming of the atmosphere and more melting of ice, which leads to further warming… See the Global Climate Dashboard for an interactive graph and to learn more about trends in the extent of Arctic sea ice.

Hundreds of researchers from across NOAA, NASA, the state of California, academia, and international institutions took to the land, sea, and air to measure and track greenhouse gases and air pollutants. Their scientific goals included understanding the origins of pollutants and greenhouse gases, and the transport, reactions, and eventual fates of those particles and gases. The photos above are taken from NOAA’s WP-3D Orion, one of the world’s premier research aircraft, during a mission flight. The aircraft was outfitted with state-of-the-art instruments to take measurements of gaseous and aerosol species in the air over land and sea. The top photo shows the plane approaching coastal California. The bottom photo shows a view of hazy skies hanging over Los Angeles, often an indication of poor air quality. The scale of the mission was unprecedented for an atmospheric research project in California. CalNex gathered data from four instrumented aircraft, the research vessel, Atlantis, and ground sites in Pasadena and Bakersfield. The intense data collection effort also included releasing ozonesondes from six sites across California, and gathering atmospheric data from more than a dozen radar wind profilers, two tall towers, and more than 100 state air quality sites. A quick look at the data shows that scientists were able to capture simultaneous measurements of air quality and greenhouse gases emitted from California’s agricultural region—including during agricultural burning events. According to David Parrish of NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory’s Chemical Sciences Division, the mission was a great success. CalNex captured detailed information on the transport of some pollutants, particularly ozone, into, within, and out of California. California has well documented air quality problems, and is the world’s 12th largest source of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas that causes global warming. The state has proposed an ambitious program to control emissions of greenhouse gases in future years. Results from CalNex are expected to help decision makers understand a range of complicated atmospheric interactions so they can make informed decisions about new policies that will impact both air quality and climate change.

    "content": "Air trapped in layers of Antarctic snow can give scientists a glimpse of our atmosphere through time. To understand how the atmosphere has changed, university scientists have been collecting samples of this air from compacted snow, called firn, in Antarctica. Analyzing these air samples, a team of researchers recently measured striking changes in the concentration of HFC-23, a greenhouse gas that can trap thousands of times more heat than a similar amount of the better known greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. A century ago, the atmosphere was free of HFC-23; in recent decades, its concentration has risen quickly. The compound, also called trifluoromethane, is a byproduct of an ozone-depleting substance used in air conditioners and refrigerators and for producing heat and chemical-resistant products such as cables and coatings for cookware. At present, the total accumulated emission of HFC-23 is small relative to other greenhouse gases, but as the Montreal Protocol imposes no restriction on some of the processes that generate this compound, scientists are monitoring its presence in the atmosphere. In the last decade, NOAA researchers and colleagues have conducted several field studies in Antarctica, drilling into layers of firn to collect the preserved air samples. In this photo, Andy Clarke, a scientist formerly with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder, holds a core of firn and a canister containing air that was extracted from the firn. He proudly displays the letter “F” on his white suit to signify the group’s nickname—Firnsuckers.

As a reality check on their results they looked for underlying changes in average vertical wind shear that atmospheric physics suggests would be consistent with the latitude shift: stronger shear close to the equator (vertical shear can shred developing storms) and relaxed shear at higher latitudes. The maps show the results of one of their analyses: changes in vertical wind shear across the tropical and subtropical Pacific—the world’s most active tropical cyclone basin—between",

Meanwhile, the Eastern Pacific Ocean—which has been flirting with El Niño conditions for several months—has already spawned 12 tropical storms. As shown in the sea surface temperature image at right, both the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins have areas where surface temperature are above 80°F—high enough to provide energy for tropical storms—but atmospheric conditions have not been favorable for storm development in the Atlantic. The unfavorable atmospheric conditions include strong vertical wind shear, relatively dry air, and a weak West African Monsoon, all of which suppress formation of tropical storms and hurricanes. These conditions are predicted to persist through October. More Information Colors on this map show the temperature of water at the ocean’s surface. The darkest blue shows the coldest water. Progressively lighter shades of blue show increasingly warmer water, up to 80°F. White and orange areas are above 80°F. While heat is mixed and stored throughout the depth of the ocean, it is the temperature at its surface—where the ocean is in direct contact with the atmosphere—that plays a significant role in weather and short-term climate.

According to a new study published in Progress in Oceanography, many of Alaska’s economically and nutritionally valuable marine fisheries are expected to face significant stress as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue to climb. The maps on the right show the risk that ocean acidification poses to Alaska’s fishing industries. The risk index (orange tones) takes into account the hazard of ocean acidification itself—which waters are experiencing acidification and how that is expected to change---how exposed the fisheries are to the hazard, and how vulnerable the area’s human populations are to disruptions to their way of life. The top map also shows the annual commercial value of fisheries in the area, with larger diamonds indicating a larger commercial harvest value. The bottom map indicates regional subsistence fishing levels—when fishermen catch food to feed themselves and their families—in pounds per capita. The larger the circle, the more pounds per capita caught per year. Roughly 120,000 people (or 17 percent) of Alaskans rely on subsistence fisheries for the majority of their dietary protein. Communities in the southeast and southwest sections of Alaska face the highest risk from increased acidification. Not only do Southeast and Southwest Alaska rely heavily on fisheries that are strongly impacted by ocean acidification, which is happening fast in the Gulf of Alaska, but underlying socioeconomic factors, such as low job diversity and lower income levels, also make people in those regions more vulnerable in general. Alaska’s fertile coastal waters are particularly vulnerable to acidification due to a combination of cold water, which absorbs more carbon dioxide than warm water, and ocean circulation patterns that bring naturally acidic deep ocean waters to the surface. Some of the marine organisms in Alaskan waters that are most intensely affected by ocean acidification—such as mollusks and other shellfish—contribute substantially to the state’s commercial fisheries and residents’ traditional subsistence way of life. Also important to the state are its finfish industries, including salmon, which spend part of their lives in freshwater rivers and streams, and part of their lives at sea. Ocean acidification can affect these fisheries by changing the food web. Increasing ocean acidity also impairs the ability of shellfish, corals, and small marine creatures at the foundation of the ocean food web from building skeletons or shells. In the future, ocean acidification is projected to increase in intensity, extent, and duration in the waters around Alaska, further impacting the state’s coastal human communities and the valuable commercial fishing industry, which generates more than $5 billion a year.

    "content": "The Antarctic ozone hole did not cause global warming. But there is a connection between climate and the annual thin spot that forms each spring in Earth’s UV-blocking ozone layer: colder winter temperatures tend to lead to larger ozone holes. The maps at right demonstrate the general connection. The top map shows the average stratospheric ozone concentration from September 8-14, the week when NOAA measurements indicate that ozone hole reached its largest extent for the year. The colors change to red where ozone amounts were less than 220 Dobson Units—the threshold for the ozone hole. The bottom map shows the stratospheric temperature in August (mid- to late winter in the Southern Hemisphere.) Places where temperatures were -78°C or colder are shown in shades of blue. Comparing the two maps, it’s evident that the lowest ozone concentrations are generally where the late winter temperatures were coldest. How is cold related to ozone chemistry? The primary enemy of the ozone layer is free chlorine atoms that come from decaying CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons). The chemical reactions that unleash highly reactive forms of chlorine take place within an unusual kind of cloud. And in the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is, those clouds only form when temperatures drop to -78°C or below. This connection between atmospheric chemistry and climate means that these days (now that production of the longest-lived CFCs is no longer increasing), one of the biggest influences on the size of the ozone hole in any given year is how cold the Southern Hemisphere winter was. It also means that an observed cooling trend in the stratosphere may slow the recovery of the ozone layer. The ozone layer shields life on Earth from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, as well damage plants and phytoplankton, the base of the oceanic food web.

    "date": null,
    "content": "One of nature’s truly awe-inspiring creations, caves and the unique rock formations inside them are not only breathtaking but are also natural recorders of climate. These underground chambers contain the secrets of Earth’s climate in what you may know as stalactites, stalagmites, and other formations. Collectively, scientists call the icicle-shaped rocks hanging from the ceiling and the rock mounds that rise up out of a cave’s floor “speleothems.” It is how these speleothems form that allow them to hold a natural record of climate. As water runs through the ground, it collects naturally occurring minerals like calcium carbonate from the soil. Then, as the water drips down into caves through cracks in the ground, it leaves those minerals behind in crystal deposits that form speleothems—similar to the way water leaves white spots on your bathroom faucet or shower. The speleothems grow over time as the water drips down from the cave’s ceiling, as seen in the top photo taken in Crystal Cave in Spring Valley, Wisconsin, or the water pools in its floor and the deposits build up in thin, shiny layers. Once speleothems stop growing, their smooth, wet-looking surface turns dull as the speleothems become dirty and eroded. The bottom photo shows impressive stalactites adorning the ceiling above Dream Lake in Luray Caverns, Virginia. The formations that appear to be stalagmites below are actually a reflection on the water’s mirror-like surface. The Luray Caverns are millions of years in the making, and the formations continue to grow at the rate of one cubic inch every 120 years. Speleothems often form annual growth rings similar to those found in trees and these may be deposited over hundreds or even thousands of years. Because the amount of water making its way into the caves determines the amount speleothems grow, their layers can indicate times of both heavy precipitation and drought in the area. Paleoclimatologists can also collect other climate information from speleothems by looking at the amount of a particular oxygen isotope they contain. There are two main types of oxygen isotopes in water, and the ratio of the two depends on several climate-related factors including air temperature, precipitation, and the volume of ice sheets in the world. Speleothems preserve this ratio of oxygen isotopes as they form, which also allows paleoclimatologists to use them to reconstruct past climate conditions. A single cave cannot, however, paint the full picture of past climate conditions in an area. So, paleoclimatologists study speleothems from many caves and look for overarching patterns. Additionally, insights gleaned from patterns in speleothems combined with data from other natural recorders like pollen, trees, ice, and corals can help scientists get a true sense of what Earth’s climate was like thousands to millions of years ago.

    "content": "If you grew up without air conditioning near a mountain range, you know that a good way to beat the summertime heat is to head for the hills. But climate change appears to be making mountain air less brisk more quickly than scientists previously thought. Accelerated warming at high elevations could have serious consequences for water supplies and alpine plants and animals. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that high-elevation areas are warming faster than other parts of the globe, but just how much faster—or how much variability exists from place to place—scientists can't say. The lack of certainty about high-elevation warming is down to the worldwide scarcity of high-elevation weather stations. This map illustrates the location and elevation of all stations that are part of the Global Historical Climatology Network in California. The lower elevations around San Francisco (and Los Angeles, visible in the large image) have many stations, while the higher elevations of the Sierras to the east have very few. In a new paper in Nature Climate Change, scientists reviewing the availability of high-elevation climate data wrote that out of more than 7,000 weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network, only 3% are situated more than 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) above sea level, and less than 1% are above 3,000 meters (10,000 feet). Above 5,000 meters (16,000 feet), temperature records longer than 20 years are \"simply nonexistent.\" The long-term weather station records that do exist show a worrisome trend. The weather stations that have been built on the Tibetan Plateau show that over the past 20 years, temperatures above 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) have risen almost 75% faster than temperatures below 2,000 meters (6,500 feet). The location and density of climate observing stations is a function of human settlement patterns. We have more stations, with longer histories, for lower elevations because that is where people live for the most part—near coasts, along rivers, in fertile valleys and plains where agriculture is easier. Mountainous areas are difficult to reach, their harsher weather is tougher on equipment, and they can have many different microclimates from slope to slope. But even if people don’t live there in high densities, mountains are more than just summertime vacation spots. Around the world from California, to New Zealand, to India, mountains are the world's \"water towers.\" For millions of people, mountain snowpack is a nature-made reservoir, with summer releases that keep water flowing to lower elevations at the hottest, driest time of year. In addition to supplying water to millions of people, mountains provide cooler habitat for temperature-sensitive species of plants and animals. High-elevation species that must migrate upslope in a warming climate may soon be left with nowhere to go. This research was conducted by a team of scientists as part of the Mountain Research Initiative, a mountain global change research effort funded by the Swiss National Foundation.

Operating in the tropical Pacific Ocean, ENSO is Earth's singlest most influential natural climate pattern. El Niño and La Niña alternately warm and cool large areas of the tropical Pacific—the world’s largest ocean—which significantly influences where and how much it rains there.

    "date": null,
    "content": "The arrival of El Niño or La Niña in the tropical Pacific Ocean triggers a cascade of changes in tropical rainfall and wind patterns that echo around the globe. For the United States, the most significant impact is a shift in the path of the mid-latitude jet streams. These swift, high-level winds play a major role in separating warm and cool air masses and steering storms from the Pacific across the U.S. These maps illustrate the typical impacts of El Niño and La Niña on U.S. winter weather. During La Niña, the Pacific jet stream often meanders high into the North Pacific and and is less reliable across the southern tier of the United States. Southern and interior Alaska and the Pacific Northwest tend to be cooler and wetter than average, and the southern tier of U.S. states—from California to the Carolinas—tends to be warmer and drier than average. Farther north, the Ohio and Upper Mississippi River Valleys may be wetter than usual. During El Niño, these deviations from the average are approximately (but not exactly) reversed. One or more of these climate patterns have occurred during many El Niño and La Niña events in the past. That doesn’t mean that all of these impacts happen during every episode. Every event is somewhat different. In other words, the influence of El Niño on U.S. winter climate is a matter of probability, not certainty. El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of a natural climate pattern across the tropical Pacific Ocean that swings back and forth every 3-7 years on average. El Niño and La Niña alternately warm and cool large areas of the tropical Pacific—the world’s largest ocean—which significantly influences where and how much it rains there. Like a boulder dropped into a stream, this shift in the location of tropical rainfall disrupts the atmospheric circulation patterns that connect the tropics with the middle latitudes, which in turn modifies the mid-latitude jet streams.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Corals reefs face double threats from rising atmospheric carbon dioxide: severe heat stress and ocean acidification. Severe heat stress causes bleaching (the expulsion of corals’ food-producing algae). Ocean acidification (the drop in seawater pH as the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide) reduces the availability of calcium minerals for skeleton building and repair. The combination of these two threats poses a Catch-22 for coral reefs. In many cases, the longer a reef is protected from severe heat stress, the more time the ocean has to absorb carbon dioxide, and the greater the threat the reef will face from acidification by that point in time. The maps at right show how this relationship is likely to play out in the tropical Pacific, based on modeling research led by scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. The top map shows the year in which heat stress sufficient to cause severe bleaching (8 degree heating weeks) is likely to become a yearly event, causing severe degradation of the reefs and the goods and services they provide. The bottom map shows the projected declines, by that year, in how saturated seawater is with the mineral aragonite, the form of calcium carbonate used by growing corals. Corals close to the equator—such as around the Solomons Islands—are projected to experience potentially fatal levels of heat stress on a yearly basis in less than 15 years with continued high rates of carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, reefs at higher latitudes, such as those around Fiji or Hawaii, may have three decades before they hit that threshold. This latitude-linked pattern is consistent for reefs around the globe. (See global views of heat stress and aragonite saturation state maps.) Meanwhile, the bottom maps shows that increasing ocean acidification will mean there are few safe havens for coral, as rising acidity leads to a steady decline in how saturated seawater is with aragonite. The longer the threat of severe annual heat stress is delayed—in the southern Great Barrier Reef between Australia and New Caledonia, or around Fiji or Hawaii—the more carbon dioxide the ocean will absorb. The more carbon dioxide it absorbs, the lower the pH drops, and the more aragonite saturation declines. In parts of the Southwest Pacific, the saturation state of aragonite may have dropped close to 20% by the time those reefs have begun to experience annual severe bleaching. According to the results, 90% of all reefs in the world will be experiencing severe annual bleaching by",

Warm winters can cause snow droughts in the Sierra Nevada, both by nudging precipitation in the direction of rainfall rather than snowfall, and by melting snow sooner. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Irvine, uses historical records and modeling to understand how the Sierra Nevada snowpack may respond to rising temperatures. Based on the new study, this figure shows how the snowpack could fare in the Sierra Nevada with a 1°C (1.8°F) increase in average winter air temperature. Hydrologists consider the entire Sierra Nevada mountain range, but also divide the range into four regions: Northwest (NW, purple); Northeast (NE, magenta); Southwest (SW, dark pink); and Southeast (SE, pale pink). The study makes multiple estimates for each subregion. A few of those estimates appear here, all for April 1. That date is generally considered the end of the snow accumulation season and the start of the melt season, although the onset of spring melt varies by year and region.

Worldwide and in the United States, these adverse health effects will worsen as climate change continues, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4). If greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, however, thousands of lives could be saved by the end of this century in the United States. This map from Chapter 14 of the report shows projected changes in the annual net mortality due to extreme heat and cold in 49 cities across the United States depending on the greenhouse gas pathway we choose to follow. The map on the left shows the estimated changes in mortality rate over the coming century if the world follows a lower emissions path (RCP 4.5), while the map on the right shows estimated changes in mortality under a higher emissions path (RCP 8.5). Compared to today’s rates, researchers estimate that extreme temperatures by the end of the century will cause an additional 9,300 extreme-temperature-related deaths per year across all 49 cities under a higher emissions pathway or an additional 3,900 deaths per year with a lower emissions pathway. Older residents, young children, low-income communities, and some communities of color face greater health risks due to extreme temperatures. Some cities are better prepared for extreme heat than others. The NCA4 cites Dallas as an example of a city with greater adaptive capacity to the health impacts of extreme heat (e.g. people who’ve lived there for a while can better handle the heat and air conditioning is widely available). If all 49 of the examined cities had adaptations equivalent to those of Dallas, the number of estimated additional deaths for either pathway could be cut in half. Individuals, communities, states, and nations can all adopt strategies to save lives and money. Regions and states can develop risk reduction and response plans to extreme events, monitor infectious disease spread, prepare healthcare infrastructure to withstand climate change, and use short-term to seasonal forecasts in planning. Individual and local adaptations can include altering urban design—such as building more cooling green spaces in cities—and improving water management. The report that reducing emissions and increasing climate resilience will save thousands of lives from the effects of extreme temperatures and save hundreds of billions of dollars, and those numbers are likely underestimated.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Much like archaeologists dig up artifacts to piece together stories of ancient civilizations, climate scientists dig up natural “artifacts” to piece together stories of past climates. From fossil pollen to air bubbles trapped in ice cores, these artifacts, or “proxies,” allow scientists to compare current climate change to the past. This week, NOAA released the most comprehensive database ever assembled of proxies—many available publicly for the first time—that can tell scientists about temperatures since the last ice age ended roughly 12,000 years ago. This animation shows the types of paleoclimate proxies in the database and the 684 sites they came from. Before ending with a map of all the sites, the animation cycles through four maps of the different material from which the proxy came: peat (maroon), partially decayed plant material found in marshy or damp regions; marine sediment (blue), lake sediment (green), and glacier ice (purple). Paleoclimate proxies indirectly record climate and atmospheric conditions present when they formed or grew; air bubbles in ice cores sample past carbon dioxide levels, pollen and undecayed plant matter reveal growing conditions, and the ratio of oxygen isotopes in marine fossils indicate ocean temperatures. Proxies can come from all over the world — from glaciers in Antarctica to the tropical oceans — and compiling them into datasets can help place today’s warming climate into the context of a longer history. Lake sediment sites represent the majority of the data in the new database (50%), while glacier ice sites represent the smallest component (3%). Over half of the sites (51%) are located between 30-60°N, covering the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Central China, Japan, Canada, and Russia, and 16% are in the Southern Hemisphere. Locations and categories with more sites typically reflect a combination of logistical reasons. For instance, lakes are located in more regions than glaciers and, according to the research team, are easier and less expensive to sample. In addition, since land is unevenly distributed between Earth’s hemispheres, there are more lake sites and researchers to collect data in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere. By using records from multiple proxy sources, the scientists were able to cover every continent and ocean for a more complete reconstruction of Earth’s climate over the past 12,000 years. In addition, comparing multiple proxy sources against each other allows scientists to reconstruct a more reliable and consistent story. “These records will help us determine if current warming has exceeded the range of temperature changes throughout the last 12,000 years,” said Carrie Morrill, study co-author and research scientist with the University of Colorado Boulder and NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. And, though our climate today is likely warming more rapidly than it has in the past, studying warm periods captured in the database might point out other consequences of global warming to help society plan for the future. This new database will continue to be updated with new records as they are made available through more research and improved data collection and analysis techniques. It results from a partnership between NOAA’s World Data Service for Paleoclimatology, the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, and a large team of international researchers led by scientists at the University of Northern Arizona, with funding contributions from NOAA Climate Program Office’s Climate Observations and Monitoring Program, the U.S. and Swiss National Science Foundations, the Heising-Simons Foundation, and the Past Global Changes (PAGES) Project.

    "content": "Driving a car in the rain is challenging and dangerous enough. But what if flash floods disrupt traffic and damage roadways? The decision to drive through floodwaters or pursue a safer path is complex. New NOAA-funded research finds that a multitude of cultural and situational factors, including official warning messages, influence motorist decisions in these situations. This cartoon illustrates some of the information and influences, cultural and official, that drivers say influences them as they decide how to handle flooded roads, according to the results of the study. Official signs with messages like “Road May Flood” are influential, as are cultural cues like belief in trucks and SUVs’ ability to safely pass floodwaters. Drivers also seek more information about their environment, such as possible detours. The research team, which was funded by the NOAA Climate Program Office’s Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) program, chose Tucson, Arizona, as the subject of a case study on driver psychology. Tucson’s streets regularly flood during the monsoon season in July and August, and a city program called “Operation Splash” aims to discourage motorists from entering flooded roadways with permanent signs, seasonal A-frame signs, and road barriers. The experts wanted to understand what kind of messages and information would help drivers make the safest decisions, so researchers analyzed data from two focus-group interviews with Tucson flood risk managers and a mail-in survey sent to Tucson residents. Tucson residents were asked to provide their typical responses (what have you done in the past ) or hypothetical responses (what you might do) to encountering a flooded roadway. They responded that the main factors that deter their crossing of floodwaters were (in order of importance): (1) it’s dangerous (risk injury or death) (2) the presence of a barricade or sign and (3) it might damage or destroy the car. Respondents indicated the main incentives for crossing were (in order of importance): (1) the car ahead made it through (2) there is family on the other side or (3) I don’t know another possible route. The study also ranked respondents’ trust in various sources of information on floodwaters. The most trusted sources, in order of influence, were (1) firefighters, (2) environmental cues such as observing other vehicles safely crossing the water, and (3) emergency responders. One of the authors’ primary goals for this study was evaluating the efficacy of public information campaigns, including warnings on signs and city-erected barricades. Results affirm that drivers trust these messages. The presence of water on roads, however, does not always indicate danger, so drivers seek more information before deciding whether to cross floodwaters. For example, they value real-time cues, such as observing another vehicle successfully cross. The study suggests that municipalities should offer more specific official messaging to drivers during floods—such as details on the severity of present danger and directions to alternate routes—to improve driver safety.

    "date": null,
    "content": "If asked where in the United States is most vulnerable to drought, you might point to those states in the West currently suffering under hot and dry conditions and raging wildfires. However, according to a new NOAA-funded assessment, what makes a state vulnerable is driven by more than just a lack of rain: it’s a combination of how susceptible a state is to drought and whether it’s prepared for impacts. And the most and least vulnerable states could surprise you. These maps show each state’s overall drought vulnerability (red) and how it ranks in the three individual categories that make up the score: sensitivity (blue), exposure (yellow-orange), and ability to adapt (purple). Darker colors show higher overall drought vulnerability and a greater degree of factors that increase the state's vulnerability. (For the latest drought status information, visit Drought.gov.) Sensitivity is the likelihood of negative economic impacts, which is based on the percentage of agricultural land, number of cattle, how much the state relies on hydropower, and recreational lakes. The exposure score reflects how often a state experiences drought and what assets, like the number of people and freshwater ecosystems, are at risk when it occurs. The ability to adapt score ranks how well the state can cope with and recover from drought, which depends on whether the state has a drought plan, how equipped it is to irrigate its land, and whether it is financially strong overall. By this scoring system, the most vulnerable states are Oklahoma, Montana, and Iowa, while Delaware, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and California are least vulnerable to drought. Oklahoma gets its high vulnerability score from having an outdated drought plan and limited irrigation (low ability to adapt), as well as extensive agricultural activities and cattle ranching (high sensitivity). Despite facing recurring multi-year droughts (relatively high exposure), California ranks very low in drought vulnerability. Thanks to a strong economy and well-developed adaptation measures, it’s better prepared for an extreme drought when it occurs than most other states. On the East Coast, the region is generally less vulnerable than other areas, given its wetter climate and lack of farming—except for New Jersey. As the most densely populated state in the country (very high exposure), it gets the region’s highest vulnerability score. By breaking down drought vulnerability into three components, this assessment can help decision makers identify what makes their state vulnerable for better planning. And, as the study shows, even states that receive lots of rain can still be vulnerable. Though drought is one of the costliest natural hazards in the United States, there are actions states can take to become more resilient.

    "date": null,
    "content": "More than a dozen U.S. states, close to 150 cities, and more than a thousand U.S. businesses have adopted plans to dramatically reduce their planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. That means cities across the country are asking the same question: what’s the cheapest way to map and measure carbon dioxide emissions? New NOAA-funded research led by Derek Mallia, Logan Mitchell, and John Lin from the University of Utah demonstrated the usefulness of one approach. The team found that deploying mobile sensors on an electrified light rail train, instead of installing stationary sensors, can drastically improve cities’ understanding of their carbon dioxide emissions. In the past, tradition has called for deploying multiple research-grade, costly sensors in different parts of the city. But the first pair of maps illustrates the expanded upwind sampling area, or footprint, that can be mapped by a single carbon dioxide instrument mounted on a light rail train car (right side), compared to the upwind footprint for four stationary instruments at fixed locations (left). Mobile sensors attached to a light rail train car allowed researchers greater insight into the Salt Lake Valley region, including important carbon dioxide sources such as Interstates 15 and 80, downtown Salt Lake City, power plants, and oil refineries. Not only did mobile sensors produce better results than stationary sensors, but they did so at a fraction of the cost. The authors estimate that a single sensor deployed on a light rail public transit platform could gather the same information on carbon dioxide emissions as 30 stationary sensors, saving the city $1.2 million dollars. Creating urban emission inventories like Salt Lake City’s requires a multitude of data streams to be blended in a model. Each data set has its own source of uncertainty. For example, researchers can measure the emissions from the tail pipe of a car, but to estimate emissions from all cars in a city requires knowing (1) how many cars are in a city, (2) knowing when and where these cars are being driven, (3) the age of the vehicle fleet, (4) the types of vehicles, and more. Ideally, real-world observations allow researchers to place upper or lower limits on what they don’t know. The maps show that mobile sensors significantly reduced the uncertainty in model estimates of the city’s emissions—cutting it in half in some places in the Salt Lake Valley. The Salt Lake Valley’s natural boundaries around Salt Lake City make it ideal for studying urban carbon emissions, and analogous urban areas exist. The only condition for selecting a light rail system is that the trains must be electrical and run above ground; otherwise, the train’s own emissions could skew the results. For instance, future studies could examine Denver, Colorado, another urban region with public light rail. Future research could also apply this study framework to air pollutants such as PM2.5—the tiny soot and aerosol particles that are especially dangerous to human health. The research might also encourage cities without light rail to seriously consider other options for mobile sensor deployment.

    "content": "Running time 2:41 Jim Wilczak describes the information NOAA provides to guide optimal wind energy development, as well as the observation technology the Wind Forecast Improvement Project has deployed to improve wind forecasts. Transcript Jim Wilczak, NOAA Earth System Resources Laboratory: One of the core aspects of the Wind Forecast Improvement Project is to show that we are in fact improving the weather forecast models. The whole industry, in a sense, is very much dependent on NOAA’s forecasts and observations, and what we’re trying to show here is that by assimilating these forecasts into models that we’re getting better forecasts out. The type of information that is important for a site before a wind developer will create a new wind plant would be to know what the annual average wind speed is going to be at the hub height where the turbines are. But more importantly than that you also need to know how it varies during the day, from one day to the next and from one hour to the next. The variability of the wind is important. You also need to know what the shear is of the wind across the turbine because if the wind is blowing much stronger at the top blade of the turbine than at the bottom, that can put additional stresses on the turbine, and it can also reduce the amount of energy that’s created. We have a number of different instruments that we’ve installed out in the field specifically for the Wind Forecast Improvement Project and that includes over a dozen sonars and wind profiling radars. And these instruments measure the wind, not just at the ground, but up at hub height and even higher in the atmosphere. And these instruments are being used, most importantly, for providing new information, a new data set that wouldn’t have existed otherwise, that we’re putting into numerical weather forecast models, and using those models then to make a better prediction of what wind energy is going to be available in the next several hours. If you don’t have a good understanding of what the current state of the atmosphere is it’s hard to make a good forecast of what it will be in the near future. So by putting these additional instruments out in the field we’re better able to describe what the current state of the atmosphere is, and therefore we can get a better idea of how much wind energy there will be in the immediate future. The real measure of success to this project is going to be dollars. So, when we can show that the electric utility industry and the wind energy industry can save money, reduce costs to themselves, pass that on to the consumers, and have cheaper wind energy on the system because of the fact that they’ve got a better idea in advance when that wind energy is going to show up, when it’s going to disappear, the final outcome will be cheaper energy for consumers. ___ Links Video (high-resolution version) produced by NOAA’s Environmental Visualization Laboratory.

Transcript Felix Kogan, NOAA Satellite and Information Service: The World Health Organization indicates every minute two children under the age of five die in Africa, affected by malaria. Kids can play in the morning, play soccer, and in the afternoon be severely ill from the malaria. Sometimes people ask me, “How do you see mosquitoes from satellites?” I don’t see mosquitoes from satellites, unfortunately, but I see the environment where mosquitoes are working. I see that mosquitoes like warm and moist environments, and this is what I see from operational satellites. I see how green is the vegetation; if vegetation is green, it means there is enough moisture. If vegetation is green that means that the temperature is very comfortable. If the temperature is too hot, it’s not good for mosquitoes; if it’s too dry it’s not good for mosquitoes. Every week we receive satellite data, and we convert them, we massage satellite data, and we convert them to our indices which indicate if the surface is warm, if the surface is green enough and has enough moisture. We can identify malaria approximately from one to two months ahead of time; we can identify conditions for development of malaria. We can identify malaria intensity. We can identify areas affected by malaria, duration of malaria from our data. We focus first on malaria and first on Africa because Africa contributes a lot of cases of malaria. A lot of people are affected by malaria; half of the world population is affected by malaria. ___ Links Video (high resolution version) produced by NOAA’s Environmental Visualization Laboratory.

What we can see in the Arctic is that it has a fever. As a consequence we look to the reason why there is that change. In the Arctic you have this nice bright white sea ice surface. When that sea ice surface melts away you are losing that surface that helps keep sunlight bouncing back into space and replaces it with the dark ocean that absorbs the temperature, so you begin to get this cycling feed back. You get a little bit of melting of the sea ice cover. It exposes ocean. The ocean warms up, melts more sea ice, and you begin to get an acceleration of that warming signal. We expect temperatures to continue to increase until the end of the 21st Century. ___ Links Related video: The Arctic Report Card: Highlights from",

    "content": "Running time 4:29 Grower Kirk Brock talks about adapting to rainfall extremes on his dryland farm in Florida and how seasonal climate forecasts should help him improve his operation. Transcript Kirk Brock: We got a thousand acres we grow—and it’s all dry land—so we have to consciously think about water. We get rainfall in this area. We get almost 60 inches a year typically. But it’s that time between rainfalls that we’re trying to use cover crops and conservation tillage to mitigate those 30-day periods of dry weather– maybe 14 day periods of drought. Wendy-Lin Bartels: Farmers have always been paying attention to the weather and the climate. It’s what they do. It’s the way that they function. But, a lot of the times it’s in a reactive way, and it’s not so much preparing for it. So now that we have the science information and the climate forecasts we can actually provide that to farmers and they can think about their planting—think about their harvesting—and prepare for that. Kirk: I’m going to use this research data to influence my decisions on my operation to make my bottom line better and my livelihood for my family and our economic viability into the future. We are going to use this research to our advantage. Kirk: Historically, in the farming community here, there was a July and June had more even distribution of rain. The rainfall events were usually one inch, or two inches. But now, in the last 20 years, it seems that our number of four-inch rainfall events has increased, but the time between those rainfall events has expanded. We don’t get a rainfall event more than two inches in conventional farming because anything more than two inches runs down the hill and into the creeks. But with these conservation tillage and heavy cover crops we can harvest a four-inch rainfall event and get it into our soil profile for our cash crop to use. Wendy-Lin: My father was a farmer, and so I grew up on the farm. And I grew up watching him and watching how he learned. And he would learn by paying attention to what was going on around him. Kirk: One particular day in the summer we had, it had rained. It wasn’t much slope, in a field. We had a quarter inch of rain, and the water was already running out of the field. So I made the decision right then we’ve got to go to a system that holds the water in the field to allow it percolate into the soil profile. Wendy-Lin: So that’s when you started the cover crops, and that’s kind of what they do, they hold the water? Kirk: That’s right, we started planting cover crops in the winter to grow and produce biomass– you know, residue– that would be there to help dampen create these little mini dams to hold the water in the field when it did rain. Wendy-Lin: When Kirk looks at the soil he doesn’t just see the earth. He sees the life force for his crop, and so he’s trying to build that life force. Kirk: There is all kinds of life in the soil. Any crop, Wendy, that’s growing, is releasing nutrients– sugars– into the soil that the bacteria and the life in the soil can live off of, and then other life lives off that life, and it’s just a big community in there. I call it life stock in the soil. Wendy-Lin: He’s really a soil and water wizard, you know. He’s trying to cultivate what’s already there in the soil and maintain all those organisms, all those creatures that live inside of the soil. So, by doing that, he reduces his risks that he has to face in farming because he doesn’t have to use as much fertilizer as other farmers do. He doesn’t have to worry about irrigation. In fact, he doesn’t use any irrigation. Wendy-Lin: So you’re feeding the livestock in the soil? Kirk: That’s right, cover crops can help feed the livestock that are in the soil. Wendy-Lin: And the soil feeds the crop. Kirk: And the soil feeds the crop. Wendy-Lin: And the crop feeds us. Kirk: And the crop feeds us. Kirk: This is our homemade cover crop annihilator. Wendy-Lin: Can we go for a ride? Kirk: Yea, c’mon let’s go. Wendy-Lin: Ok! Yea, I’m a little nervous. It’s a big machine. Wow! I’ve never been in an annihilator before. Kirk: Watch your step. Wendy-Lin: O.K. What am I watching my step for? Kirk: I just tell everybody that, hey. Wendy-Lin: O.K. (laughing) Kirk: You can sit right here. Wendy-Lin: O.K. Kirk: On the buddy seat. Wendy-Lin: Wow, you need some windscreen wipers in here. Coming with us? Off camera: I don’t think I can fit in, so… Wendy-Lin: Whoa!

Transcript Deke Arndt Chief, Climate Monitoring Branch National Climatic Data Center So, how are you going to try and wrap up all of the extreme weather in the U.S. into one number? That’s enough to make a grown man cry. The Climate Extremes Index tries to describe climate extremes. Organizing all of those extremes into one index is a challenge. So how do you do that? We start by cutting it into components. Extreme precipitation. Drought. Extreme temperatures. And tropical storms. And you can begin to construct an index for each one of those. So, if you think about any one of those components, let’s use temperature and let’s say we’re thinking about Philadelphia. We take Philadelphia’s temperature record for a given month, say July in Philadelphia, and we sort and line them up from the coolest we put that on a football field from goal line to goal line. What the Climate Extremes Index is, it only counts those observations that occur within the 10-yard line. It just hits on those extremes. And so for Philadelphia, you can look at its record and you can ask, when did these extremes occur? Are most of the warm extremes in recent decades. You get an idea of how those extremes are evolving over time. And once you’re done with Philadelphia you build in neighboring cities, then you build out across the country, and before you know it, you have one for temperature, one for precipitation, one for drought, one for tropical storms and several others to come up with the component index of climate extremes. The reason you track climate extremes, it isn’t just for curiosity’s sake. Just like in a football game, important consequential things happen when you start playing around in the extreme behavior of climate. That’s when big decisions need to be made. The Climate Extremes Index tries to capture that. ___ Help us improve our content",

Transcript Deke Arndt, Chief of the Climate Monitoring Branch, National Climatic Data Center. Tropical Storm Isaac reached hurricane force for three days at the end of August and dropped almost a foot of rain in some areas. It devastated homes and communities as it hovered over the Coastal Plain before it moved up into the Ohio River valley. People in the middle of the United States, who have been plagued by drought for much of the year—they wanted rain, and they needed rain. But how much did Isaac alleviate the drought in this part of the country? Where rain falls and when it falls determines whether drought will persist or diminish. Areas that show up in darker colors here needed a lot of rain, but Isaac didn’t deliver it when or where many farmers needed it. This map shows the percent of normal rainfall that fell across the United States this summer in June, July, and August. The greener colors show that more rain fell in coastal Louisiana, Alabama and throughout the surrounding Coastal Plain. And that’s exactly where Isaac dumped most of its rain. Areas that were already soggy, they got inundated. And that’s why there was additional flooding and damage along the coast. On the other end of the spectrum, dry areas stayed mostly dry. My home state of Oklahoma is in the western part of the worst-hit drought region, and it didn’t get any relief from Isaac. Nor did many of the communities stretching east and north from there. Most of the areas in deep drought remained at the same level they were at the beginning of summer. Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois all needed about a foot of rain to mitigate their drought. And even though Illinois got about that much–and much more than its neighbors—the timing wasn’t that good. According to Jim Angel, the Illinois state climatologist, the rain was too late in the season to reverse the damage that had already been done to the corn crops. The Central U.S. needed about a foot of rain to make up from the summer deficit and much of the Gulf Coast got just that from Isaac. Drought is all about when and where… And depending on your livelihood, the timing can be just as important as the amount of rainfall.

When you visit South Lafourche Parish and Grande Isle in Louisiana, you realize the ocean crosses dunes to work its way inland, for example, to reach New Orleans. The mayor of Grande Isle describes how his local dunes are the state’s first line of defense against surging storms from the Gulf. Transcript Tim Osborn, NOAA Office of Coast Survey We’re here at the NOAA tide station in Grand Isle Louisiana, the state’s only inhabited barrier island. It’s really an important location because it’s actually reporting the highest sea level rise rate in the world. With the present trends that we are seeing coming from the Grand Isle tide station, the coastal landscape today across 12,000 square miles of Louisiana’s coastal zone will be inundated by the end of the century. David Camardelle, Grande Isle Mayor Tim, you’re looking at this levee system right here. You’re looking at 45 miles from New Orleans. This is the first line of defense to protect not only Grand Isle but all of New Orleans and the vicinity, the 6 parishes on the other side of this levee. It’s very important to have this levee system. Without this levee system as the first line of defense, no telling what could happen to New Orleans. Tim Osborn We have the breakwaters just offshore helping break down storm waves before they hit the beach. And then the dunes, or what they call the levees here, are built in waves—actually two separate dune features that help knock down the storm waves—help buffer the storm energy before it actually crests over the top of those dunes, those levees, and gets into the coastal community itself. David Camardelle I’ve seen the water come up to the top of the levee, and there was no other water on the other side. As you see, the vegetation is to make sure the sand doesn’t fly off the top of this levee. Tim Osborn Grand Isle is literally a living example of adapting its landscape, its population, to sea level rise and to subsidence. If it does, it continues to serve as the front line of defense to maintaining the shoreline of coastal Louisiana as it is today. Editor’s note: The Grand Isle tide station is recording a relative sea level rise (includes the rising of global water levels combined with ground settling and sinking, or subsidence) that is one of the highest in the world, and certainly the largest for a large land area. Some other small locations have rates as high, but groundwater extraction and other local effects are thought to be causing those locations large relative sea level rise rates. ___ Links Read the full-length feature story: Thriving on a Sinking Landscape Help us improve our content",

Transcript David Miller, Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development I’m David Miller and I was the project manager for the original LA-1 project that you see behind you here. When I was in high school, I could walk out there several hundred yards. Now you have to have a boat to get out there. And the sea level rise that’s occurring, that is something we had to take into account when we built this structure. The data we received and used from NOAA to make this thing last 75 years was critical. Through a cooperative effort with NOAA early on in the project, we were able to gather data and information through the GPS technology that told us what was happening. And we could then go back and verify what we were seeing. Frankly, what we found out was a little scary. We’re losing almost a half an inch a year because of sea level rise*. So we had to take that into account looking forward. I’m very confident the information that we gathered and that we used in the design and planning of this structure is going to give us a 75 year design life. That’s important because just down the road there is Port Fourchon that supplies a tremendous amount of the offshore oil industry, specifically the deep water. It was very important to have that information. It was very important to know that we would have confidence that it would work. *Editor’s note: This rate is for relative sea level rise, which includes both rising global ocean levels and the impact of subsidence, which is the settling and sinking of the ground over time. __ Links Read the full-length feature story: Thriving on a Sinking Landscape Help us improve our content",

And if we change by a few degrees, Just two or three or four degrees warmer, is enough to make Maine’s climate be more like Connecticut’s. And if it gets a little warmer than that, like even New Jersey’s climate. So that’s a way of having a gauge for the kinds of changes that are going on. If the sea level goes up two or three feet along the coast of Maine in this century, that’s a very significant change.

Transcript Josh Kent, Louisiana State University In the old days, in order to measure elevations, we had to rely on brass discs we called benchmarks, which we hammered deep into the ground. And these would tell us how things are and what the elevation of things would be. But what we found was that the sea level started to rise relative to these benchmarks. And as they were rising, we could measure them. But in South Louisiana, what we were finding, it wasn’t just sea level rise in action, it was also subsidence. The ground was sinking, taking the benchmark with it. So what we have to do is come up with a better way of making measurements of how sea level is rising and how the ground is subsiding.

Port Fourchon sits on the very edge of the country, all the better for vessels shuttling supplies to and from deepwater oil platforms across miles and miles of ocean. Keeping it open is a big deal because the port services 90 percent of all deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Port Director Chett Chiasson tours the harbor while discussing the importance of preparedness, adaptation, and resilience. Transcript Chett Chiasson, Executive Director of Port Fourchon We service 90% of all the deep water activity in the Gulf of Mexico. And that’s where our energy is. That’s where we’re moving forward into the future. There would be an $8 billion impact to the gross domestic product of this nation if Port Fourchon was inaccessible for a three-month period. Tim Osborn, NOAA Office of Coast Survey The experience we’ve seen is when Hurricane Katrina and Rita did major damage in the Gulf of Mexico and to this coast and to our refineries, we saw price spikes at the gas pump, and they were severe. The continuity of supply of energy that this country relies upon is so critical. I mean, we have no downtime. And one of the issues really comes down to is – do we have an operating roadway to a functional port, to a service base supporting the production that’s going on in the Gulf of Mexico today? Chett Chiasson That’s why we always bring back this key word all the time, which is resiliency. This country has finally seen that, especially in light of Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, and all the other storms that have come through. We understand that resiliency is key for us. We understand it here at the port. Our tenants here, servicing the oil and gas industry, understand it as well. You’ll see that, as far as construction goes. You’ll see buildings elevated. You’ll see hardening of structures because we know that as we go, so does our energy supply. ___ Links Read the full-length feature story: Thriving on a Sinking Landscape Help us improve our content",

Transcript Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory: There is real truth out there. You know, people can have different opinions about how we do things … what’s right, what’s wrong. But, in science we can make real progress because there is objective truth in terms of what’s present, and how does the real world operate—the physical world. We can really figure this out. And that’s an aspect of science that I love. Well, you know, I’m a government employee. I’m a public servant. We are supposed to help the public deal with, in this case, the greenhouse gas problem and climate change. Dr. Chris Landsea, NOAA National Hurricane Center: My salary is paid by the citizens so I think I have a special responsibility in that regard if anyone in the public asks — you know, what are you doing, what are you providing, what does your research say? — to answer them. But also as someone living in Miami [Florida], with a family in Miami, I want to find out what’s going on for my wife’s and for my kids’ sake. Dr. Marika Holland, NOAA National Climatic Data Center: It’s important to inform those issues of societal relevance, and communicate our science, not only to other scientists, which is critically important in moving the field forward, but also to the larger society because it does impact society. Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory: So there’s two different products here: one product is really for scientists — increasing knowledge — and the other [product] are assessments, to help the public and policy makers deal with the (climate change) issue. Dr. David Easterling, NOAA National Climatic Data Center: What we do is we look at the data and say, “This is what the data show.” I’m not trying to put any twist on it. If the data started suddenly showing the climate cooling we would say, “Alright the climate looks like it’s cooling.” Let the results speak for themselves. Dr. Jay Lawrimore, NOAA National Climatic Data Center: Having information is the key to being able to plan, to adapt, and to use the climate to your advantage — whatever that might be. We’re (climate scientists) in the spotlight and so what we have to do has to be based on sound science. ___ Video courtesy of Ceilings Unlimited©, adapted from the NOAA-sponsored production Proof or Propaganda (click to see more).

This is the first in a three-part video series Dr. Richard Feely, a senior scientist at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, discusses the origin and impacts of ocean acidification. You may view the rest of the series using the following links: Part 2: How Will Animals Be Affected by Ocean Acidification? Part 3: How Will Ocean Ecosystems Be Affected by Ocean Acidification? Transcript What is ocean acidification? Feely: The process of burning fossil fuels — coal and oil and natural gas — over the last two hundred years has released about 500 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere as carbon. You might think of it this way: We’re releasing right now about 70 million tons of CO2 every day into the atmosphere. And about a third of that, about 20 million tons of CO2, is being absorbed regularly by the oceans. And that ocean uptake then of 20 million tons of CO2 has caused, over the last 200 years or so, about a .1 pH change. pH is a logarithmic scale just like the Richter Scale. So a .1 pH change represents about a 30 percent increase in the overall acidity of the oceans. So the ocean has dropped its pH so far from about 8.2 to about 8.1. Using present day scenarios of CO2 emissions, we might expect to see a further pH drop of about .3 to .4 pH units, which would mean an increase in acidity of another 150 to 200 hundred percent. This is a dramatic change in the acidity of the oceans. And it has a serious impact on our ocean ecosystems; in particular, it has an impact on any species of calcifying organism that produces a calcium carbonate shell. ___ Links Read the full-length feature story: An Upwelling Crisis: Ocean Acidification.

This is the second in a three-part video series Dr. Richard Feely, a senior scientist at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, discusses the origin and impacts of ocean acidification. Transcript How will ocean animals be affected by ocean acidification? Feely: If you go to the beach, of course, what you’ll see are shells from clams and mollusks, and sometimes you’ll see a sand dollar. All these different species form calcium carbonate shells. And they form their shells in a high pH world. And the ability to form their shells, the rate at which they can produce their shells, or even if they can produce their shells, is directly dependent on the changing CO2 levels and the changing pH of seawater. And you can get to the point where they can no longer produce their shells. And we call that the saturation state of seawater. And, there’s been some experiments by scientists that have shown that if they place these organisms, some species of organisms, into this under-saturated water, this corrosive waters, the shells will dissolve, in some cases while the organism is still alive. That’s not true for all organisms. Some organisms have adapted to protect their shells with an organic coating. But as soon as that organisms dies, that organic coating will dissolve away and then the shells dissolve. And we see that in under-saturated waters. Throughout the water column, it’s a normal process in geochemistry. As we add more and more CO2 from the atmosphere to the oceans, this corrosive water is getting closer and closer to the surface, where it comes in contact with out ocean ecosystems. And so all those species that are dependent on the calcium carbonate are susceptible to this dissolution. The coral reefs can no longer produce their skeletons. The basic phytoplankton . . . some species of phytoplankton. . . produce a calcium carbonate shell. They are called a “coccolithophorid,” and they can no longer produce those shells. Zooplankton, next level up [in the marine food web], the very small animals which are a primary food source for fish: a large portion of zooplankton form these calcium carbonate shells. And as this water gets onto our Continental Shelf, then it affects our major fisheries. It affects all the bottom fisheries, such as clams and oysters and sea urchins and crabs. And it affects the water column, because of these ecosystem changes between the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, and the fish. ___ Links Read the full-length feature story: An Upwelling Crisis: Ocean Acidification.

This is the third in a three-part video series Dr. Richard Feely, a senior scientist at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, discusses the origin and impacts of ocean acidification. Transcript How will ocean ecosystems be affected by ocean acidification? Feely: If they [marine plants and animals] cannot adapt, where will they go? Will they go to waters that have a higher pH and are more supersaturated? If so, what happens to the ecosystem that’s left behind? What happens to the fish that are dependent on these organisms for their food? This is a very serious question. And for coral reef systems in particular, for example, the skeleton of the coral reef system is the major home for 25 percent of all our fisheries that live in coral reef systems during some portion of their livelihoods. So it’s a critical component of the ocean ecosystem. On a global basis, about twenty percent of our food resources, in terms of protein, comes directly from fishery sources. So, any changes to the ecosystem will have a direct impact on our food resources from the sea. From the pre-industrial to the present, we know that the surface water pH has changed by .1 units; a thirty percent increase in acidity. Over the last thirty years or so, we have been able to specifically measure the changes in pH and the change in CO2 of our surface waters. We do this at the Hawaiian Ocean Time Series off of Hawaii, which is commensurate with the Mauna Loa record in the atmosphere, which is also off the Big Island. We do this off of Bermuda. We do this in a number of locations throughout the world oceans. So our ability to monitor these changes have taken place. You can go back further in the geological record and look at ice core records to see what the impacts of CO2 have been and the changes in CO2 levels in the atmosphere. And what we find is that the atmospheric concentrations, over the last 800,000 years or so, have changed between about a 180 parts per million [of seawater] and 280 parts per million. But we are now as high as 385 parts per million at present. And by the end of this century we could be as high as 800 parts per million. And we can see from the sedimentary record and the ice core records that these changes that are taking place throughout this century, out to the end of the century and into the next century, far exceed anything we have seen over the last twenty million years or so. Clearly in the very far distant geological past, 35 to 50 million years ago, we’ve had CO2 levels that were much higher than they are at present. The difference is that the rate of change of CO2 is so dramatic now that it far exceeds any changes that have taken place in the past. We are changing the ecosystem so fast, we’re changing the ocean system so fast, that many of the organisms don’t have the ability to adapt to these changes that are taking place. ___ Links Read the full-length feature story: An Upwelling Crisis: Ocean Acidification.

Editor’s Note: Through its Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, NOAA works with America’s coastal and Great Lakes states to plan for climate change. We asked several managers of state Coastal Zone Management and National Estuarine Research Reserves to comment on their states’ plans for adaptation in their coastal areas in the face of climate change. Their responses appear below… Transcript John Watkins, Chief, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management: There’s a lot of uncertainty on the Great Lakes about what climate change will do, as to what will happen to our water resources. We also have uncertainty as to what will occur with our ecosystems as climate change occurs. Part of what we’re trying to do collectively with Sea Grant and other regional organizations within the Great Lakes is to look at how we can assess the potential effects of climate change, when we don’t know what they’re going to be, capture that info, make predictions and help our local communities come up with plans to adapt to those issues that will come about. Rebecca Ellin, Manager, The North Carolina Reserve: I do think in the next 20 years, North Carolina is going to have to work hard to come up with some strategies to combat sea level rise. One of the many projections that has been put out for North Carolina is that the Outer Banks barrier islands system will largely disappear, and with the disappearance of that , it’s really going to dramatically change the traditional picture of what the North Carolina coastline looks like. I think there are a variety of things we can do to combat sea level rise. And certainly the National Estuarine Research Reserve System and the Reserve in North Carolina can play a big part in that, because one of the great things is that we own land, and reserve sites can actually serve as sentinel sites to look at how the impacts from sea level rise and climate change are impacting our coastal habitats. Ted Diers, New Hampshire Coastal Program Manager: We have a big beach area. 78 percent of our coastal shoreline, the shoreline that’s directly on the Gulf of Maine is in public ownership. That’s a phenomenal thing. We have these great public beaches that go all up and down. You can essentially walk the entire New Hampshire shoreline without having to be on private property. However, as sea level rises, what’s going to happen to that asset? Deerin Babb Brott, Asst. Secretary, Ocean and Coastal Zone Management, Massachusestts: I think that the biggest challenges Massachusetts faces currently in coastal zone management revolve around climate change and how we’re responding to that. Paul Dest, Manager, Wells Reserve, Maine: And I’m thinking in the areas of resilient communities, and coastal hazards, if you will… climate change, sea level rise … we have to plan for that. Gary Lytton, Manager, Rookery Bay Reserve, Florida: There’s no doubt in my mind that one of our biggest challenges in the future is climate change. We’re already seeing effects of climate change within the boundaries of the Reserve. A specific example is landward migration of marine wetlands, like mangroves, within the 10,000 miles which is part of the area we manage. One of my biggest concerns in southwest Florida is that we are at high risk for impacts associated with sea level rise. We’re a very low lying area of the country. And let’s face it, the science is very strong that sea level rise is happening, it’s been happening, and it will continue to accelerate. When we talk again about the impacts of climate change that we know are coming, my biggest hope would be that in the next 20 years, we have an actively engaged coastal community in southwest Florida that is ready to step up and make some sacrifices, if you will, to prepare for what we know is coming. ___ Links Read the full length article Planning for Climate Change Adaptation.

    "content": "Running time 6:12 The International Research Institute for Climate and Society and Google are offering a guided tour of Africa to teach you about the relationship between climate and deadly meningitis outbreaks there. No need to pack your bags, though. It’s a virtual tour that you can take via your computer, narrated by IRI scientist Judy Omumbo. Transcript Judy Omumbo, Scientist, International Research Institute: It has been called the most neglected among neglected diseases, but not for its lack of impact. Meningitis, an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and the spinal cord, infects quickly and can kill up to half of its victims if left untreated. Survivors rarely emerge unscathed, often suffering permanent brain damage or deafness. While individual cases of meningitis are found worldwide, the most devastating epidemics occur in the notorious Meningitis Belt of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Here, the disease has affected close to a million people in 25 countries in the past two decades. Much about how and why these epidemics occur is unknown, but we do know that climate plays a key role. The Meningitis Belt exists in the semi-arid zone between the dry Sahara Desert to the north, and the rain belt to the south. Having a better understanding of what drives the onset and spread of meningitis can mean the difference between life and death. While meningitis can be prevented through vaccination, there aren’t enough doses or enough workers to immunize everyone, so researchers are trying to predict when and where outbreaks will occur. Dr. Eric Bertherat, Medical Epidemiologist, World Health Organization: Regarding the strategy, what we would like to do is to improve our decision system, to try to make a kind of preemptive vaccination, to start the vaccination just before the outbreak occurs. And for that, we need to better understand what are the risk factors for having these outbreaks in each district. Omumbo: Not surprisingly, the burden of meningitis is heaviest on the poor. Dr. Forgor Abudulai Adams, Research Fellow, Navrongo Health Research Center, in Ghana: In time of epidemics or outbreaks the health system is disorganized. The community is disorganized, because people have to be burying their loved ones. People become scared, panic, they don’t know what is happening, whether they will be next. And generally the burden on the family is very huge — lives are lost, resources have been spent impromptu, funds have been looked for to cover bills and take care of whatever expenses they might have incurred. Omumbo: Outbreaks in the Meningitis Belt have long been associated with the dusty seasonal winds that blow off the Sahara. Starting in November, winds – depicted here by arrows showing their direction and strength — blow from the Sahara, bringing dry, dusty conditions to the Belt. During this time, the number of meningitis cases begins to rise. By April, more humid air is brought by winds blowing in from the Atlantic. This marks the start of the rainy season, and the number of meningitis cases again declines. In recent decades, the extent of the Belt seems to be changing — meningitis is occurring in more areas of Ethiopia, for example, and researchers are trying to understand why. Dr. Yonas Asfaw, Officer of Disease Prevention and Control, Ethiopian Ministry of Health, in Ethiopia: Meningitis used to occur mostly in the western and the northwestern part of the country. As you know, the meningitis belt involves most of the western part of Ethiopia, and the pattern of occurrence in the previous years was 8-10 years on a cyclical mode. But as of the past 10 years, meningitis is a yearly phenomenon involving a smaller place and a much milder form than the previous years. So meningitis is moving now from the west to the southern part and it has become a yearly phenomenon. Omumbo: Experts are working to develop better forecasting systems to predict areas where epidemics will most likely occur. The National Meteorological Agency has formed partnerships with research centers like the International Research Institute for Climate and Society and European meteorological agencies to expand access to up-to-date weather forecasts and satellite data. But in order to fully understand the disease dynamics of meningitis, more data are needed. Diriba Korecha Dadi, National Meteorological Agency, in Ethiopia: Our meteorological stations mainly situated following the main roads and also in the small towns or cities, so we don’t have such a significant number of meteorological stations particularly over these remote areas where we used to get these meningitis cases. We try to identify the potential climate parameters that might cause the spreading or emerging of meningitis, particularly temperature and the onset of the rainy season over this western part of the country where the meningitis belt extends.

We know this through climate monitoring, which entails measuring temperature on land and across the ocean. Transcript Deke Arndt, Climate Monitoring Branch Chief, National Climatic Data Center On any given day or any given month, somebody somewhere– maybe even where you live– experiences colder-than-average temperature, even though the globe as a whole is warmer than average. Pockets of cold on a warming planet. How can both be true? It has been true for hundreds of months. These patterns are complex, but they’re not random. Tracking global temperature starts with measurements in specific places. Long-term temperature records at stations like this establish what is “normal.” It’s the average temperature. Subtracting this average temperature from the observed temperature leaves a “temperature anomaly.” The data from stations across large areas allow us to map these temperature anomalies around the globe. The red areas on this map were warmer than average during winter– December, January, and February. Blue areas were colder than the long-term averages. Last winter, the western United States was colder than average, but the East was warmer. Intense cold blanketed northeastern Asia while it was warmer than average just to the west. Even though there are a many pockets of cold, the overall global temperature was above average. The area with above-average temperature outweighed the area with below-average temperature. Another interesting pattern is clear in this dataset. Notice that the temperature anomalies over the ocean are much more muted than over land. This is because the ocean warms, and cools, more slowly than land. Notice how much of the ocean is above average, though. Moving into Spring, this March was below the 20th century average in the United States, but the overall global temperature remained above the long-term average. In studying regional climate patterns, climatologists are learning about the planet as a whole. Understanding why one region differs from another takes an understanding about interactions among the atmosphere, the ocean, and even human decisions. Sometimes, being climate-smart can be as complex as the climate system itself. From Asheville, North Carolina, I’m Deke Arndt ___ Links March",

    "content": "Running time 3:41 The big story for the upcoming spring is the likelihood that drought will continue across large parts of the south-central and southwestern United States, and even expand into California and eastern Texas. Some of these areas have been experiencing drought for more than a year, and the latest 3-month outlook from the Climate Prediction Center offers little hope for relief. Transcript Ned Gardiner, Climate Visualization Manager, contractor to NOAA NOAA’s National Weather Service released its Spring Outlook on March 21st. The Outlook encompasses temperature, precipitation, drought, and flooding expectations for the coming three months. Mike Halpert, Acting Director of the Climate Prediction Center, discusses the outlook and its implications. Mike Halpert, Acting Director, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center The big story for the upcoming spring appears to be the expectations that drought will continue across large parts of the south-central and southwestern United States, even expanding into California and eastern Texas. Some of these areas, in particular in the central part of that region, have experienced drought now for over a year, and at this time we just don’t see relief coming during the next three months. The temperature outlook for the months of April-May-June favors above-average temperatures across a large part of the United States, extending from the eastern seaboard, across the Midwest and the Southeast, into the central and southern Plains, and finally into the southwestern U.S. Above-average temperatures are also favored up in the northern parts of Alaska. The only areas anticipated to see below-average temperatures are in a region from the Pacific Northwest extending along the U.S.-Canadian border through Montana and North Dakota. The region most likely to experience above-average temperatures this spring is in the south-sentral United States, a region centered on Texas. This is an area that has had extensive drought for the better part of the last year, and often-times during spring and summer, regions that are drier-than-average do experience above-average temperatures. The outlook favors below-average precipitation in a region extending from much of the western part of the U.S. through the Southwest across Texas, the Gulf Coast, and much of Florida. Large parts of the U.S. (for precipitation) have an equal chance forecast, meaning that there is no tilt in the odds towards either above-, near-average, or below-average precipitation. The outlook favors above-average precipitation in the upper Midwest and regions centered on Northern Indiana. There’s a tilt in the odds towards above-average precipitation in parts of the Midwest. The outlook for Hawaii favors below-average precipitation and temperature. With regards to drought, parts of Hawaii as well as large sections of the central and western United States are also experiencing varying levels of drought. Looking ahead three months, drought is expected to improve in parts of the Southeast, the western Great Lakes, and the northern Great Plains. However, unfortunately drought looks to be a continuing story in the Southwest and south-central U.S., with drought even developing in parts of California, eastern Texas, and the Florida peninsula. The Flood Outlook shows the region most under the gun for river flooding this spring is in the north-central Great Plains, particularly along the Red River of the North. Ned Gardiner NOAA produces the outlook to help communities and businesses prepare for the challenges spring is likely to present. From the Climate Prediction Center, I’m Ned Gardiner.

Editor's Notes About FEMA flood plain maps The flood maps provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency reflect the flood potential of U.S. neighborhood and coastal areas based on what has flooded in the past. The maps only \"account for sea level rise\" to the extent that the severity of past flooding has been influenced by sea level rise that has already occurred. FEMA floodplain maps do not take into consideration any future amount of sea level rise due to global warming. About \"Superstorm\" Sandy \"Superstorm\" is not an official meteorological term. It sprang up in the heat of the moment as people struggled to find a word that adequately described the tremendous destruction of a storm that was transitioning from a hurricane to an extratropical cyclone near the time of its landfall. Sandy had lost its hurricane-like \"warm core,\" but it retained hurricane-force winds. At the same time, the wind field stretched over a much larger area than is typical for hurricanes—more akin to mid-latitude winter storms like Nor'easters. More details about Sandy's lifecycle are available in a NOAA technical report (pdf).

[transcript] This is a year that is likely to become an El Niño year, and many people associate El Niño years with bad years--years of disasters, years of drought. The truth is that during El Niño years you have winners and losers. I am especially interested in the agricultural sector and food security issues--for example, in an El Niño year you have an increased chance of having drought or dry conditions in Australia. This affects, for example, the amount of wheat that is going to be in international markets. It affects the prices of wheat. [El Niño] also gives an increased chance of dry conditions in Indonesia: problems with fires problems for small farmers in Indonesia. But at the same time, it means a high chance of good rainfall say for summer crops in southeast South America. So you have places like Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay where the summer crops are likely to be good. You have more-than-normal rainfall in those seasons. It's also complicated because, for example, let's take the case of Southeast South America, specifically Uruguay: for winter crops like wheat, if you get a very wet spring that means of course water will not be limiting the wheat fields, but it may increase disease problems, fungus problems. You have higher humidity, higher temperatures. So the key message is that El Niño year doesn't mean one thing, it means many different things. And it means for sure impacts on the international stocks of food. Now that doesn't mean there are only negative impacts in the international stocks. For example, an El Niño year may mean less Australian wheat in the market, but it may also mean more Argentinian wheat in the market. It may also mean for example social problems in northeast Brazil, where the likelihood of drought is increased in El Niño years, but it may mean great harvest of summer crops in Paraguay or Uruguay.

California, which saw extensive flooding in February, is susceptible to additional flooding from possible storms through the remainder of the wet season and later, from snowmelt. U.S. areas at risk for minor (light blue), moderate (medium blue), or major (dark blue) flooding this spring due to winter precipitation and temperature patterns.  map, based on data from the National Weather Sevice. “If you’re in northern North Dakota, or in the Snake River basin in Idaho, prepare for moderate to major flooding this spring,” said Tom Graziano, Ph.D., director of NOAA’s Office of Water Prediction. “Snowpack is heavy in the West and northern plains, and if our long term warm-up coincides with spring rains, already saturated soils will not be able to absorb the increased water, which would lead to increased runoff and potential flooding.” But while the extreme north could see flooding, the rest of the country could be warmer than average, forecasters said. “Above average temperatures are favored for much of the U.S. this spring with the south-central Plains and eastern U.S. having the highest chance for warmer than average conditions,” said Jon Gottschalck, chief, Operational Prediction Branch, NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. There was a remarkable turnaround in California’s five-year drought over the winter. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, issued today, the geographic extent of drought in the state dropped from 73 percent three months ago to eight percent this week, due to near-record precipitation from a series of powerful winter storms. Also, in February, only three percent of the contiguous U.S. saw severe to exceptional drought, the lowest level in seven years. A wet winter in California finally made a significant dent in the state's multi-year drought conditions. As of March 7, only a small part of the state was experiencing abnormal dryness (yellow) or Moderate drought (orange).  map, based on data form the U.S. Drought Monitor project.

Driving the forecast for major flooding in northern North Dakota is an extensive snowpack, containing up to four inches of liquid water that could increase with additional storms through April. When this snowpack melts, the already saturated and frozen soil won’t be able to absorb it, creating runoff and potential flooding. The location of greatest concern is Devils Lake, where forecasters are projecting a near record runoff that could cause the lake to rise three to four feet, possibly exceeding its record high flood level set in June",

The pressure gradient reflects the strength of the atmospheric circulation across the tropical Pacific. Positive values are a sign of La Niña. Negative values are a sign of El Niño.  image, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or \"ENSO\" for short, is a powerful natural climate pattern that operates in the tropical Pacific Ocean. ENSO involves coordinated, season-long changes to ocean surface temperature and atmospheric circulation. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) tracks the atmospheric part of the pattern. (The Oceanic Niño Index tracks the ocean part.) The SOI compares the difference from average air pressure in the western Pacific, measured in Darwin, Australia, to the difference from average pressure in the central Pacific, measured at Tahiti. Difference from average sea level pressure during winters when the Southern Oscillation Index is strongly positive (top) or negative (bottom). During La Niña (positive SOI), the pressure is higher than average (red) over the central Pacific near Tahiti, and lower than average (gray) over Australia. During El Niño, the SOI is negative, and the anomalies are reversed.  image, based on data from the NOAA Physical Science Lab. These pressure anomalies indicate whether the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere over the tropical Pacific, known as the Walker Circulation, is stronger or weaker than normal. The Walker Circulation is giant loop in which air blows westward at the surface, climbs high into the atmosphere over the Western Pacific, flows eastward at high altitudes, and sinks back to the surface over the central-east Pacific. Averaged over the span of a month or season, the rising branch of the loop creates persistent low surface pressure in the western Pacific. The sinking branch of the loop creates persistent high pressure in the central-eastern Pacific. The main features of the Walker Circulation in the tropical Pacific during ENSO-neutral conditions. On average, persistent convection and low surface pressure associated with rising branches of the Walker Circulation are found over the Maritime continent, northern South America, and eastern Africa. Subsidence (sinking air) and high pressure are found over the central tropical Pacific and to a lesser extent over the Middle East and Southwest Asia.  drawing by Fiona Martin. During La Niña events, the Walker Circulation intensifies, with even more rising air and rainfall over the Western Pacific and more sinking, dry air in the central Pacific. The already-low surface pressure over northern Australia and the Maritime Continent drops even lower. During El Niño, the circulation weakens, or sometimes even reverses. There's more convection, rainfall, and lower-than-average surface pressure in the central Pacific, and less convection, clearer skies, and higher-than-average surface pressure in the western Pacific. These pressure patterns have been observed at weather stations in Darwin, Australia, and Tahiti going back many decades. As our ability to observe larger and more remote areas has increased, climate experts developed an index called the Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index, which compares pressure anomalies across wider areas of the western and eastern Pacific. The Equatorial Southern Oscillation Index compares pressure anomalies across a broad region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5 degrees North and South latitude, 80–130 degrees West longitude) to pressure anomalies on the other side of the basin (5 degrees North and South latitude, 90–140 degrees East longitude).  image by Fiona Martin. For NOAA to declare El Niño or La Niña underway, both the ocean and the atmosphere have to be in sync, or as experts say, \"coupled.\" When they're coupled, they reinforce each other, causing the El Niño or La Niña event to intensify and persist for a season or more.

    "content": "For years, people have been pointing to El Niño as the culprit behind floods, droughts, famines, economic failures, and record-breaking global heat. Copyright by Harvey Schwadron; licensed through cartoonstock.com. For years, people have been pointing to El Niño as the culprit behind floods, droughts, famines, economic failures, and record-breaking global heat. Can a single climate phenomenon really cause all these events? Is the world just a step away from disaster when El Niño conditions develop? El Niño refers to conditions when the sea's surface in an area along the equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean gets warmer than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically just 1-3°C (about 2-5°F) warmer than normal, but it has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and beyond. La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño-a yin to its yang, so to speak. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific are cooler than normal. The lower surface temperatures suppress transfer of heat and moisture to the atmosphere, again affecting air pressure and precipitation patterns across a large region. These global maps centered on the Pacific Ocean show patterns of sea surface temperature during El Niño and La Niña episodes. The colors along the equator show areas that are warmer or cooler than the long-term average. El Niño and La Niña episodes tend to recur every three to seven years, with each set of conditions settling in for about a year. The \"seesaw\" of high pressure in the western Pacific associated with El Niño shifting to high pressure in the eastern Pacific associated with La Niña is known as the Southern Oscillation. The oft-used term El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, describes the alternating states of the linked ocean-atmosphere system as well as the normal state that occurs between them. El-Niño-related drought can reduce food availability in regions where agriculture is dependent on rain. Outside of normal seasonal variation, ENSO is one of the main sources of year-to-year variability in Earth's weather and climate, with significant socioeconomic implications for many regions around the world. In normal years, trade winds push warm water and its associated heavy rainfall westward from the central Pacific toward Indonesia. During an El Niño, the winds die down and can even reverse direction, pushing the rains toward South America instead. This is why people in Indonesia and Australia typically associate El Niño with drought, while people in Peru connect El Niño with floods. These changing climate conditions, combined with other factors, can have serious impacts on society: impacts include reduced crop harvests, wildfires, or loss of life and property in floods. Public health records also offer evidence that El Niño conditions increase the risk of certain vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, in places where they don't occur every year. Since its discovery, people have been trying to understand and explain ENSO by generalizing its effects or connecting it to all extreme weather events. As a result, people may hold some ideas about El Niño that aren't necessarily true. The following brief discussions can clear up some common misconceptions about El Niño. Fires in southeast Asia, droughts in eastern Australia, and flooding in Peru often accompany El Niño events. Much of the media coverage on El Niño has focused on the more extreme and negative consequences typically associated with the phenomenon. To be sure, the impacts can wreak havoc in developing and developed countries alike, but El Niño events are also associated with reduced frequency of Atlantic hurricanes, warmer winter temperatures (and reduced heating costs) across the northern United States, and plentiful spring/summer rainfall in southeastern Brazil, central Argentina and Uruguay, which leads to above-average yields from summer crops. On a worldwide basis, this isn't necessarily the case. In some regions, we've seen that El Niño exerts fairly consistent influences on climate. For example, El Niño conditions typically cause more rain to fall in Peru, and less rain to fall in Indonesia and Southern Africa. Combined with socioeconomic factors, these conditions can make a country or region more vulnerable to adverse impacts. However, compared with normal conditions, characteristic El Niño patterns enable climate scientists to produce more accurate seasonal forecasts and better predictions of extreme drought or rainfall for several regions around the globe. In turn, this improved predictability can help societies be better prepared to avoid or reduce potentially negative impacts. Ultimately, with better predictions, fewer areas with increased vulnerability may develop as disasters. Actually, El Niño and La Niña significantly affect only about 25% of the world's land surface during any particular season, and less than 50% of land during the entire time that ENSO conditions persist. Most regions experience impacts only during one specific season, and this can be months after the ENSO conditions first develop. For example, the recently developed",

The effects of our planet's slowly-but-surely increasing sea level are hard to imagine, and even harder to plan for. But for Steinhoff, the call to be aware of the threats is obvious and immediate. \"While most city planning efforts focus on the next 10 to 25 years, we're seeing the need to think further ahead, say 50 to 75 years out,\" she says.

As an environmental scientist with NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration in Seattle, Steinhoff is accustomed to taking that longer look at things. The \"ah-ha\" moment that increased the length of her view into the future came while she was enjoying the view of Puget Sound from the deck of a beachfront home. \"Even though I was trying to relax, I kept having this mental image of the same deck, 100 years into the future, totally swamped by sea water,\" she said. As she thought further, she recognized that losing the deck would be a small issue compared to the environmental damage that could result from flooding of contaminated sites and industrial storage locations around the Sound. For the past year, Steinhoff has engaged in work that could help people identify and avoid some of the damage that could accompany sea level rise in the Pacific Northwest. She has devoted her energies to developing the Climate Assessment and Proactive Response Initiative, also known as CAPRI. The arm of the Pacific Ocean that extends into the state of Washington, known as Puget Sound, is the largest and perhaps the most biologically productive estuary on the West Coast.

These shifts in air pressure signal that the atmosphere is shifting its weight (technically, its mass) from place to place. There’s a pattern to the shifting that is sort of like water sloshing back and forth in a bowl. The atmosphere sloshes northward; air pressure strengthens over the Arctic and weakens over the mid-latitudes (either the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, or both). Then the atmosphere sloshes southward; air pressure strengthens over the mid-latitudes and weakens over the Arctic. This periodic sloshing is called the Arctic Oscillation.

    "content": "In late March, torrential rains pounded southern Thailand. In one week, some places on the Malay Peninsula received more than 4 feet of rain. The out-of-season rains caused deadly flash floods and landslides. Heavy rain isn't unusual in Thailand, but it is unusual for this time of year. Southeast Asia typically has very rainy summers and dry winters and springs. This pattern results from the interaction of two phenomena: the seasonal migration of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (see animation below) and the Asian monsoon. Monthly average global rain rates. The sequence begins in March, when summer is drawing to a close in the Southern Hemisphere. The highest rain rates on the map (blue) occur south of the equator, and places like Madagascar, northern Australia, and the southern Amazon Rainforest are near the end of their rainy seasons. By June, those places are dry, and Northern Hemisphere tropical locations, including India, Southeast Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara are receiving rain. The Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a band of daily showers and thunderstorms around the equator, where solar heating and evaporation are intense year round. Global observations of monthly average rainfall show how the ITCZ rains follow the Sun; they shift north of the equator during Northern Hemisphere summer, and south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere summer. Normally, the ITCZ arrives in Thailand in May. On average, March rainfall in Thailand is low. By April, southern towns such as Surat Thani, on the Malay Peninsula, are seeing more showers, but the rainy season doesn’t usually begin in earnest until May. (Maps by Ned Gardiner and Hunter Allen, based on NASA Global Precipitation Climatology Project data provided by the NOAA/ESRL Climate Attribution Team.) The northward migration of the tropical rain belt into Thailand coincides with the beginning of the southwest phase of the Asian monsoon. (A monsoon is a climate pattern in which prevailing winds reverse directions on a seasonal basis.) During the summer, the Asian continent heats up more than the Indian Ocean to the south. Hot air over land rises, and moist air from the Indian Ocean flows in to replace it. This steady, onshore flow brings additional rainfall to Southeast Asia, including Thailand. (In the winter, the winds reverse, blowing offshore.) With both the arrival of the ITCZ and the onset of the monsoon usually not occurring until May, the average March rainfall at Surat Thani, on the Malay Peninsula in southern Thailand, is less than 2 inches.

At right, you'll find links to a series of posts-photos, data maps, and animations-that reveal how rapid warming is changing the Arctic landscape. Over the past year, scientists from around the world have continued to collect evidence of extreme melting on the surface of the Greenland ice sheet, declining summer sea ice cover, rapidly receding glaciers, and changing ocean pH-all of which have wide-ranging consequences for people, plants, and animals in the Arctic and beyond. At the root of these transformations is the continued widespread warming of surface air temperatures in the Arctic region. This above-average warmth continues a decade-long phenomenon that scientists describe as \"Arctic amplification,\" in which Arctic temperature anomalies are two or more times greater than those observed at lower latitudes. The amplification of warming in the Arctic reflects a powerful feedback between the region's ice covers and air temperature. As air temperature increases, ice melts; as the bright, reflective ice melts, it reveals darker ocean and land surfaces. These dark surfaces absorb more solar energy during the Arctic's summer season, when the Sun never sets. This causes more heating, which causes more melting...and so on. Record-setting changes are occurring throughout the Arctic environmental system. Given the projections of continued warming due to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, it is very likely that these changes will continue in years to come, with increasing climatic, physical, biological, and socioeconomic impacts.

Part one discussed observed and expected changes in water supply and how regional water managers are responding. By the end of September, nearly all the surface water in the Lower Rio Grande (map) had been drained. Below New Mexico’s Elephant Butte Reservoir, the river was flowing at a trickle, and sandy bars were exposed where the chocolate-colored river had been flowing as recently as mid-September. At Greg Daviet's pecan farm in the Mesilla Valley outside Las Cruces, the drone of groundwater pumps filled the air, and wells spit crystalline water onto thirsty orchards. Despite another dry year—the ninth time in the last decade that farmers received a fraction of the surface water they need to sustain their crops—the pecan trees are healthy thanks to bountiful groundwater that is pumped up from wells to nourish the crop. Pecan trees near Hatch, New Mexico, bathed in irrigation water from wells. The extra pumping during the dry times, however, comes at a price. Groundwater costs more per acre-foot than surface water and is more harmful to crops in the long run, because the water is saltier. For Daviet and some other farmers in the region, the drought’s toll is burdensome—but not bankrupting—and may force some creative measures to lessen the financial strain. “The water is still sufficient in a drought, but how we [manage] it needs to change,” Daviet said. “Drought will never be as profitable as wet times.” For other farms, however, the added expenses from continued dry conditions may push the owners to the brink.

This daily cycle of heating, evaporation, and convection creates a persistent band of showers and storms around Earth’s middle. The rising air near the equator is replaced by air from north and south of the equator. The Earth rotates beneath this moving air, causing it to turn to the west and creating the easterly trade winds. Because these trade winds converge near the equator, the tropical rain belt is known to meteorologists as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone. Monthly average global rain rates. The sequence begins in March, when summer is drawing to a close in the Southern Hemisphere. The highest rain rates on the map (blue) occur south of the equator, and places like Madagascar, northern Australia, and the southern Amazon Rainforest are near the end of their rainy seasons. By June, those places are dry, and Northern Hemisphere tropical locations, including India, Southeast Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara are receiving rain. Centered on the Pacific Ocean, this animation of monthly average rain rates shows how the tropical rain belt follows the Sun. The sequence begins in March, when summer is drawing to a close in the Southern Hemisphere. The highest rain rates on the map (blue) occur south of the equator, and places like Madagascar, northern Australia, and the southern Amazon Rainforest are near the end of their rainy seasons. By June, those places are dry, and Northern Hemisphere tropical locations, including India, Southeast Asia, and Africa south of the Sahara are receiving rain. The tropical rain belt stretches out in a virtually unbroken line across the open ocean. Over land, the line is distorted because of the interaction between the tropical rain belt and monsoons. In places with a monsoon climate, the prevailing winds over land and adjacent ocean areas reverse directions on a seasonal basis. The winds reverse because the land changes temperature more dramatically from season to season than water; the differences in heating alter the patterns of rising and sinking air. Winds usually blow offshore in winter and onshore in summer—like a daily coastal sea breeze, but on a much larger scale. For instance, the shifting of the tropical rain belt into the Northern Hemisphere in May and June coincides with the onset of the summer monsoon in Southeast Asia. As summer days lengthen and heating increases, land surfaces on the continent of Asia get hotter than surrounding oceans. The land heats the air, and the air rises. Warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean flows onshore, bringing rain. The interaction between the monsoon and the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone produces heavy rain over India, Southeast Asia, and southeastern China throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere summer. Similar interactions between monsoons and the north-south migration of tropical rains occurs in Australia, in the Amazon basin of northern South America, West Africa, and in Mexico and the U.S. Southwest.

As many a weather forecaster has explained, high pressure generally leads to calm winds and sunny skies, both of which boost temperatures during the all-day sunshine of mid-summer at high latitudes. Geopotential height is like a topographic map of the atmosphere. Imagine climbing a mountain. As you climb, the air gets thinner; the pressure drops. The geopotential height describes how high you have to climb before the pressure drops to a given value. A 700-millibar anomaly of 65 meters means that there is so much extra air over that spot on Earth that you’d have to climb 65 meters higher up the mountain than average before you reached the altitude where the air pressure dropped to 700 millibars.

Climate.gov’s Brian Kahn interviews Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate impacts expert at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, co-chair of the New York City Panel on Climate Change, and director of the NOAA-sponsored Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast. Cynthia Rosenzweig, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Why should New Yorkers care about sea level rise? First of all, sea level rise is a big issue for millions of people in the U.S., not just New Yorkers. Twenty-three of the 25 most densely populated U.S. counties are on the coast. In New York, the full brunt of Hurricane Sandy has shown how powerful and damaging the effects of coastal flooding can be for infrastructure and communities. The storm itself we can’t immediately link to climate change, but the flooding damage we can. As sea levels continue to rise, a storm of the same magnitude will cause even greater damages due to storm surges coming in on top of a higher “baseline” water level. What kind of sea level rise has New York Harbor seen over the past century? We’ve had roughly a foot of sea level rise in the New York City area in the past century. That’s measured at a tidal gauge near Battery Park just off the southern tip of Manhattan. The majority of the sea level rise in the New York City region is due to global warming: primarily, because of thermal expansion of ocean water as it warms and secondly, melting of land-based ice sheets. Land subsidence [sinking] in the New York City area has been roughly 3-4 inches per century, which is primarily due to the Earth’s crust rebounding* from being compressed by massive ice sheets that covered Canada and the northern U.S. about 20,000 years ago near the end of the last Ice Age. Local variations in ocean surface elevation associated with the strength of the Gulf Stream has played a small role as well. How do sea level rise and storm surge interact? Sea level rise is like a set of stairs. The 12-inch increase in New York Harbor over the last century means we’ve already gone up one step. When a coastal storm occurs, the surge caused by the storm’s winds already has a step up, literally. For Sandy, that meant greater coastal flooding in New York and the surrounding region than we would have experienced a century ago. Continuing to climb the staircase of sea level rise means we’ll see greater extent and greater frequency of coastal flooding from storms, even if storms don’t get any stronger. How does sea level rise in New York Harbor compare to other parts of the U.S.? What about the global average? Sea level isn’t rising evenly throughout the world. On average, global sea level has risen about eight inches since",

Part 2 is about the costs of drought for farmers in the region. On a mid-July afternoon, ditch riders—men patrolling irrigation channels—twisted open steel gates cut into concrete waterways in New Mexico’s Lower Rio Grande River Valley, bathing pecan orchards in water and nurturing vibrant chile plants. At first sight, all seemed a healthy, hydrated green. Hours later, however, I stood on a bluff overlooking Elephant Butte Reservoir, my eyes tracing the bleached rocks that once marked the high water. “It’s been a long time since water spilled over the dam,” said James Powell, Operations Manager for Elephant Butte Reservoir—water that irrigates about 90,000 acres of farmland in New Mexico and provides half the water supply of El Paso, Texas. “The reservoir is dropping about 2.5 feet per day,” he continued. “It will probably fall another 20 feet before we stop releasing water in late August of early September.” Amid a decade-long drought, water storage on the Rio Grande in New Mexico has plummeted. In coming weeks, Elephant Butte is expected to dip to five percent of capacity; all stored water designated for farming and urban needs will be completely exhausted, according to the Bureau of Reclamation. Until a string of wet years restocks the reservoirs, agricultural producers and urban residents will have to make do with whatever flows through the rivers and make up shortfalls with groundwater, an expensive and potentially unsustainable practice that is spurring novel efforts to corral monsoon rains in order to boost supplies. Water stored in Elephant Butte Reservoir (as a percent of its full capacity of 2.195 million acre-feet) at the beginning of the water year on October 1. Graph by Climate.Gov team, data courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. On the Rio Grande—historically the wellspring for more than five million people in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico—coping with scarcity has become a reality, and water management and use in the region may be a leading example of how to adapt to drier times. The Rio Grande flows about 1,800 miles from the peaks of southern Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico, forming a long stretch of the international border between the United States and Mexico. People use the water for different things along different stretches of the river. In northern New Mexico, Rio Grande water supplies a substantial portion of urban water needs for Albuquerque, while irrigation draws the most water in the middle and southern parts of the watershed in the state. The Rio Grande provides water for more than five million people in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. In New Mexico, it supplies a substantial portion of water for urban needs and irrigation, among other uses. Managed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Elephant Butte is New Mexico’s largest reservoir on the Rio Grande, with a capacity of about 2 million acre-feet of water. (An acre-foot covers one acre of land in one foot of water and satisfies, on average, the annual water needs of about eight Albuquerque residents.) About 25 miles down river, Caballo Reservoir can impound an additional 350,000 acre-feet. In a good year, these reservoirs together release about 790,000 acre-feet; 416,000 is allocated to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District in southern New Mexico, and 314,000 and 60,000 acre-feet are passed to Texas and Mexico, respectively. When flows in the river and storage in Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs are sufficient, the district doles out a full irrigation allotment of 3 feet of water per acre of land. In some years, they’ve allocated more; recently, allocation has been a lot less. “In about",

When the central tropical Pacific Ocean is warmer than average (El Niño) or colder than average (La Niña), a cascade of atmospheric changes ensures that many parts of the globe feel the effects. But here’s a problem to consider: if the ocean today is warmer than the long-term average, won’t it look like the tropical Pacific is in a permanent El Niño? Won’t La Niña—the cool phase—just disappear? Will we have to redefine the nature of these influential climate events? It’s a problem that scientists at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, the branch of the agency responsible for monitoring and forecasting ENSO events, have been considering for many years. The solution they came up with doesn’t change the definition of El Niño and La Niña episodes, but they were forced to reconsider what counts as “average” temperature in the tropical Pacific. The ENSO-related temperature fluctuations in the tropical Pacific that have such far-reaching impacts on seasonal climates downstream aren’t about a specific temperature. Instead, they are about relative temperatures, one region being hotter or colder than usual, and the climate chaos that ensues when things aren’t “normal.” NOAA’s operational definition of El Niño and La Niña conditions is pretty basic: seasonal temperatures of 0.5°C warmer (El Niño) or cooler (La Niña) than average in the central tropical Pacific.

Lake Sonoma, a reservoir in northern Sonoma County created by the construction of Warm Springs Dam. Credit: Water Environment Research Foundation. Wednesday is market day in the city of Santa Rosa, California. Jay Jasperse takes a walk through his local farmers market on a summer day and finds baskets and carts filled with juicy tomatoes, knobby roots, and sweet-smelling herbs. Signs propped up on the rows of booths advertise wine tastings. Just down the road, local giants like Kendall Jackson and E&J Gallo compete on an international scale. When Jasperse browses produce at the market, he sees beyond the spectrum of earthy colors and the familiar faces behind the counters. He sees the complicated workings behind many of the items on the shelves, such as a bottle of wine. He sees how the region’s climate—warm and dry in the summer, and cool and wet in the winter—makes winegrowing possible here. How a winegrower fastidiously watches over his vines until the hot summer sun has stressed the grapes to perfection. How one unexpected, deadly frost could compromise an entire year’s harvest. Farmers put fresh produce on display at one of region's local markets.  photo by Caitlyn Kennedy. The wine, the produce, and everything else at this farmers market depend upon the Russian River in some way. As Chief Engineer for the Sonoma County Water Agency, Jasperse always has one finger on the pulse of the river—a 110-mile long artery that winds through California’s Sonoma and Mendocino counties. It’s the water agency’s job to keep the region’s water system in balance so that everyone and everything gets its share, even when drought, floods, or frost strikes the region. Take this year, for instance. With less than half of its normal rainfall for this water year to date, Sonoma County is currently experiencing its driest period on record. Water levels in Lake Mendocino—the smaller and more vulnerable of the region’s two major reservoirs—have dropped to a near historic low storage level for this time of year. This reservoir provides water to several communities and farmers in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties. Water engineers Jay Jasperse (left) and Chris Delaney (right) discuss current water conditions at the Sonoma County Water Agency office in Santa Rosa, California.  photo by Caitlyn Kennedy. As familiar as water agency managers and engineers are with the river and its rhythms, they are less familiar with the invisible river in the sky that has a major impact on the region’s water supply. In mid-February, a large “atmospheric river” brought some much-needed rainfall to the region, although not enough to alleviate the current drought emergency. If relief does not come in the next few months, Californians will face significant cutbacks in water use to prevent the lake from going dry in the fall. Water shortages during dry years affect the interests of both winegrowers and conservationists in the region, and they leave water managers trying to strike a careful balance. Jasperse and his colleagues at the water agency are turning to science as a way to find compromise when water conflicts arise. It won’t be easy, though. While three protected species of fish may have a lawful claim to the Russian River, the winegrowers and their vines rule the land. California’s Russian River begins in Mendocino County and ends at the Pacific Ocean in Sonoma County. At many points along its winding curves, miles and miles of grape vines extend out from the riverbank and crawl across the rolling landscape. Heavy fog masks the green and tan hills in the distance. In Sonoma County, a complex interaction of geology, topography and maritime influences have created a patchwork of microclimates that yield diverse styles of wine.  photo by Caitlyn Kennedy. Jasperse drives past miles of vineyards every day on his scenic commute to the Sonoma County Water Agency office in Santa Rosa, California. He explains that the local climate is similar to that of Europe's Mediterranean region, which is famous for its winemaking. “We typically have warm, very dry summers and cool, wet winters. Most of our rainfall occurs from November through May, and it’s very unusual if we get any rainfall in other parts of the year. Because it’s all concentrated during the winter, it takes a lot of planning to make sure we have enough water in storage to last us through the year.” The Russian River drains a 1,485-square-mile watershed in Mendocino and Sonoma counties in California. There are two major dams in the watershed, creating Lake Mendocino and Lake Sonoma. Map by . The water agency’s main job is to provide drinking water to about 600,000 people living and working in California’s Sonoma and Marin counties. Working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the agency helps operate two dams in the Russian River watershed: the Coyote Valley and Warm Springs dams. The agency also supports local stormwater and wastewater systems that are outside the jurisdiction of local communities, such as the City of Santa Rosa. But since water is vital for many facets of life in Sonoma County, the agency is involved in a range of projects all closely tied to maintaining a healthy and sustainable river: carbon mitigation and clean energy generation projects aimed at improving the water system’s energy efficiency; water conservation initiatives; fisheries research and monitoring activities; and serving the needs of the region’s water-dependent industries, such as farmers, winegrowers, and other business owners. If the water managers do their job right, none of these interests have to suffer a lack of water. During the dry period of the year, the agency turns to two major reservoirs: Lake Mendocino and Lake Sonoma. The agency releases water from the reservoirs throughout the summer to ensure that they meet the minimum streamflow in the river that is mandated by the California State Water Resources Control Board. Engineers also inflate a giant rubber barrier in the river that slows down the water, allowing more of it to be diverted at the agency’s collection system located along the river bank. The Sonoma County Water Agency operates an inflatable dam on the Russian River to increase production capacity during peak demand months. Permanent fish ladders on the side of the river allow fish swim past the barrier when it is inflated.  photo by Caitlyn Kennedy. A secure water supply is critical for people living in Sonoma County during the summer when the only other relief from the hot sun is a dip in the river itself. During the winter, however, the Pacific goes into overdrive, churning up giant storms off the coast. Then, the agency’s focus turns to safeguarding the river against too much water. March",

When those trees die, however, marsh plants will grow in around them. “You can see, essentially, the habitat transition in action. I mean, you can see that line of dying trees. You can see the marsh encroaching,” Whitbeck says. “It’s happening in front of our eyes.” The driving force behind these transitions is sea level rise — brought on by manmade climate change and the sinking of land surfaces around the Eastern Shore. Rising waters have claimed more than 5,000 acres of marshland in the refuge since it was established in the",

In the natural world, rising sea level is a stressor on coastal ecosystems that provide recreation, protection from storms, and habitat for fish and wildlife, including commercially valuable fisheries. As seas rise, saltwater is intruding into freshwater aquifers, many of which sustain municipal and agricultural water supplies and natural ecosystems. Even though the oceans are all connected, sea level does not rise or fall uniformly over the planet. On a yearly basis, differences in sea level from place to place are largely due to shifts in the position or strength of major currents or natural climate patterns.

RVF outbreaks in East Africa occur during specific environmental conditions: heavy rains and vegetation overgrowth in areas with low grassland depressions. To predict when an RVF outbreak could occur, scientists have identified climate patterns that cause these conditions. The strong, ongoing El Niño event leaves East Africa in danger of an RVF outbreak this year. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a deadly mosquito-borne disease that affects both humans and valuable livestock in Africa. The fever-causing virus affects the local population and domestic animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels. Occurring in years of unusually heavy rainfall, the flooding caused by these rains provides an ideal environment for naturally infected mosquito eggs to hatch. The virus is difficult to control because infected mosquito eggs can survive for years in the normally dry soil. After infection, animals develop high levels of the virus in their blood, thus infecting previously unaffected mosquitoes, which then infect other animals and humans. People can catch RVF either from the bite of a mosquito or through direct contact with the blood, milk, or meat of infected animals, which for many people are a primary source of milk and food. The ecological cycle of the Rift Valley Fever virus. Credit: Centers for Disease Control. While most people infected with the virus don’t show any sign of the disease, rarely—about 1 percent of cases—an infected person can develop blindness, swelling of the brain, and hemorrhagic fever. In livestock, the virus is much more serious. Many infected animals, especially the young, die from the disease; almost all infected pregnant animals miscarry. Once an outbreak in the animal population (known as an epizootic event) occurs, it’s too late to administer action such as livestock vaccines or larval insecticides that kill the infected mosquito population. Humans can try to limit their exposure to the mosquitoes and infected livestock to prevent their own infection, but the livestock mortality rate for infected livestock is more than 90 percent in newborns and 10-30 percent in adult animals.

That period of time is known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM for short. It was one of the warmest periods in Earth history. Global temperatures likely rose by 9 to 14°F (5 to 8°C) for thousands of years. Geologists and paleontologists have known about the high temperatures for decades, but questions remain. How did the spike affect life on Earth? Could it happen again? Deep ocean temperatures were generally high throughout the Paleocene and Eocene, with a particularly warm spike at the boundary between the two geological epochs around 56 million years ago.

    "content": "NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research published a new story on the NOAA website today about a volunteer \"citizen science\" project that took place this summer to create highly detailed maps of the urban heat island effect in Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD. According to the story… on one of the hottest days of summer, people in some Baltimore neighborhoods sweltered in temperatures of 103 degrees F, some 17 degrees higher than the coolest parts of the city at the same time in the afternoon. A similar pattern took place in D.C. a day earlier when temperatures soared to 102 degrees F in several neighborhoods, while other parts of the city were 16 degrees cooler. In support of that story, the Climate.gov team produced maps of the data and paired them with matching satellite images of each city so that readers can get a sense of how and why each city experiences such a wide range of temperatures on a hot summer day. For each city, the temperature data are colored in shades of blue (coolest half of the day's temperature range) to red (warmest half). In the satellite images, patches of woods, parks, and other vegetation are shades of green, while pavement, buildings and other developed areas are shades of white and gray. Grab and drag the sliders to compare the temperature maps (left) to the satellite views (right). Download large versions: DC | Baltimore. At the northern edge of the DC city limits, Rock Creek Park crowns the city's cool northwest, which stretches from the park down to the Potomac River, which forms the city's border with Virginia. The hottest areas of the city on this day were in the city's northeast, between Rt. 1 and Rt. 29 (which runs north of the city into Silver Spring, MD). Silver Spring and other northern suburbs look like warm balloons tethered to the city by warm strings of roadway. The influence of roadways on temperature patterns is clear in the Baltimore map, too. The metro area's densest development, and hottest areas, are in the center of the image, with warm areas extending southward on either side of the Patapsco River. Both inside and outside the city's Beltway, communities like Pimlico, Towson, and Nottingham stand out as warm spots, connected back to the warm urban core by narrow ribbons of warmth. The OAR story said, NOAA and its partners are sharing the maps and data with officials in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore who have expressed interest in using them to help plan cooling strategies and inform resiliency plans. The team is also developing a strategy by which many more urban heat island mapping campaigns can be conducted in other cities across the United States in the summer of",

    "content": "Compared to the Arctic, Antarctica is responding less rapidly to climate change. Water’s melting point, 32°F, is a critical threshold for rapid change in polar regions, and only a small fraction of the snow on Antarctica’s miles-high ice sheet reaches that temperature in summer. Antarctica is also surrounded by a vast ocean, and it’s buffered by winds and weather patterns that tend to isolate it from large warm-air intrusions. Still, the frozen continent has become warmer, and has lost billions of tons of ice as a result. Its future responses to warming air and ocean could have worldwide consequences. A portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (background) drains into the ice-covered Bellinghausen Sea (foreground) via an S-shaped glacier (center). The top of the glacier is rippled with crevasses, indicating the ice is flowing quickly over steep terrain. NASA Operation IceBridge photo by Kate Ramsayer. Though it’s about as far from the equator as the Arctic, and though it’s also largely frozen, Antarctica is in many ways the Arctic’s opposite. The Arctic is an ice-covered ocean basin surrounded by landmasses; Antarctica is a continent surrounded by a vast ocean. Roughly the size of the contiguous United States and Mexico combined, Antarctica extends from 60°S to the South Pole. Most of the continent lies within the Antarctic Circle, 66°33'39\" south of the Equator. Geographers divide the continent into three regions: East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula. Geographers divide Antarctica into three regions: East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Transantarctic Mountains separate the eastern and western parts of the continent. Ice shelves fringe the continent, the two largest being the Ronne and the Ross. Among the nearby seas are the Amundsen, Bellinghausen, Davis, Ross, and Weddell, and Antarctica is surrounded by the vast Southern Ocean. Separating East and West Antarctica, the Transantarctic Mountains include peaks over 14,000 feet, and an even higher peak—16,000+-foot Mt Vinson—rises near the Antarctic Peninsula. But mountains aren’t what make Antarctica the highest-elevation continent on Earth. Ice is. Thanks to thick ice, Antarctic elevation averages more than 6,000 feet (more than a mile above sea level). The very highest parts of the ice sheet, near the center of East Antarctica, rival the height of its tallest mountains, at nearly 13,500 feet. At South Pole Station, the average monthly summer temperature is −18°F, and the average winter monthly temperature is −76°F, according to the U.S. Antarctic Program. These temperatures are much colder than the North Pole’s, which averages −40°F in winter and 32°F—right on the cusp of melting—in summer. In fact, Antarctica is home to the coldest place on Earth. Located at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica's Amundsen-Scott research station is a tiny human outpost on a vast ice sheet that seems to stretch unbroken to the horizon. Image courtesy the National Science Foundation. Antarctica’s interior gets so little precipitation that it counts among the world’s driest deserts. Air masses reaching the high-elevation interior are usually stripped of moisture. The U.S. Antarctic Program reports that, continent-wide, Antarctica receives an average of roughly 2 inches of precipitation per year. (Phoenix, Arizona, gets about 7.5 inches of annual precipitation.) But intense storms with hurricane-force winds near the coasts may drop heavy precipitation around the steep margins of the continent—up to 10 feet of water as snowfall!

Native seaweed has the potential to be cultivated in California coastal waters and used to alleviate the effects of local ocean acidification, according to a new study funded by NOAA's California Sea Grant. Besides providing a local and sustainable source of food, researchers and aquaculture producers are exploring how seaweed production may benefit its surrounding environment. “We were interested in how seaweed can help moderate the acidity of the water that it is grown in and how it can be used as a nutrient absorption tool,” said project leader Catherine O’Hare. She co-founded the Salt Point Seaweed Company which makes culinary products from wild harvested seaweed from the north coast of California. Along with co-founders Tessa Emmer and Avery Resor, the woman-owned company is conducting seaweed cultivation research in California. The team currently gather nori, kombu, and wakame seaweeds by hand in northern Mendocino County, but are conscious of potential ecological impacts if they were to grow their operation says O’Hare. She says their long-term vision is to create food products sourced solely from farmed seaweed. Avery Resor and Catherine O'Hare check on the health of their Gracilaria crop, growing attached to a long line of rope submerged at Hog Island Oyster Farm. Photo by Shaun Wolfe. O’Hare and her colleagues were first introduced to seaweed farming in Zanzibar, an island off Tanzania. The seaweed is cultivated in small-scale operations and mostly grown for food additives like agar and carrageenan. After their experiences in East Africa, O’Hare says she and her cofounders began to consider the feasibility of seaweed aquaculture in California. Though the trio had come from different backgrounds, they all had experience in agriculture and an interest in sustainable food supply chains. “I’ve always been interested in things revolving around the coast. Once I moved to the Bay Area, I started seaweed harvesting with a fishing license as a hobby. Seaweed, for me, is the combination of my love of the ocean and my background in farming and food production,” said O’Hare. The pilot project took place in Tomales Bay, northwest of San Francisco, on an oyster farm with an existing easement—and a shared interest in learning whether native kelp growing could combat ocean acidification and improve water quality. Google Earth image, based on data from SIO, NOAA, U.S. Navy, NGA, GEBCO, CSUMB SFML, and CA OPC. There were no existing seaweed farming models in the coastal waters of California to research or replicate, and limited data pertaining to the general cultivation of native California seaweed species. Inspired by research happening in New England, the entrepreneurs wanted to look at the carbon and nitrogen absorption capacity of seaweed indigenous to the region. For the pilot project, the researchers grew the native red algae Gracilariopsis andersonii in Tomales Bay, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean 30 miles northwest of San Francisco. The research was completed in partnership with Hog Island Oyster Co., on the existing aquaculture lease and with the shellfish company’s support. Hog Island, in northern Tomales Bay. The long and narrow bay supports commercial oyster farms, and the surrounding hills are home to dairy cattle. Soil erosion, manure, and inadequate septic systems have all caused water quality problems in the bay. Photo by Jeff Boyd, used via a Creative Commons license. The seaweed samples were then sent to UC Davis for carbon and nitrogen analysis. Results were comparable to analyses conducted on farmed seaweed on the East Coast, and showed the seaweed successfully removed carbon and nitrogen from the surrounding water. Seaweed production may have positive impacts on both climate change mitigation and ecosystem management. “A growing body of scientific research indicates seaweed aquaculture can provide ecosystem services that contribute to the reduction of local ocean acidification and assist with pollution remediation,” said California Sea Grant Aquaculture Specialist and Scripps Institution of Oceanography/Moss Landing Marine Laboratories researcher Luke Gardner. Seawater chemistry is changing as human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere. When the gas dissolves into the ocean, it reacts with seawater to make the water more acidic. The resulting consequence is known as ocean acidification, and it threatens marine life, altering the availability of shell-forming minerals needed by organisms like clams and mussels.

Previous studies have shown that seaweed has the potential to combat adverse impacts of ocean acidification and remove some of the carbon dioxide that’s already in the atmosphere and ocean. Kelp, a type of large brown seaweed, is estimated to take in five times more carbon than most land-based plants. Research has also shown that seaweed can help manage water quality by absorbing excess nutrient pollution from wastewater treatment facilities, urban storm water runoff, and farming. Seaweed aquaculture is also drawing significant attention throughout the state. In the State of California Ocean Acidification Action Plan published in",

    "date": null,
    "content": "In late February, as the Southern Plains and Gulf Coast suffered through an unusually strong blast of wintry weather, weather talk turned to the polar vortex and the possibility that the extreme cold was yet another example of weather-gone-wild due to global warming. In this article, we’re talking to two NOAA experts about the devastating extreme cold event, the polar vortex, and the potential link to global warming. The Arctic polar vortex is a band of strong westerly winds that forms in the stratosphere between about 10 and 30 miles above the North Pole every winter. The winds enclose a large pool of extremely cold air. (There is an even stronger polar vortex in the Southern Hemisphere stratosphere in its winter.) The stronger the winds, the more the air inside is isolated from warmer latitudes, and the colder it gets. When the Arctic polar vortex is especially strong and stable (left globe), it encourages the polar jet stream, down in the troposphere, to shift northward. The coldest polar air stays in the Arctic. When the vortex weakens, shifts, or splits (right globe), the polar jet stream often becomes extremely wavy, allowing warm air to flood into the Arctic and polar air to sink down into the mid-latitudes.  graphic, adapted from original by NOAA.gov. According to NOAA stratosphere expert Amy Butler, people often confuse the polar vortex with the polar jet stream, but the two are in completely separate layers of the atmosphere. The polar jet stream occurs in the troposphere, at altitudes between 5-9 miles above the surface. It marks the boundary between surface air masses, separating warmer, mid-latitude air and colder, polar air. It’s the polar jet stream that plays such a big role in our day-to-day winter weather in the mid-latitudes, not the polar vortex. The polar vortex doesn’t always influence winter weather in the mid-latitudes. When it does, however, the effects can be extreme. When the polar vortex is especially strong, for example, the polar jet steam tends to stay farther north and to exhibit a more zonal flow, with less meandering. At the surface, this stable stratospheric state is often associated with an even colder than usual Arctic, and milder-than-usual weather in the mid-latitudes. The Arctic Oscillation, which tracks hemisphere-scale wind and air pressure patterns, is often positive. At the other extreme, the polar vortex is occasionally knocked off kilter when especially strong atmospheric waves in the troposphere break upward into the stratosphere. The vortex slows, and it may wobble, slide off the pole, split into several lobes, or—in the most extreme cases—temporarily reverse direction. Regardless of their “flavor,” these disruptions have one thing in common: a spike in polar stratosphere temperatures, which is why they’re called sudden stratospheric warmings. In the weeks following the stratospheric upheaval, the polar jet stream will often develop a wavy shape, with deep troughs and steep ridges that can become nearly stationary for days. The exact nature of the interaction—how the polar jet “feels” the disruption in the polar vortex and why it reacts the way it does—isn’t fully understood. Under the high-pressure ridges, warm air floods north into parts of the Arctic, often driving extreme melt, while polar air fills the low-pressure troughs, bringing wintry conditions farther south than average. The Arctic Oscillation often slips into its negative phase. Temperature (purple is cooler, pink is warmer) and winds (white lines) at the 250-millibar pressure level (the altitude at which the pressure is 250 millibars), showing the deeply wavy path of the polar jet stream across the United States on February 15,",

The destructive power of individual TCs through flooding is amplified by rising sea level, which very likely has a substantial contribution at the global scale from anthropogenic climate change.

    "content": "Blue carbon refers to carbon dioxide that is absorbed from the atmosphere and stored in the ocean. “Blue” refers to the watery nature of this storage. The vast majority of blue carbon is carbon dioxide that has dissolved directly into the ocean. Much smaller amounts are stored in underwater sediments, coastal vegetation and soils; carbon-containing molecules, such as DNA and proteins; and ocean life from whales to phytoplankton. International agreements aimed at curbing climate change have focused growing attention on coastal blue carbon: carbon stored by saltwater ecosystems in their vegetation and soils. In terms of total area, these ecosystems—salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass meadows—have a small global footprint, but their deep, water-logged soils can bury many times more carbon per acre than even a tropical rainforest. A channel through a salt marsh on the Lancashire coast of England reveals a thick layer of mud beneath a thin covering of plants. Photo by Julia Gillen. Used under a Creative Commons license. Coastal ecosystems’ carbon-storing power is a double-edged sword because when they are disturbed or drained, they can release surprisingly large amounts of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. But protected or restored, they can become an important tool for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions, especially for island nations and developing countries whose greenhouse gas emissions are relatively low. And because these ecosystems have multiple other benefits—from wildlife habitat to hurricane protection—strategies for protecting and restoring coastal blue-carbon ecosystems are likely to play a growing role in U.S. and international climate policy in coming years. When experts talk about the carbon storage potential of coastal blue-carbon ecosystems, they usually mean salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. Seagrass beds consist of flowering plants that grow in salty marine environments. Mangroves are trees, shrubs, or palms that mostly grow in coastal swamps prone to flooding by salt water at high tide. Salt marshes are dense configurations of salt-tolerant grasses, herbs, and/or shrubs that flourish between land and open salt water. Coastal blue carbon refers to the carbon stored in the vegetation and soils of salt marshes (left), like this one at Assateague Island on the Maryland-Virginia shore; seagrass meadows (center), like this one in Tonga, in the South Pacific; and mangrove forests (right), like this one in Queensland, Australia. Photo by (left to right) Zach Frailey, Steven Lutz/GRID-Arendal, and David Unger. Used under a Creative Commons license. All kinds of vegetation absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide and use it to build their roots, leaves, and other parts. Animals eat plants and spread the captured carbon throughout the ecosystem. When living things die, their remains usually land in the soil. On land, oxygen-using microbes typically go to work on those carbon-rich remains right away, breaking down dead matter and releasing carbon dioxide in the process. But in places where the soils are flooded, oxygen levels are low, and decomposition happens more slowly. Plants and trees in coastal ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Some of that carbon returns to the atmosphere as methane and carbon dioxide, but some is buried in the soil and some is carried farther away and buried in ocean sediments. Cut off from the atmosphere, these underwater soils and sediments make an excellent long-term sink for carbon.  graphic adapted from original by Sarah Battle, NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. Undisturbed, those soils can hang onto atmospheric carbon for centuries or even millennia. Degraded or drained, they can quickly turn into a carbon source. Not only do the plants stop growing and capturing carbon, but exposure of blue-carbon soils to oxygen can lead rapidly to microbial decomposition of organic matter and release of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Seaweeds like kelp (scientists refer to them as “macroalgae”) are often left out of blue carbon discussions because accounting for the long-term fate of the carbon they store is tricky. Growing with astonishing speed—up to an average of 11 inches (28 centimeters) per day—kelp consumes plenty of carbon dioxide. But it often grows in rocky coastal areas where the build-up of carbon-rich soil is minimal. Instead, most of the carbon that kelp sequesters is exported to other places as pieces of kelp break off and drift away: to other vegetated coastal ecosystems, to nearby sediments on the coastal shelf, and to the deep ocean. Buried in deep seafloor sediments, kelp carbon can remain for thousands of years. Kelp exposed at low tide on Alaska's Kiska Island. Kelp usually grows in rocky places where carbon-rich soils are minimal. That makes it harder to know how much of the carbon they capture remains stored for the long-term. Photo by Brian Hoffman.

Rough estimates suggest that the amount of carbon absorbed by kelp ecosystems each year could be larger than the amount stored by other coastal blue-carbon ecosystems. In addition, kelp can be farmed and harvested for food or other plant-based products. Kelp farming has also shown promise in reducing the impacts of ocean acidification in oyster habitat. But because of the complexity and uncertainty about where carbon stored by kelp ends up, scientists haven’t yet included kelp forests and other macroalgae in plans and policies for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. If we want to stop further global warming, we have to stop adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than natural processes can remove. As part of this carbon accounting, all the countries that are participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have agreed to publish an annual inventory of how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases they emit (“sources”) as well as how much carbon dioxide they think they have removed from the atmosphere (“sinks”) through things like forest protection or restoration. The treaty allows countries to trade with each other on the “carbon market,” in which a country’s activities to reduce emissions or protect natural carbon sinks become currency that it uses to offset its own emissions or to trade with other countries. Global map of average annual carbon storage potential by coastal ecosystems world wide in millions of tonnes of carbon per year. Estimates range from up to 0.15 million tonnes per year (lightest green) around Greenland, the west coast of South America, and around Antarctica, to up to 11 million tonnes per year (dark blue) around Australia, Indonesia, and the United States. These data are part of an analysis of which countries are donating natural carbon-storage services to the planet and which countries are recipients of other countries' natural services.

    "date": null,
    "content": "Woven into each step of Barbara Wortham’s early yet already diverse climate science career is an effort to link Earth’s past and future in meaningful ways. Barbara, who goes by Babs, is a recent fellow of the NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and a self-proclaimed nerd with a passion for building histories of carbon dioxide and climate. Constructing records of climate in the past when no one was around to take measurements is a science called paleoclimate. Among the many potential challenges of modern climate change are more frequent and severe droughts and unpredictable precipitation patterns, and Babs is most excited about work that helps us understand those processes. By developing an understanding of the past, researchers can learn about present and future conditions in the context of climate trends over centuries or millennia. “Paleoclimate is that lens to better understand climate change,” Babs says. Babs became interested in environmental science as an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin’s Environmental Science Institute, where she recalls she was first drawn to paleoclimate by studying natural records in caves. Cave research allowed her to study human impacts on climate and interactions with the environment alongside natural climate variability processes. \"The combo fascinated me,” she said. Babs in front of a calcite deposit in a California cave system. Photo by Greg Roemer. Her cave research continued all over the world, and she even spent some time living in São Paulo, Brazil to continue the work. Babs also pursued paleoclimate with research at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California, studying whole trees that were preserved from the last ice age. Whether she is using caves or trees as a science tool, Babs has a specific snapshot of the past that helps us to understand how our climate could change in the future. Mineral deposits in caves, like stalagmites and stalactites, can reveal a history of changes in the local environment of the immediate surrounding area. Water infiltrating through the ground picks up carbon dioxide on its way, becoming slightly acidic. The acidic water dissolves calcium carbonate minerals in rock, trickles into caves, and deposits the minerals to build up cave formations, sometimes in orderly, seasonal layers. The formations also include oxygen from the time the mineral was deposited, which provides clues to paleoclimatologists like Babs to reconstruct larger-scale climate patterns. The amount of water that flows into the cave impacts the way the minerals form, allowing scientists to interpret clues about heavy rainfall events and droughts in the area. David Angel and Babs are looking at a thermometer after taking air temperature and water temperature measurements in a California cave. Photo by Greg Roemer. David and Greg are part of the Cave Research Foundation. Babs recounts the beginning of her caving career, when a trip to a cave in central Texas piqued her interest because there were fossils inside as well as evidence of how humans had changed the landscape. The cave was discovered during work to build a new highway across central Texas, and a variety of vertebrate fossils were recovered, including mammoths and saber-toothed cats. Researchers found that the cave had recorded soil thickness through time, showing how the surrounding land was changed for different uses. “Standing in one place that houses Texas history as well as evolution history amazed me,” Babs remembers. “Also, they’re spectacular to look at. I just kept wanting to see more caves, which drove me to keep working in a field where I could.” Babs pivoted her research focus, not because she became uninterested in caves, but rather to explore the link between carbon dioxide, the water cycle, and living things. While she was a NOAA Climate and Global Change fellow, she studied climate through the lens of Juniper trees that were preserved in the La Brea Tar Pits from the last period in which glaciers covered much of the Northern Hemisphere. Located in urban Los Angeles, California, sticky pools of natural asphalt formed by crude oil that has made its way to Earth’s surface have preserved many species of plants and animals shockingly well, creating a perfect testing ground for paleontology and paleoclimatology. The fellowship allowed Babs to pursue this work at The University of California, Berkeley. The natural asphalt seeps at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, CA, harbor a bonanza of Ice Age fossils of both prey animals like mammoths and their predators, including saber-tooth carts and dire wolves.

Used under a Creative Commons license. “At La Brea, there are trees archived that are from 50 thousand years ago! When we find these trees we can look at the chemical composition of their wood to understand how they grew,” Babs said. Cylinders of cored samples from the preserved trees show layers of wood growth, which are related to the conditions surrounding the tree during its life. Tree core sample from the La Brea Tar Pits. Photo by Aisling Farrell. “When trees are stressed, a chemical signal is left behind in the wood.” Babs explains that examining this wood provides clues about how the biosphere is linked to global climate through stressors on the tree like limited water, fire, and long term changes in carbon dioxide. She continues, “See, trees depend on carbon dioxide for their photosynthesis cycles and when they don’t have it, it can stress them out. We attempted to try and reconstruct those cycles of stress in the trees and map it to global climate change processes.” To be clear, the question Babs is exploring is not whether trees record the stress of past climate changes in their growth rings or other characteristics. That connection is well established: cooler and drier conditions have a predictable negative impact on growth rates and tree rings. What hasn’t yet been established, however, is whether it’s also possible to use data like the La Brea trees to detect the direct physiological impact of lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on tree growth. Detecting the effects of limited carbon dioxide for trees is a relatively new and speculative idea, but that was the exciting part for Babs, as she focused many of her experiments on pushing paleoclimate methods to new levels. Many of the accepted methods using both caves and trees lead to relative results, and Babs worked to develop ways to draw quantitative conclusions, or specific measurable outcomes. Babs samples trees from the LaBrea Tar Pits. Photo by Aisling Farrell. Carbon dioxide is climate change’s big driving force. While we need carbon dioxide in our atmosphere to regulate global temperature, additional carbon dioxide causes temperature to increase. This is happening today at a faster rate than in the past million years or so as humans continue to burn fossil fuels and make dramatic landscape changes. Questions remain about how these rapid increases in carbon dioxide will impact other important aspects of our Earth system, like precipitation patterns, and how that in turn will impact plants. To answer these questions, Barbara is looking at other periods in Earth’s history when a rapid change in carbon dioxide was accompanied by a temperature change. Babs makes a good case for using the last glaciation of the most recent ice age, preserved in the La Brea Tar Pits, as an analog to today. Though the changes to the atmosphere during the ice age occurred at a slower rate than the climate change we are observing today, our ability to assess the way Earth systems behaved and reacted to carbon dioxide trends from paleoclimate records is valuable. “This period when carbon dioxide was low, about twenty to thirty thousand years ago, and rapidly increasing to pre-anthropogenic levels is a natural laboratory for us to ask the question: what happens to the precipitation patterns and biosphere when we change carbon dioxide quickly?” Though her source material is far in the past, Babs’ work addresses some of the most pressing uncertainties in modern climate science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report points to opportunities to expand our understanding of changes in the present and future water cycle, especially related to its response to rapidly increasing carbon dioxide. Babs has worked to fill those knowledge gaps, which will bolster our ability to plan for a changing climate. Paleoclimate has taught us much of what we know about global climate change, and continues to shed light on how our Earth systems may change over time. This information can also offer guidance for local decision making. “Paleoclimate records are inherently local, so they can provide information on how climate change gets translated on a local scale—a very important topic for folks who may think about local climate change policy,” says Babs. She offers the overarching importance of this work with a healthy dose of harsh reality. “It’s crucial to use these periods in the past to understand what kind of changes we can expect and to determine how quickly the biosphere is able to adapt, or in many cases, not adapt.” The NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program supported Babs while she continued her paleoclimate work, but also provided professional development. “The thing I most appreciate about the C&GC fellowship was that it allowed me to form professional connections with a group of peers and mentors that I would have otherwise never had the opportunity to meet. The C&GC program does an excellent job at building community. Because of that I will value my relationships with the other fellows forever,” she says. Through her research, Babs noticed a barrier between academic science and direct impact, and she again wanted to work toward filling that important gap. Working now as manager in the climate change division of a consulting firm, Babs is able to connect the dots between what companies know about, care about, and act upon. This new position allows Babs to continue using her understanding of the Earth’s past, present and future to inspire meaningful action in a changing climate.

    "content": "Nearly 100 NOAA scientists and staff contributed to the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Among this group were 35 authors, 13 chapter leaders, 20 members of NOAA’s technical support team, technical contributors and reviewers. We caught up recently with five NOAA scientists who served as Coordinating Lead Authors on selected chapters of the report. We asked them about the importance of this work, key challenges discussed in their chapters, and what drove each to lead a team of cross-disciplinary authors to produce the nation’s most up-to-date and authoritative report on climate change in the United States. Coordinating lead author for the Oceans and Marine Resources chapter from NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory For Osborne, this was a way she could connect science to decision-makers and the general public. “Key climate communication tools like the National Climate Assessment ensure the public has access to the latest information in a digestible way,” she said. Emily Osborne, scientist at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, samples ocean water on a field mission to study ocean acidification. Photo courtesy of Emily Osborne Key messages: There’s overwhelming evidence that climate change, through ocean warming, changes in oxygen and pH, extreme events, and other human-caused effects, has and will continue to have significant impacts on United States marine ecosystems. Climate change poses substantial risks to ocean-related industries such as fisheries, tourism, recreation, transportation and energy. What we do today, to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate carbon dioxide, and adapt by building more resilient communities and economies, will determine how climate change will impact our ocean and many people, businesses and communities. Key challenges: Additional scientific observations are required to deliver the robust early warnings and to improve longer-term projections. Climate change disproportionately impacts historically underserved groups such as Black, Indigenous and people of color, which emphasizes the need to ensure that climate information is equitably shared and accessible. Enduring and equitable outcomes will be achieved when all are at the table to develop adaptation and resilience plans. Promising adaptation: Development of fisheries management approaches that use ocean climate projections to assess risks and sustainable fisheries strategies, decarbonization of the maritime transport sector, and investment in researching and expansion of ocean-based solutions such as renewable energy such as offshore wind and marine carbon dioxide removal, which involves using the ocean to draw down carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Coordinating lead author of the Coastal Effects chapter and NOAA’s National Ocean Service Senior Advisor for Coastal Inundation and Resilience Osler relished the opportunity to work with some of the nation’s greatest experts in this field to communicate how our coasts are changing, why it matters, and how we as a nation can rise to meet the challenges. Mark Osler, scientist with NOAA’s National Ocean Service, talks with Megan Tyrell, director of research for the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Falmouth, Massachusetts, about the value of healthy salt marshes to store carbon and provide coastal resilience from storms. Photo courtesy of Mark Osler. Key messages: Climate impacts, including rising sea levels and shifting storm patterns, are transforming coastal landscapes and undermining the resilience of communities and ecosystems. Proactive community-led adaptation strategies, including nature-based solutions and planned relocation where appropriate, can help communities adapt to both current and future increases in the severity of coastal hazards across the U.S. Key challenges: Building the local and regional capacity needed to define equitable risk reduction approaches, securing funding, and maintaining support for these approaches from the public and elected officials remains a national priority. Promising adaptation: The chapter highlights a success story taking place in Norfolk, Virginia, a community experiencing some of the highest rates of sea level rise in the nation.The Ohio Creek watershed project, funded by a $112 million National Disaster Resilience Competition grant, is addressing the high-tide flooding, storm flooding and shoreline erosion in neighborhoods that are predominantly Black and include a public housing development as well as many homes on the National Historic Register. The success story is made possible by strong leadership from the local government, community involvement, federal and non-profit investment, world class climate information from the federal and academic science community, and private sector expertise for implementation.

Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) refers to deliberate, large-scale actions intended to decrease global average surface temperatures by increasing the reflection of sunlight away from the Earth. Proposed SRM methods involve the use of aerosols (small particles) or other materials to increase the reflectivity of the atmosphere, clouds, or Earth’s surface. These methods have the potential to lower surface temperatures more quickly than carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods and reduce some risks posed by climate change, while posing other risks still to be understood. The single largest driver of climate change in the industrial era has been human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a long-lived greenhouse gas (GHG). Long-term protection of Earth’s climate and oceans requires substantial reductions in emissions and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other GHGs. SRM is not considered a substitute for climate mitigation efforts, which include decarbonization and GHG emission cuts. SRM research is being conducted as a response to growing concerns that the pace of CO2 emissions reductions and CDR technology development is not sufficient to avoid severe impacts of climate change in the next decades. Research into the viability and effectiveness of SRM methods and potential unintended consequences provide a foundation for decisions regarding the implementation of SRM. SRM methods cool the surface by preventing a portion of incoming solar radiation from reaching Earth’s surface. By contrast, GHGs warm surface temperatures by trapping a portion of outgoing terrestrial radiation that would otherwise be emitted into space. SRM methods reduce surface warming without addressing the fundamental cause—rising levels of atmospheric GHGs—and thus do not offset all of the impacts of carbon emissions. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) and marine cloud brightening (MCB) are the SRM methods that have garnered the most interest and have been the subject of the most research based on a combination of projected feasibility and estimated cost. To date, far less research has been performed on other proposed methods for modifying Earth’s radiation budget (Figure 1). Figure 1. Proposed methods for modifying Earth’s radiation budget, including SRM methods and cirrus cloud thinning. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI): a strategy for increasing the number of small reflective aerosols in the stratosphere to increase the reflection of incoming sunlight. Marine cloud brightening (MCB): a strategy for adding aerosol to the lower atmosphere over ocean regions to increase the reflectivity of low-lying marine clouds. Cirrus cloud thinning (CCT): a strategy for modifying the properties of high altitude ice clouds to increase the transmission of outgoing terrestrial radiation to space. Surface albedo enhancement: increasing the reflectivity of surfaces through, for example, white roofs or land-cover changes. Space-based methods: proposed methods have primarily considered large “mirrors” in space to reflect sunlight. SAI involves increasing the abundance of stratospheric aerosols that reflect sunlight either by direct injection or by injection of a precursor gas (such as sulfur dioxide, SO2) that would subsequently react in the stratosphere to form aerosols. Proposed aerosol types include sulfate, calcium carbonate, and diamond dust. MCB involves injecting sea salt aerosol into low-level marine clouds to increase cloud reflectivity by increasing the number of small cloud droplets. Analogs to SAI (e.g., volcanic eruptions) and MCB (e.g., ship tracks) provide a scientific basis for understanding the main principles of SRM. Extensive research efforts are underway in the scientific community to gain a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility, risks, benefits, and negative consequences of possible SRM strategies to reduce surface temperatures. SRM research centers on developing and studying a range of potential future scenarios that combine emissions reductions, CDR, and SRM to varying degrees and over varying timescales. In one such scenario, commonly called “peak-shaving” (illustrated in Figure 2), SRM would be implemented as a temporary method alongside strong GHG emission cuts and aggressive CDR to stabilize global temperatures and offset some of the most negative impacts of climate change. Figure 2. Schematic diagram representing the concept of peak-shaving. Different lines illustrate the global mean temperatures for future scenarios. Blue arrows represent the relative magnitude of the temperature impact of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). SRM deployments large enough to temporarily offset climate change impacts could have substantial risks and unintended and unexpected consequences. Side effects of SRM are driven by complex chemical, radiative, and dynamical interactions, such as changes to the hydrologic cycle and clouds, or effects on ecosystems, agricultural production, and the carbon cycle. Additional impacts on the protective stratospheric ozone layer by SAI and alterations to the El Niño Southern Oscillation by MCB are also possible. The potential risks and benefits to human health and well-being and to ecosystems from SRM need to be evaluated and assessed relative to those associated with plausible trajectories of ongoing climate change without SRM (i.e., using risk vs. risk analysis). Current understanding of risks and benefits is limited by uncertainties in the observations and modeling tools used to examine SRM impacts. GHG-induced warming and SRM-induced cooling are different physical mechanisms; therefore, SRM would not simply undo GHG-induced warming and cannot reverse all climate changes everywhere. In fact, effects of climate change on regional weather patterns will not be fully mitigated by SRM. Some regions could experience cooler or wetter conditions, and others warmer or drier conditions, compared to a climate without SRM. In addition, ocean acidification will persist unabated if GHG emissions continue. Importantly, both the effectiveness of SRM in offsetting the impacts of global warming and the potential unintended consequences depend on how and when SRM is deployed. Recent studies on SRM indicate that some of the negative impacts can be reduced through design of an optimal injection strategy (i.e. location, magnitude, and timing of injection). Substantial modeling efforts to understand the processes and impacts of both SAI and MCB are ongoing. These efforts have demonstrated the basic efficacy of SRM for cooling Earth’s surface temperatures, while also identifying a number of gaps and uncertainties in our current understanding, as well as potential unintended outcomes. Many of the processes most important for understanding SRM approaches—such as those that control the formation of clouds and aerosols—are among the most uncertain components of the climate system. Climate models differ in simulating large-scale aerosol climate effects, including on surface temperatures, due to variations in how aerosol processes, atmospheric transport and mixing, and physics are represented. There remain large uncertainties as to the changes in large scale circulation, regional climate, air quality, and weather, associated with SRM. Research on low-level clouds has also revealed complex interactions with aerosols, so the net climate effect of injecting aerosols into the lower atmosphere for MCB is difficult to project. Improving understanding of these fundamental processes requires expanded atmospheric observations and innovations in modeling. A fundamental challenge of SRM is the technological requirement to implement any strategy at the scale required to achieve appreciable global cooling. Both SAI and MCB would require development of reliable methods for producing aerosols of a specific size and uniformity, in addition to the platforms/vehicles needed for deployment (e.g., ships, high altitude aircraft/balloons). Aerosols are removed from the atmosphere by natural processes on timescales of a few days in the troposphere and a few years in the stratosphere. An SRM strategy like peak-shaving would require ongoing deployment until such time that the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are sufficiently reduced. Ceasing actions abruptly when injections are large could lead to a more rapid climate change (termination shock) than would have occurred in the absence of SRM. SRM also raises concerns of intergenerational equity by committing future generations to continue on a path they did not choose. Climate change raises geopolitical risks, and SRM deployment could also add significant geopolitical risks. Implementing SRM may positively impact some locations and negatively impact others. This uneven distribution of benefits and negative consequences introduces potentially significant justice and geopolitical concerns. Currently, no universally accepted governance framework provides oversight for SRM research or implementation. Substantial knowledge gaps and uncertainties exist in many critical areas of SRM research, particularly related to the social sciences. NOAA is engaged in a range of SRM research activities including modeling, laboratory experiments, and measurements of current atmospheric conditions. All activities occur within existing authorizations for Federal science agencies. The US Government is not engaged in any form of outdoor testing or deployment of SRM techniques and does not condone or endorse SRM deployment. Any activities intending to modify weather or Earth’s solar radiation (i.e., SRM) are required to be reported to NOAA under the Weather Modification Reporting Act. NOAA keeps track of the reports submitted, and maintains them for public access in the NOAA Library. NOAA is one of the lead federal research agencies investigating the Earth system, including the planet’s radiative balance, the global carbon cycle, and the chemistry and composition of the atmosphere. NOAA conducts observations and modeling research on the climate system and the detailed atmospheric and oceanic processes that drive it. Researching how SRM may change the climate system is part of NOAA’s mission. NOAA observations provide important constraints on and verification of NOAA modeling and projection capabilities, which, in turn, enable the exploration of future climate scenarios that allow for examining and understanding impacts, options, and tradeoffs.

This included very dry conditions in the West, which helped to set the stage for the devastating wildfires that occurred around Los Angeles. As we head into the last month of meteorological winter, will winter retain its icy grip across large parts of the nation or will milder weather return? And after another dry month, will rain (and snow) become more prevalent across the country? Here’s what NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) predicts for February.

With timescales ranging from weeks to years, the outlooks help promote effective management of climate risk and form a climate-resilient society. The video below provides a virtual tour of the Climate Prediction Center’s outlook tools. (3 minutes, 6 seconds). Climate.gov's Ned Gardiner does a show and tell about how climate outlooks for temperature and precipitation are different from weather forecasts. Video by Ned Gardiner, Kurt Mann, Alicia Albee, and Bruce Sales. The tools from the Climate Prediction Center, a branch of the National Weather Service, allow users to view color-coded maps of categories of forecast conditions for their region relative to their average norms. The maps are available as either extended-range (6 to 10 days and 8 to 14 days) or long-range (1- and 3-month periods) forecasts. The latter predictions are available for up to one year in the future. For extended-range forecast maps, red and blue areas show regions that are favored to experience above (red) or below (blue) normal five- or seven-day mean temperatures. Greens and browns show areas that are favored to see above (green) or below (brown) average 5- or 7-day total precipitation. Areas in white show places where 5- or 7-day mean temperature or total precipitation are favored to be near average. On the long-range outlooks, white means something slightly different: white indicates equal odds for above, near or below average 1- or 3-month mean temperature or total precipitation. On each map, outlines around areas of color indicate the probabilities for above- or below-average conditions with darker colors indicating a higher likelihood for the forecast category. These forecasts can help decision makers such as water managers improve productivity and reduce potential risk that could threaten the livelihoods and health of the people in their regions.

    "content": "The towering smokestacks of Taichung Power Station, Taiwan—the world's largest coal-fired power plant. Photo from Wikimedia Commons. Scientists say that doubling pre-industrial carbon dioxide levels will likely cause global average surface temperature to rise between 1.5° and 4.5° Celsius (2.7° to 8.1° Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial temperatures. (Current concentrations are about 1.4 times pre-industrial levels.) The full process could take hundreds of years—perhaps more than a thousand—to play out. Climate scientists call the full temperature rise from doubled carbon dioxide concentrations the equilibrium climate sensitivity. To understand how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide on time frames of a century or less, scientists also study the transient climate sensitivity. They imagine that carbon dioxide will continue to increase at roughly the rate it has been, and then ask how much warming would be realized around the time when the concentration has doubled the preindustrial value. On this shorter time scale, it’s likely the planet will warm between 1° and 2.5°C (2°-4.5°F). The difference between transient and equilibrium sensitivity comes from the fact that some parts of the Earth system—mountain glaciers, sea ice, precipitation—react within years or a few decades to a warming or cooling nudge. Others—including ice sheets, permafrost, and especially the deep ocean—respond sluggishly, sometimes taking centuries to overcome the inertia of their previous state. Estimates of climate sensitivity are not the same thing as model predictions of future temperatures. Sensitivity is a way to try to describe how the Earth system is capable of reacting if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were to double, not a prediction of if or when that might happen. Future temperatures depend, obviously, on how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide and how much we actually emit. Preliminary data for",

If you’ve ever taken a trip to the Lake Erie shore, you’ve probably seen them: signs at many roadside restaurants and diners, announcing “yellow perch dinner specials” – generally a variation on “fried, broiled, or Cajun style,” with or without a sandwich bun. The tasty fish is a Lake Erie staple and many businesses along the shoreline rely on yellow perch for a large part of their income. But as climate changes in the region, this popular fish species–which some consider the ultimate pan-fried fish–may become much less common, potentially forcing consumers to adopt new traditions. Dr. Stuart Ludsin, Associate Professor in The Ohio State University’s Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology, is studying the potential impacts of climate change on fish in the Great Lakes, focusing particularly on two predicted impacts: warming temperatures and an increase in extreme precipitation events. Yellow perch adults average 4-10 inches, weigh 4-10 ounces, and prefer water temperatures 66-70°F, although they remain active all winter beneath Great Lakes ice cover.

The video below provides an overview of the International Desk and describes how professional meteorologists from around the globe come to NOAA to learn to use a new set of tools they can take home to help make their regions climate smart. (3 min, 3 seconds) NOAA's International Desk trains professional meteorologists from around the globe to use a set of forecasting tools they can take back to their home countries. The goal of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s International Desks is to prepare an international cadre of meteorologists to face the challenges of a modern weather and climate forecast office. Working in partnership with the World Meteorological Organization and the National Meteorological and Hydrologic Services, the NOAA-sponsored training program helps meteorologists from Africa, Asia, and Central America apply the techniques and products NOAA has developed. Armed with their own practical experience and detailed understanding of weather forecasting in their own country, these scientists participate in a training program with three main components: an in-residence training in an operational environment, training via workshops, and follow-up training through distance learning. The four desks—the African Desk, the South American Desk, the Tropical Desk, and the Monsoon Desk—train more than 20 visiting meteorologists each year in the residence program. The training program offers these scientists a better understanding of the major climate factors that influence climate variability in their respective countries. Every meteorologist who completes the program can help their own community gain critical lead time to prepare for weather influenced by the climate system.

Knowing how to access and analyze the wide variety of datasets needed to study extreme weather & climate events can be a challenge. This video explains how NOAA's \"Weather and Climate Toolkit\" makes it easier for those who want to sift through and visualize gigabytes of weather and climate data. Weather affects everything and everyone. Extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, floods, and hurricanes add an extra layer of complexity for those trying to examine weather data because they can require separate data files for each time slice of the events. These data files can easily number from the hundreds to well over a thousand. The Weather and Climate Toolkit offers access to traditionally hard-to-use weather data in an accessible, visual format. If you’re someone with NOAA data but don’t know how to process it into something usable, the Weather and Climate Toolkit is a great first step to getting that data into a workable format. Likewise, if you have NOAA data and want to get it into a format you’re already familiar with, the toolkit quickly allows you to do that. The tool will allow you to get a deeper look at extreme weather events and get a better idea of the bigger climate picture without having to invest in additional software. Launch the toolkit by either downloading the software or running it directly through the web at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/ and clicking on the “Download/Launch” button halfway down the page. The toolkit homepage also offers access to data, image galleries, user guides, and tutorials by navigating links via the blue box on the left-hand side of the page.

To climate scientists, those relics tell a story about how our planet's climate and atmosphere have changed over thousands of years. The embedded pebbles and dingy ice tell researchers that this portion of the ice core is from the bottom of the glacier, right above bedrock. This chunk comes from the first ice core drilled at Mt. Hunter, Alaska; the core's total length was 682 feet. Photo by Mike Waszkiewicz. What they find out could have an impact on worldwide civilization within a few generations—especially in coastal regions. Ice cores may reveal whether Antarctica's western ice sheet melted fully the last time Earth's climate warmed to the temperatures the planet is predicted to reach in the next two centuries. If it did, it's likely to again, which would raise sea levels significantly enough to threaten many seaside cities. \"We have some evidence that may have happened, but we aren't sure,\" says Erich Osterberg, who studies ice cores as an assistant professor in the Department of Earth Science at Dartmouth College. To unlock the information inside an ice core, researchers in the lab may melt or crush the sample bit by bit; each deeper layer represents a slightly earlier time in the Earth's climate history. The ice arrives in small strips, about 1-by-1 inch apiece, which are smaller slices of the roughly three-foot-long, coffee-can-wide pieces a drill pulls out of a glacier. Light and dark bands alternate like tree rings in this ice core from the summit of Greenland. Multiple pairs of gloves are required to handle the core. Photo by Erich Osterberg. Sometimes researchers are studying actual bubbles of the early atmosphere, trapped in the ice as it formed. To collect them, they crush the sample under a vacuum hood, which keeps other air out while they pull the newly released air into vials. Scientists run melted samples through various instruments—mass spectrometers, scanning electron microscopes, gas chromatographs—to find tiny pieces of pollution, like sulfates, traces of metals, or radioactive fallout, or natural aerosols like dust or volcanic ash. An ice core rests in a melter designed by Erich Osterberg's team. The melter enables the team to detect traces of pollution, sea salt, dust, volcanic ash, forest fire soot, and other inclusions. Photo by Erich Osterberg. Because every clue in the ice, whether a grain of sea salt or an air bubble, is so miniscule and the measurements must be incredibly precise, any analysis must be done in a \"clean room\" setting. The researchers wear body suits and multiple layers of gloves; the room must have ultraclean filters and vents to keep the air pristine. \"Even just a fingerprint from a scientist holding the core can ruin the sample,\" Osterberg says. After analyzing enough ice core slices, which may each represent anywhere from a week to a year of time, a researcher can look for patterns to track changes in the atmosphere's composition and temperature, and what activity on Earth shaped it. The ratio of \"light\" oxygen-16 to \"heavy\" oxygen-18 in a sample, for instance, reveals the global temperature when the ice formed; it takes colder temperatures for water vapor containing the lighter oxygen isotope to turn into precipitation. Examining the gasses trapped in ice cores is how scientists first learned that the amount of carbon dioxide and the global temperature have been linked at least the last million years of Earth's history. Osterberg even thinks ice cores will help figure out whether Antarctica's western ice sheet melted 125,000 years ago, the last time Earth's climate warmed to the temperatures the planet is predicted to reach in the next two centuries. Scientists hope to collect a new ice core from the eastern side of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains, which today separate the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets. Much of the land under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is below sea level. If the ice sheet did disintegrate, then the proposed ice core drilling location—presently in the middle of the frozen continent—would have been coastal real estate 125,000 years ago. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet includes two massive ice shelves that extend over the Southern Ocean. If the ice west of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains melted completely 125,000 years ago, ice that today is hundreds of miles inland would have been close to sea. The right-hand part of the image is a close-up of the area around Berkner Island. Image by the NASA/GSFC Scientific Visualization Studio, based on Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica data. \"We would see much warmer temperatures and higher levels of sea salt reflected in the ice core chemistry if this location was hundreds of miles closer to the ocean in the past,\" Osterberg said. Before the climate fossils can tell their stories, however, they must be retrieved. Rugged researchers like Osterberg and his colleagues may spend multiple summers scoping never-before-explored areas on glaciers before trekking out to collect a core. To pick the spot, they check the ice's thickness and layers (the flatter the better) and put out GPS markers to track how quickly the ice is flowing and deforming (the slower the better). Setting up base camp and drilling into the ice may take six to eight weeks for two cores that are each 700 feet long, Osterberg says. Some researchers, particularly in Antarctica, may drill two miles and take much longer.

    "content": "Between burning fossil fuels and clearing forests, humans emit far more carbon dioxide than Earth’s natural physical and biological processes can remove from the atmosphere. Fundamental to any attempts to understand, slow, or reverse the build up of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a global accounting of where it’s released and stored. That’s why scientists at NOAA’s Earth Systems Research Laboratory created CarbonTracker: a carbon dioxide measuring and modeling system that tracks sources and sinks around the globe. The video below provides a virtual tour of CarbonTracker, highlights results from recent analyses, and explains the importance of long-term CO2 monitoring. When it comes to carbon dioxide’s influence on Earth’s surface temperature, the only thing that really matters is the bottom line: how much there is in the atmosphere. But when it comes to understanding how natural processes and human activities influence that bottom line, everything matters: where and when the carbon is released, where and when it’s sequestered, how weather and climate and human decisions influence surface carbon fluxes. Those details are critical not only for predicting future climate change, but also for understanding how agricultural and ecological systems will respond to rising carbon dioxide concentrations. Being able to say with confidence where and how much carbon dioxide is stored and released by different landscapes and activities will also be a prerequisite for evaluating carbon mitigation strategies. CarbonTracker is a data assimilation system that combines observed carbon dioxide concentrations from 81 sites around the world with model predictions of what concentrations would be based on a preliminary set of assumptions (“the first guess”) about sources and sinks for carbon dioxide. CarbonTracker compares the model predictions with reality and then systematically tweaks and evaluates the preliminary assumptions until it finds the combination that best matches the real world data. The CarbonTracker has modules for atmospheric transport of carbon dioxide via weather systems, for photosynthesis and respiration, for air-sea exchange, and of course, for fossil fuel combustion and fires. Users can download the source code, the measurements of carbon dioxide that feed the assimilation, and the surface carbon flux estimates that CarbonTracker produces to conduct their own analyses or to contribute to the further improvement of the software.

    "content": "Located more than 2,000 miles from the continental United States, Hawaii faces a unique set of sustainability challenges that will become more complex as the climate changes. Jacqueline Kozak Thiel, Hawaii’s State Sustainability Coordinator, has been an active advisor to Governor Neil Abercrombie in his efforts as a member of President Obama’s State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. Jacqueline Kozak Thiel, Hawaii's State Sustainability Coordinator. To prepare for their work with the Task Force, Kozak Thiel and Abercrombie worked with the Pacific Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program; NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service; the National Climatic Data Center; and the Pacific Island Climate Change Cooperative to develop Navigating Change—a report that examines climate change impacts in Hawaii and assesses the adaptive capacity of Pacific Island communities. Q: As one of the most geographically isolated islands on the planet, Hawaii is especially vulnerable to climate change. Is there any one issue that you're most concerned with? Hawaii is actually the most geographically isolated island chain on the planet, and the interacting impacts of climate change are really evident here. I am most concerned with how those interactions will impact our most vulnerable populations—both human and natural communities, which are deeply interconnected in Hawaii. We’re so fortunate here in Hawaii that we don’t have any mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria, West Nile, or Dengue fever. But those are climate-sensitive diseases that are projected to proliferate, so I have great concerns about that because of how much it’s tied to community health. The advent of mosquito-borne illnesses in Hawaii would forever change the way of life here and significantly impact our tourism-based economy. Already, we have so many sustainability challenges as a state, and I am concerned about how climate change will exacerbate these issues. Especially in terms of food and energy security—we import 80 to 90 percent of our food and energy in Hawaii. We’re currently trying to increase our food self-sufficiency so that we are more resilient, but at the same time we’re faced with a higher likelihood of drought due to climate change. Both the impacts of trying to figure out how to protect our critical infrastructure along the coastlines from erosion and sea level rise, and also preserving biodiversity in a changing climate. So my 'biggest concern' isn’t just one thing, it’s the interaction of all these different impacts on an archipelago that’s already vulnerable. Q: Tourism is a substantial part of Hawaii's economy. In what ways might climate change transform a tourist's experience in the future? Seventy percent of our beaches are currently eroding. There are beaches where I used to run that are no longer wide enough to run on any more. The National Climate Assessment projected impacts of more than $2 billion for Hawaii’s Waikiki Beach. The world-renowned places that people come here to enjoy are disappearing. People come to Hawaii to have authentic natural experiences. They come to hear birds that are endemic to this place and found nowhere else in the world. But those birds are going to face an increasing threat of avian malaria as mosquitoes continue to move to higher and higher elevations due to temperature changes. We’re losing those safe havens for our native birds. We already have serious issues with invasive species, like little fire ants on beaches. These changes already are significantly impacting the visitor experience (and will continue to), as well as life for our residents. Nearly all the worldwide habitat for the Laysan albatross is found on the low, sandy islands of northwestern Hawaii. Like many of Hawaii's endemic birds, the species is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise.

Q: While Hawaii has a unique perspective as the country's only island state, do you have any advice for other states starting to plan for their sustainability efforts and climate change? As an island state, Hawaii is a microcosm of the climate change issues and sustainability challenges facing the planet. Hawaii and other islands are like windows into the future. The Pacific islands are on the front lines of climate change, and we’re seeing things more quickly. We’re small landmasses, and the feedback loops between the environment and society are quicker. Because of this, Hawaii can be a closed system, a testbed for innovation, and a model for how we deal with a lot of the challenges that are happening on the mainland and across the planet. And so the challenges that we’re facing are of great interest not only to folks in the U.S., but around the world. If we’re grappling with them and figuring out the solutions, those solutions can be utilized in other places. We are already in the top of the nation in terms of renewable energy penetration into the grid. Hawaii is a really great lens to look at how mitigation and adaptation to climate change can go hand in hand—it’s a place to discover how we’re going to deal with these challenges and share that information out. Q: Climate change is considered by many to be an issue to tackle in the future. What is Hawaii's state leadership doing in the immediate to prepare for the impacts of climate change? Water, as we know, is going to be the most important currency of the century. I think one of the most exciting things we’ve been doing as a state is called the Rain Follows the Forest Watershed Initiative. It really recognizes, as islands, our source of water comes from healthy, biodiverse, native ecosystems in the watersheds. The Initiative approaches watershed management as a proactive way to make sure that our ecosystems are resilient and that we’re doing everything we can to deliver higher quality and quantity of water through that ecosystem-based adaptation. We’re also the endangered species capital of the U.S. So, by protecting our native forests, we’re simultaneously addressing a lot of different things to make our natural environment more resilient while also protecting our source of water. This is important because we know that one of the largest impacts of climate change is going to be a reduction in fresh water for our communities. Our state government just signed into law the Hawaii Climate Adaptation Initiative, which puts in place an interagency climate committee for Hawaii. The impacts and interactions of climate change fall under the jurisdiction of many different agencies. The Departments of Transportation, Health, Agriculture, and Land and Natural Resources, as well as Business, Economic Development, and Tourism and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, need to come together to work on collaborative solutions. The committee also invites people from the University of Hawaii, nonprofits, and federal agencies and the counties to participate. The Initiative has the resources to begin implementing the state’s Climate Change Adaptation Priority Guidelines (Act 286). We’re starting with sea level rise as the foundational framework. By",

Photo courtesy the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Florida morning was cool and damp; raindrops from a predawn shower shone on the strawberry leaves like little cabochon diamonds. Dudley Calfee, surveying his strawberry crop, knew that if the weather warmed up before the raindrops dried fruit rot could get a hold and, instead of gleaming red berries to bring to market, he would have a moldy grey fuzz of a disaster on his hands. The subtropical climate of Florida makes growing strawberries a constant battle against at least two kinds of fruit rot: Anthracnose and Botrytis. Traditionally, Florida strawberry farmers have sprayed fungicide to prevent rot. They sprayed every week or ten days throughout the growing season, just in case rot was even thinking of appearing. The costs of spraying—including fungicides, equipment, and personnel—cut into profits, and also gave Florida strawberries a reputation that doesn’t square with customers’ demand for more natural berries. Strawberry farmers in Florida fight against fruit rot, two of the most common forms being Anthracnose (left) and Botrytis (right). Photo courtesy the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Calfee himself used to be a spray-every-week farmer. Then one day he got a call from Natalia Peres, a plant disease scientist with the Gulf Coast Research and Education Center at the University of Florida. Funded by the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Peres and her team were researching strawberry disease, and they were wondering if Calfee would be willing to be a guinea pig. They wanted to test a system to allow growers to raise strawberries with less fungicide. The system they had developed used an algorithm to process temperature data, leaf wetness readings, humidity, and the local weather forecast together to tell if conditions would be favorable for fruit rot fungus to grow. Using the algorithm, their system would predict whether spraying with fungicide was necessary. Peres and her team proposed to tell Calfee when to spray fungicide and when to hold off. She asked him to promise not to spray unless they said so. If the system was successful he could cut fungicide sprays by 50 percent while keeping berry yields the same, Peres predicted. If she was right, Calfee would save both time and money and end up with a strawberry yield as good as if he had sprayed every week. Farmer Dudley Calfee and Dr. Natalia Peres, a plant diseases scientist with the University of Florida’s Gulf Coast Research and Education Center, check sensors on the farm. These sensors process temperature data, leaf wetness readings, humidity, and local weather forecasts. Photo courtesy the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Calfee was skeptical. In fact, there was no way he would trust his berry crop to some scientist. On the other hand, he wanted to find out if she was right. So he agreed to run Peres’ test on a quarter-acre plot—just nine strawberry beds for one season. He agreed to spray that one area only when told. To be safe, Calfee carefully placed his test plot where it wouldn’t contaminate the rest of the crop if it went to rot. The first year Calfee was pretty impressed. The test plot grew no more Anthracnose and Botrytis fungus than the rest of his crop, though he sprayed it about 30% less than the surrounding fields. Still, he remained skeptical. Perhaps the test plot was protected by the 82 regularly sprayed acres of berries around it. The next year he agreed to quadruple the test area to an acre. Again the results were the same on the science-advised plot as on the fields he sprayed weekly. Sometimes a bit of the fungus would start to show, but if the weather was too cool or dry for it to thrive, it would clear up on its own. A hazy morning in a central Floridian field. The high humidity associated with central Florida’s subtropical climate means that farmers constantly battle against fruit rot. Photo courtesy Traveling Crab Photography. The third year, Calfee managed five of his 83 acres by following the Strawberry Advisory System, informed by Peres and her team. The system worked! By the fifth year, Peres had to convince Calfee to keep spraying one quarter-acre test plot weekly as a control in their experiment. He only sprayed the rest of his 83 acres when the science team sent him an alert. “We believed it after we watched it with our own eyes,” he said. Florida farmers grow about 11,000 acres of strawberries. Peres’ team estimates that spraying only when needed, and spraying the best product for the problem, can save up to $400 per acre per year. If all growers in Central Florida used the system for their 7,500 acres of winter strawberries, they could reduce their costs by up to $3 million per year. A farmer sprays a strawberry field with pesticides. Photo courtesy Mark Bolda, University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Calfee says that, in addition to saving money, he appreciates that he can now say he grows strawberries that are as close to organic as possible in Florida—a claim he knows his customers appreciate. There was quite a bit of reluctance among neighboring farmers at first, but after five years word spread about the success of the system. Just over half of strawberry growers in Florida have adopted the Strawberry Advisory System in its first decade of existence, reducing their use of fungicides by 30-50%. That’s a good adoption rate, notes Peres, adding that less spraying also helps the fungus avoid developing resistance to the chemicals. That damp fall morning, another farmer might have called in his sprayers, but Calfee chose to trust in science. He checked his phone. No alerts from the Strawberry Advisory System; the weather was expected to stay too cool for fruit rot to thrive. These days, he is confident that if the Advisory System doesn’t send an alert, his strawberries will be safe without spraying.

Bartel works with farmers in the Southeast who are interested in switching from conventional crop rotation to sod-based crop rotation. One of his key tools is the Water Footprint Calculator, an online tool that allows him to estimate the water savings of sod-based crop rotation. Ron Bartel, senior hydrologist at the University of Florida's North Florida Research Education Center, stands with farming irrigation equipment. Photo courtesy Ana Bartel. Q: Let’s start with the basics. What is a sod-based crop rotation? Sod-based crop rotation is adding a perennial grass to a conventional crop rotation. In the Southeast, a conventional crop rotation is two years of cotton, then peanuts, and then you start all over again. In a sod-based rotation, a perennial grass is grown for two years on a portion of the field in place of cotton. We’ve been successfully experimenting with Bahia grass. After two growing seasons, the grass field is replanted in peanuts followed by cotton a year later. This increases yields and basically allows for a lot more resilience. If you add cattle to the equation, it’s extremely profitable because they’re using the Bahia grass and recycling the nutrients. That’s grass-fed beef, which is really profitable! Q: What did you mean when you said this sort of rotation adds resilience? I like to tell people “it’s all about the roots.” The sod-based rotation research that we’re doing basically shows that you don’t need to irrigate to get the same yield. In conventionally rotated crops, particularly in the Southeast, there’s a compaction layer in the soil that’s anywhere from 6 to 18 inches. What that does is prevent the roots from going down to get more water at the deeper depths. Because the roots can’t grow deeper than this compaction layer, you need irrigation water to keep the plants alive. When the root growth is stunted, they don’t get any more water from the ground and that’s why they often need supplemental irrigation. With a sod-based rotation, the sod growing for two years is able to penetrate that compaction layer. Basically, the roots of the sod are strong, and they go through the compaction layer and create little channels, and then when the peanuts and cotton are planted, their roots follow the channels. The roots are denser and get to the deeper soil horizons where there’s much more moisture. Sometimes, it could be as much as 3 times the root depth as the conventional rotating crop is. It can be even deeper than that in sandier soils. So the crops being grown are much more resilient to drought. And because you’re using less water, you’re using less fuel to pump that water, so there’s less energy costs. It goes beyond resiliency; it’s a sustainable practice. Q: You use the Water Footprint Tool in your work. Can you explain a bit about how it works and how farmers can use its information to save water? We used the Water Footprint Tool to compare the conventional and sod-based rotations. We simulated a shallow-rooted crop to represent the conventional rotation and then a deep-rooted crop to represent the sod-based rotation. The simulations showed a dramatic difference. In the sod-based rotation, the crops hardly ever need watering. Anyone can use the footprint tool. It is available online. From a drop down menu, you pick one of three different soil types, the crop type, and whether the crop is shallow or deep-rooted. What the model shows—and this agrees with our field data—is that for cotton and peanuts no irrigation water is needed for the deep rooted crops in most years. Besides soil types, the other thing we looked into was the range of weather conditions. We looked at several rain gauges—actual weather stations in Georgia and Florida—to see how much variability there is. We did a lot of runs with the Water Footprint Tool. We didn’t just do one or two runs: for each of nine weather stations, we performed 18 simulations, each representing a soil and crop type for a 34-year period. That’s a lot of data! And all that data gives us a good idea—based on the climatology in the Southeast and common soil types—just what the range in water savings potential is. Q: And what sort of water savings did you find? Because we were able to generate data for 34 years, we are able to forecast the irrigation water savings depending upon the intensity of drought. The surprising part was that the sod-based rotation has a greater water savings potential the greater the drought. Depending on soil type, it ranges from 9 inches to 14 inches of irrigation water savings during a moderate drought. That’s essentially a foot of water spread over the million acres being irrigated for cotton and peanuts in the Southeast. So that’s a lot of water. A sod-based rotation can work anywhere in the country (or globally) that will grow a perennial grass, and that doesn’t necessarily need to be Bahia grass. Q: Is water savings the only benefit of the sod-based crop rotation? Reduced fuel costs, reduced energy consumption, increased profits, reduced fertilizer and pesticide use are some of the other benefits reported. The buildup of organic matter in the soil by the grass roots improves soil health and crop yields. Studies at the University of Florida are also looking the benefits of the system for net carbon burial of the system – a global climate change initiative! As I mentioned earlier, sod-based rotation is much more resilient to drought conditions. Just recently, in",

    "date": null,
    "content": "Laura Sager is the Executive Director of the Soil and Water Conservation District in Columbia County, New York. Among a range of important topics that occupy her days, Sager spends an increasing amount of time on a topic that many people consider mundane: she’s thinking about culverts. Culvert on Lake Creek in Rensselaerville, NY. Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons. Culverts—simple tubes or tunnels that channel water beneath roads, railroads, and trails—are a hallmark of the developed world. Wherever humans can engineer relatively small amounts of water to flow through a tube beneath a roadway, the road is smoother and travel speeds along it are higher. Culverts serve as miniature bridges, keeping roadways high and dry, just above flowing water that could erode them away. The reason culverts are commanding Sager’s attention is rain. Across the contiguous United States, and especially in the Northeast, the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events has increased significantly over the last century. During heavy rains, huge volumes of water fill drainage systems quickly, and can overwhelm installed culverts. When a culvert cannot convey the amount of water attempting to flow through it, water typically backs up on the upstream side, causing localized flooding. The accumulated water may overflow across the roadway, disrupting transportation and increasing erosion that can wash out the culvert. Sediment and debris from an upstream failure may cause additional failures downstream, flooding other roads, houses, and cropland. Even small-scale flooding at undersized culverts can degrade water quality, erode stream banks, block access to habitat for aquatic organisms, and damage private and municipal property. Culvert washout at Walker Brook in Becket, Massachusetts. Photo courtesy Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration. To avoid these issues and keep drainage systems functioning, Sager needs to identify the culverts in her district that are too small for the volume of water that may come their way. With hundreds of culverts of varying size and purpose across the county, she also needs data that can help her identify the most important culverts for replacement. Climate records are a key resource engineers use to select appropriate diameters for culverts in various locations. Culverts shouldn’t be too small, as the frequent flooding that would result leads to societal disruptions and environmental damage. Culverts shouldn’t be too large either, as their cost would inflate the price to complete projects. Culvert washout in Liberty, NY. Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons. Statistical analyses of extreme rainfall data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily database can be helpful for calculating appropriate diameters for culverts. These analyses, available through NOAA Atlas 14, provide estimates for the recurrence interval of extreme rainfall amounts. For instance, the Atlas reports that in Rhinebeck, NY, an 8-inch rainstorm can be expected to occur once every 100 years, while storms that produce at least 7 inches of rain are twice as likely. With this information, Sager can assess the climatological risk of particular culverts failing in any given year, and weigh the economic, societal, and environmental costs against the benefits of installing new culverts. Unfortunately, the observed increase in frequency of extreme precipitation events shows that the past is no longer an adequate guide for the future. Culverts that were of an adequate size when they were installed decades ago are now prone to flooding and failure. Sager faces a dilemma: should she rely on the historical data which may not reflect conditions 10, 20, or 50 years into the future, or should she install larger culverts—oversized by current standards—that will be adequate to accommodate future rainfall extremes? Work conducted by NOAA’s Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University, with funding through NOAA’s Sectoral Applications Research Program, is providing Sager and her colleagues with several additional resources to help solve this quandary. Annually updated extreme rainfall analyses collected as part of the Extreme Precipitation in a Changing Climate project provide a perspective as to how quickly values describing a 100-year storm are changing. Similarly, global climate model projections for future extreme rainfall also provide indications of how the current trend may continue in the future. Finally, online tools based on hydrological models that account for land use and topography can inform users about the volume of runoff expected under different conditions.

    "content": "Running from the Appalachian Mountains to the Florida Everglades, the southeastern United States produces a vast array of agricultural goods including citrus, strawberries, corn, cotton, soybean, and peanuts. To effectively bring these crops—and many other agriculture goods—to market, growers need to track a variety of weather and climate conditions from week to week and season to season. To help meet that need the NOAA-sponsored Southeast Climate Consortium provides AgroClimate: an online suite of tools to help growers manage their climate risks. The video below provides a virtual tour of ArgoClimate.org, focusing on two of the site’s popular tools: the Strawberry Advisory System and Regional Yield Maps. (3 minutes, 12 seconds) Climate.gov's Ned Gardiner gives a tour of the tools and resources available for those in the agriculture industry in the Southeast. Produced by Ned Gardiner, Kurt Mann, Alicia Albee, and Bruce Sales. AgroClimate.org is portal containing an open-source suite of tools and resources specifically tailored to farmers and ranchers in the southeastern United States. The website includes tools to help growers plan for certain types of crop disease, crop yields, climate and drought risks, growing degree days, greenhouse gas emissions, and water usage. AgroClimate.org provides climate data and forecasts that can help growers boost yields, avoid disease, and fend off pests. Its mobile apps are designed to help you access these tools whenever you need them. One of AgroClimate’s most popular tools—the Strawberry Alert System (SAS)—integrates expert assessments with weather station observations from a grower’s own property. By combining this information, the Strawberry Alert System displays property-specific warnings about potential fruit rot outbreaks and offers recommended management practices to combat these crop-ruining diseases. After seasons of using this tool, scientists at the Southeast Climate Consortium found that farmers can reduce fungicide applications by half by following the SAS-recommended practices—resulting in a savings of up to $400/acre. The AgroClimate portal is online at www.AgroClimate.org. There, you can learn more about managing climate risks in the southeastern United States. The navigation bar offers direct access to a whole suite of open-source tools, climate and weather forecasts, state climate reports, and management fact sheets. The navigation bar also links to upcoming extension events, informational videos, climate fact sheets, and an “About AgroClimate” page, which offers further information about the website. The AgroClimate project is moving from an HTML-based mobile website to downloadable apps for monitoring weather and crop conditions, plant diseases, and irrigation scheduling.

Said another way, global warming is one symptom of the much larger problem of human-caused climate change. Global warming is just one symptom of the much larger problem of climate change.  cartoon by Emily Greenhalgh. Another distinction between global warming and climate change is that when scientists or public leaders talk about global warming these days, they almost always mean human-caused warming—warming due to the rapid increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from people burning coal, oil, and gas. Climate change, on the other hand, can mean human-caused changes or natural ones, such as ice ages. Besides burning fossil fuels, humans can cause climate changes by emitting aerosol pollution—the tiny particles that reflect sunlight and cool the climate— into the atmosphere, or by transforming the Earth's landscape, for instance, from carbon-storing forests to farmland. The planet has experienced climate change before: the Earth’s average temperature has fluctuated throughout the planet’s 4.54 billion-year history. The planet has experienced long cold periods (\"ice ages\") and warm periods (\"interglacials\") on 100,000-year cycles for at least the last million years. Previous warming episodes were triggered by small increases in how much sunlight reached Earth’s surface and then amplified by large releases of carbon dioxide from the oceans as they warmed (like the fizz escaping from a warm soda). Increases and decreases in global temperature during the naturally occurring ice ages of the past 800,000 years, ending with the early twentieth century.  graph by Fiona Martin, based on EPICA Dome C ice core data provided by the Paleoclimatology Program at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Today’s global warming is overwhelmingly due to the increase in heat-trapping gases that humans are adding to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. In fact, over the last five decades, natural factors (solar forcing and volcanoes) would actually have led to a slight cooling of Earth’s surface temperature. Global warming is also different from past warming in its rate. The current increase in global average temperature appears to be occurring much faster than at any point since modern civilization and agriculture developed in the past 11,000 years or so—and probably faster than any interglacial warm periods over the last million years.

    "content": "Chicago is at the center of one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States: around 10 million residents live in the region, in neighborhoods that range from high-density housing to suburbs with yards and open space between single-family homes. Trees in yards and parks across the region provide some shade when temperatures rise, but the region's tree canopy—the percentage of the ground covered by tree branches and leaves—is lower than in many other cities in the Midwest. The loss of 13 million ash trees to an invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, has further reduced the canopy in many areas. The cost of removing and replacing ash trees has exhausted many municipal budgets in the region, leaving little money to care for the remaining trees or time to plan ahead. The Chicago region is already experiencing temperature increases, more heavy rain events, and local flooding that can all place further stress on urban trees. These impacts are expected to become even more pronounced in the years to come. Faced with the decline of urban trees, concerned groups joined together to form the Chicago Region Trees Initiative. Their goals were to improve management skills and knowledge, increase the region’s tree canopy, and incorporate species that are resistant to pests and the impacts of climate change. Resilient cities draw strength from their green spaces. Urban green space helps to cool cities during the summer, control storm water, and capture air pollutants. Green space can reduce stress and neighborhood crime, and it provides places for neighbors to forge strong connections. Healthy and empowered communities are better equipped to deal with change in a positive way. Those benefits motivated the Chicago Region Trees Initiative to partner with Leslie Brandt, a climate change specialist with the Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science and the U.S. Forest Service, to confront the decline in urban trees. Their goal was to assess the vulnerability of the region’s trees to climate change and other factors, and then move on to consider strategies for adaptation. The partners used habitat suitability modeling, projected changes in heat and hardiness zones, and an assessment of tree species' adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of more than 150 tree species that are currently growing or recommended for planting in the region. The assessment showed that some of the least vulnerable trees in the region are non-native invasive species. Conversely, results indicated that many of the species native to the area are vulnerable to changing conditions. After losing many of its ash trees, the Village of Riverside in Chicago replaced some of them with resilient species such as buckeye and pecan. Image Credit: Michael Collins, Village of Riverside. Used with permission. Representatives from counties, municipalities, and park districts worked with experts in climate change adaptation in a series of workshops on urban forest vulnerability and adaptation. Using a structured process, they evaluated which impacts and adaptive-capacity factors had the largest effects on vulnerability. Finally, they implemented a five-step adaptation project to incorporate climate change considerations into real-world projects and planning efforts, which included planting resilient trees. The Chicago Region Trees Initiative is integrating climate change-related goals into a regional tree master plan and updating its recommended planting list to encourage climate-adapted species. Members of the Chicago Regional Trees Initiative teach proper planting and tree care for communities that may not have a trained forester or arborist on staff.

Communities across the Chicago region are working to incorporate vulnerability information and adaptation strategies in their work. Looking to the future, the initiative is seeking grant funding they will use to create real-world demonstrations of adaptation that resulted from the workshops.

Public health officials, however, remain on high alert during the warm days: they are increasingly aware of the increased exposure to extreme heat that accompanies summertime activities and the threats faced by residents of buildings without air conditioning. They're also mindful of the need for extra protection of vulnerable populations during heat waves. Health officials in Minnesota have made it easy for communities of all sizes to implement a heat health plan. Check out how they are Building Resilience Against Climate Effects. U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit video. Building resilience to extreme heat for the range of rural, urban, economically disadvantaged, and wealthy communities across an entire state presents a formidable challenge. While Minnesota is a state that is more commonly known for its frigid winters than its warm summers, it has occasionally experienced summer heat waves that linger for several days. In response, cities and towns across the state have taken strides to meet the challenge of protecting their residents when heat waves occur. Building on lessons learned over several summers, Kristin Raab—Health Impact Assessment and Climate Change Program Director in the Environmental Health Division of Minnesota’s Department of Health—packaged information from diverse communities into a cohesive toolkit that communities of all sizes can use to prepare for heat waves. The Minnesota Extreme Heat Toolkit describes changing weather conditions in Minnesota, the magnitude of potential health consequences from extreme heat, and key steps communities can take to prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths. Decision makers can identify where to focus their resilience-building efforts by identifying where relatively high numbers of vulnerable people live.This map shows the percentage of the population below the poverty line by county. The darker the color the higher the percentage. Courtesy the Minnesota Department of Health. The toolkit acknowledges that extreme heat response plans will vary with the size of the community and the habits of its residents: examples from the mostly rural Olmsted County and the urban centers of Saint Paul and Minneapolis illustrate a range of community plans that could be useful in Minnesota and beyond.

Surface moisture is really hard to measure because a major component is soil moisture, which varies dramatically over very short distances. Evaporative demand is relatively easy to measure because it’s based on air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, which we measure all the time.” Over the past few years, EDDI has steadily demonstrated its potential, accurately signaling the development of a",

Dicho de otra manera, el calentamiento global es un síntoma del mayor problema del cambio climático causado por los seres humanos. El calentamiento global es solo un síntoma del problema mucho más grande del cambio climático. Dibujo de  por Emily Greenhalgh. Otra distinción entre el calentamiento global y el cambio climático es que cuando los científicos o líderes públicos hablan sobre el calentamiento global en estos días, casi siempre se refieren al calentamiento causado por los humanos—calentamiento debido al rápido aumento del dióxido de carbono y otros gases de efecto invernadero causado por personas que queman carbón, petróleo y gas. El cambio climático, por otro lado, puede significar cambios naturales o causados por los humanos, como las edades de hielo. Además de quemar combustibles fósiles, los humanos pueden causar cambios climáticos al emitir contaminación de aerosol—las diminutas partículas que reflejan la luz solar y enfrían el clima—a la atmósfera, o al transformar el paisaje de la Tierra, por ejemplo, de bosques que almacenan carbono a tierras de cultivo. El planeta ha experimentado el cambio climático antes: la temperatura promedio de la Tierra ha fluctuado a lo largo de la historia de 4,540 millones de años del planeta. La Tierra ha experimentado períodos largos de frío (\"edades de hielo\") y períodos cálidos (\"interglaciales\") en ciclos de 100,000 de años durante al menos el último millón de años. Los episodios previos de calentamiento fueron provocados por pequeños incrementos en la cantidad de luz solar que llegaba a la superficie de la Tierra y luego amplificados por grandes emisiones de dióxido de carbono de los océanos a medida que se calentaban (como la efervescencia que escapa de una soda tibia). Aumentos y disminuciones en la temperatura global durante las edades de hielo ocurridas de forma natural en los últimos 800,000 años, terminando a principios del siglo XX.

El calentamiento global actual se debe principalmente al aumento de los gases que atrapan el calor que los humanos están agregando a la atmósfera al quemar combustibles fósiles. De hecho, en las últimas cinco décadas, los factores naturales (forzamiento solar y volcanes) en realidad habrían llevado a un ligero enfriamiento en la temperatura de la superficie de la Tierra. La tasa de aumento del calentamiento global también es diferente al calentamiento pasado.

One of the nation’s oldest cities, Richmond boasts a population of almost 225,000. Walking through this dynamic city yields a wide range of culture, landscape...and temperatures. Similar to other cities across the mid-Atlantic region, Richmond experiences generally warm and humid summer days. And like other densely populated cities, the city experiences an urban heat island effect: unshaded roads and buildings across the city gain heat through the day and radiate it to the surroundings, increasing air temperature. As a result, highly developed areas experience warmer temperatures than surrounding areas. The inset image, taken with a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera, shows heat and is overlain on a regular photograph for context. In the FLIR image, lighter or brighter colors indicate warmer areas, while darker areas are cooler. While the urban heat island effect is generally described as a city being warmer than the surrounding rural areas, heat intensity can also vary from neighborhood to neighborhood within a city. For example, dark surfaces such as asphalt absorb more heat than lighter surfaces, and built materials such as bricks and concrete absorb more heat than grass and vegetation. This means that some sections of a city will face higher temperatures on hot days than others.

Then any enjoyment you might derive from iconic spring blossoms may be overpowered by discomfort from maple, oak, or birch blooms. If pollen relentlessly tickles your nose and clogs your sinuses and itches your eyes, you end up wishing you could live somewhere north of that Westeros Wall. But the evidence suggests that, if you live farther north in the contiguous United States, your allergies won’t get better with climate change. They’ll get worse. An allergy is a reaction of your immune system to something that, for most people, is essentially harmless, such as pet dander, nuts, or pollen. For most seasonal allergy sufferers, the diagnosis is hay fever, or—as your doctor would write it down in your medical chart—allergic rhinitis. Reactions range from annoying—sneezing, itching, watery eyes, stuffy nose—to dangerous: in some people, allergies can trigger asthma attacks. Seasonal allergies afflict up to 30 percent of the world’s human population, studies have found, and the Cleveland Clinic reports a rising allergy prevalence. For most people, allergies aren’t life threatening, but they can hamper one’s enjoyment of life—for months at a stretch. Tree pollen strikes in the spring, grass pollen in the summer, and weed pollen in the summer and fall. Iconic spring blooms are not associated with allergy symptoms. Instead, allergy symptoms often arise from flowering blooms of birch, oak, and maple trees, and especially from plants in the Ambrosia genus (ragweed).

It’s harder to keep control in icy conditions and when you fall, it really hurts.” Heidi McCann, coordinator of indigenous knowledge exchange agrees, adding that the most desirable snow has low water content, and ideally, eight or more inches of fresh powder. A skier enjoys powder at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. CC license by Flickr user Zach Dischner. At an organization that collects and analyzes data on all things frozen, there’s also no shortage of skiers who are thinking about how global warming will affect conditions on their favorite slopes. Among them is NSIDC research scientist Twila Moon, who works remotely from Big Sky, Montana, and calls herself “reasonably obsessed with skiing.” She lays out the optimal conditions, which start before ski resorts open each season. “You can almost think of it as a timeline,” she explains. “Late fall into early winter is when you start to build up snowpack, when the snow layers bond together.” Hazards to skiers during this period include hoarfrost, that can form under calm, humid, clear conditions; and ice lenses caused by surface melt or rain-on-snow events. Any snow accumulating on top of these flaky or icy layers is prone to avalanche. Depth hoar, which often forms in a shallow snowpack, can result in especially widespread instability throughout much of the remaining the season, potentially leading to catastrophic avalanches. While ski resorts try to mitigate avalanche risks, backcountry and cross-country skiers outside resorts must watch out for themselves. Slope, terrain, and snowpack conditions can all contribute to avalanches. © by Richard Armstrong, NSIDC. Once ski season is well underway, Moon says, the best conditions are not too cold for skiers to endure or for snow to continue falling, “but cold enough to build up powder. Having dry spells, or warm weather, or rain on snow are very problematic.” She adds, “Of course there’s the year-to-year luck of the weather, but it’s now happening against a background trend of warming temperatures.” Moon isn’t speculating.

In a geological context, a global-scale warming of 1.8°F (1°C) in less than 150 years is an unusually large temperature change in a relatively short span of time. Over the course of the 21st century, all parts of the globe are expected to warm, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects more severe late-century changes under a higher-emissions scenario (RCP8.5) than a lower-emissions scenario (RCP2.6).

The United States' foremost scientific agencies and organizations have recognized global warming as a human-caused problem that should be addressed. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has published a series of scientific reports documenting the causes and impacts of global climate change. NOAA, NASA, the National Science Foundation, the National Research Council, and the Environmental Protection Agency have all published reports and fact sheets stating that Earth is warming mainly due to the increase in human-produced heat-trapping gases. On their climate home page, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicines says, \"Scientists have known for some time, from multiple lines of evidence, that humans are changing Earth’s climate, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions,\" and that \"Climate change is increasingly affecting people’s lives.\" Soot from fires and air pollution contributes to global warming, and its impacts may be especially strong in the Arctic, where it darkens the snow and ice—as shown in this photo—and accelerates melting. Despite some uncertainty about just how much influence soot and other aerosol particles have played in climate change in the past century, there's little debate among climate scientists that the primary driver of recent global warming is carbon dioxide emissions.

To date, climate research has yet to show that any given event was caused solely by global warming. However, over the past decade, research has demonstrated that climate change due to global warming has made many extreme events more likely, more intense, longer-lasting, or larger in scale than they would have been without it.

Over the course of these cycles, global average temperatures warmed or cooled anywhere from 3° to perhaps as much as 8° Celsius (5°-15° Fahrenheit).

This tundra flower gave its name to the Younger Dryas, a cold period that briefly interrupted the long-term warming that had begun following the peak of the last ice age glaciation around 20 thousand years ago. Climate scientists think the episode was triggered by changes in the great system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean as a result of meltwater from Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Image by P. Cikovac, used under a Creative Common license. Over at least the past million years, glacial and interglacial cycles have been triggered by variations in how much sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere in the summer, which are driven by small variations in the geometry of Earth’s axis and its orbit around the Sun. But these fluctuations in sunlight aren’t enough on their own to bring about full-blown ice ages and interglacials. They trigger several feedback loops that amplify the original warming or cooling. During an interglacial, These feedbacks amplify the initial warming until the Earth’s orbit goes through a phase during which the amount of Northern Hemisphere summer sunlight is minimized. Then these feedbacks operate in reverse, reinforcing the cooling trend. *Correction. An earlier draft mistakenly said that the last of these ice ages ended about 20 thousand years ago. The glaciation phase peaked around that time. Masson-Delmotte, V., M. Schulz, A. Abe-Ouchi, J. Beer, A. Ganopolski, J.F. González Rouco, E. Jansen, K. Lambeck, J. Luterbacher, T. Naish, T. Osborn, B.

Soot from fires and air pollution contributes to global warming, and its impacts may be especially strong in the Arctic, where it darkens the snow and ice—as shown in this photo—and accelerates melting. Despite some uncertainty about just how much influence soot and other aerosol particles have played in climate change in the past century, there's little debate among climate scientists that the primary driver of recent global warming is carbon dioxide emissions.

La Sociedad Meteorológica Americana (AMS) emitió esta declaración de posición: \"La evidencia científica indica que la principal causa del cambio climático en el último medio siglo es el aumento antropogénico de la concentración de gases de efecto invernadero en la atmósfera, incluyendo dióxido de carbono (CO2), clorofluorocarbonos, metano, ozono troposférico y óxido nitroso\".

    "content": "This article is one of a three-part series on past temperatures, including the hottest the Earth has ever been and how warm the Earth has been “lately.” For much of its history, our planet has been hotter—sometimes much hotter—than it is today. But our planet has also been colder. Scientists may never know which period in our planet’s 4.54-billion-year history was the absolute coldest, but research has revealed a few contenders. All of these periods have been identified as ancient ice ages. Some of the coldest conditions struck over 2 billion years ago, after the rise of atmospheric oxygen. More deep freezes occurred between 750 and 600 million years ago. Although scientists debate exactly how extensive the ice coverage was during these times, the evidence indicates that ice reached sea level in equatorial regions. In the past few million years, glaciers have blanketed huge expanses of the Northern Hemisphere off and on. Though less severe than the near-global glaciations, the Pleistocene ice ages may have brought the coldest conditions in the last half a billion years. Some of the worst cold struck about 20,000 years ago. The coldest place on modern Earth has been identified as a high ridge between Dome Argus and Dome Fuji in East Antarctica. Each year, scientists with the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition journey from the Antarctic coast to Dome Fuji Station.

Ice ages don’t bring unrelenting cold. Instead, relatively warm periods intervene, so ice ages are a mix of advancing glaciers (glacials) and retreating glaciers (interglacials). Though relatively warm, interglacials are still part of a glacial epoch. How do scientists know ancient ice ages happened? Clearly, thermometers weren’t handy when continental-scale glaciers advanced toward the equator. The evidence for past ice ages comes instead from geology. Soon after the scientific discipline emerged in the early 19th century, geologists began finding clues left by ancient ice bodies. Glaciers, geologists realized, could leave giant scratch marks on bedrock and carry boulders to distant landscapes, often dropping those rocks at sea. Once the signs of glaciation were recognized for the Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.6 million to 11,000 years ago), geologists knew how to recognize them in older rocks. Combining the evidence for glaciation with the evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift has enabled geologists to identify glacial activity from hundreds of millions of years ago, when continents were configured very differently. After years of explaining geologic phenomena as the result of the Noachian flood, the 19th-century British geologist William Buckland accepted the evidence for glacial action. He became a proponent of the Ice Age theory. Image credit: Wellcome Collection. Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) In all, scientists have identified upwards of a dozen ice ages in the geologic record, several of them in the last half a billion years. Some of the ice ages that struck even earlier were worse, probably the worst ice ages in our planet’s history. Among the earliest ice ages so far found in the geological record are the Huronian ice ages. At least one of them constituted what geologists call a Snowball Earth event, when the planet’s surface was entirely, or almost entirely, frozen. Interspersed with non-glacial periods, the ice ages occurred between 2.4 and 2.1 billion years ago, and probably resulted from changes in microscopic life. Paleontologists surmise that when microbial life arose on Earth over 3.5 billion years ago, microbes neither made nor needed oxygen. Instead, when life evolved, Earth’s atmosphere was very different from what we experience today. Although nitrogen levels may have been similar, other gases were much more—or much less—abundant. Carbon dioxide was anywhere from 10 to 2,500 times present levels, and methane may have been as much as 10,000 times higher than present levels. Atmospheric oxygen was virtually nonexistent. Before oxygen accumulated in Earth’s atmosphere, our planet probably looked not like a pale blue dot but instead like a pale orange dot. Image credit: NASA Astrobiology. Scientists debate when exactly microbes capable of carrying out photosynthesis and making oxygen as a byproduct first evolved. Estimates range from about 3.5 to 2.5 billion years ago. The earliest oxygen makers were probably ancestors of modern cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae. At first, the oxygen produced by these early photosynthesizers probably reacted with iron in the ocean, settling into layers of rusty sediment on the seafloor before starting to accumulate in the atmosphere. Some oxygen reacted with methane, converting it to carbon dioxide and water. Meanwhile, photosynthesizing microbe populations kept growing, consuming more carbon dioxide. Ancestors of modern cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) may have been the first oxygen producers on planet Earth, and ushered in significant changes in climate. CC license by Flickr user Richard Droker. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and methane is an even more potent greenhouse gas. As atmospheric concentrations of these greenhouse gases dropped, global temperatures plummeted, plunging the planet into a series of ice ages. The Huronian ice ages and non-glacial periods separating them likely lasted a total of 300 million years. Evidence suggests these glaciations reached equatorial regions at sea level. (Ice occurs in equatorial regions today, but only at high elevations.) Geologic evidence of these ice ages was first discovered in",

Some of these buoys float along the ocean surface, gathering data as they drift with currents (sometimes even into the paths of hurricanes!). Some, meanwhile, are moored to the ocean floor, collecting data in the same region and helping scientists observe changes over several years or decades. In honor of Ocean Month, we’re highlighting five buoys that help NOAA scientists monitor and understand the ocean (and the Great Lakes, too!).

Women’s History Month serves to honor the first women who had the courage to break into traditionally male spaces and to acknowledge those who went unrecognized for their contributions. It’s likely all of these women faced significant gender discrimination but persevered in the name of discovery. In many cases, their achievements are still not given the recognition they deserve. Below is an incomplete timeline of women in earth and climate science history over the past two centuries. Etheldred Benett is often credited as being the “First Female Geologist.” Independently wealthy and never married, Benett was an expert on fossils and stratigraphy in southwest England. She published books on her collection, supplied fossils to museums, and served as a reference for other geologists of her time. Because of her unusual first name, Benett was mistakenly granted a Doctorate of Civil Law from the University of St. Petersburg at a time when women were not admitted into higher education institutions. A sketch drawn by Etheldred Benett of a fossil sponge in her collection. Some fossils in her collection were the first to be illustrated and described; others were extremely rare or very well preserved. (The Geological Society) Mary Anning, a paleontologist and fossil collector, was the first to discover a complete skeleton of a Plesiosaurus. (The Geological Society of London convened a special meeting to discuss whether the fossil was a fake; Anning was not invited.) As a child, she assisted her father with his fossil collection. Despite her reputation for finding and identifying fossils, the men who dominated the scientific community often did not acknowledge her work. Today, the Natural History Museum in London showcases several of Mary Anning’s finds.

For more than 50 years, NOAA has designed, deployed and maintained observational platforms that collect measurements on global, regional, and local scales. We collect measurements every day from a wide array of observing platforms (top left image) to advance scientific understanding of greenhouse gases’ sources and sinks (where they come from and where they end up). Society’s ability to understand and address the root causes of global warming, and associated climatic changes, depends on the scientific evidence gathered by NOAA’s observing platforms. Likewise, NOAA GHG data are essential to understanding whether, where, and to what extent emission-reduction and carbon dioxide removal strategies are effective, today and into the future.

Icons on this global show where and what types of measurements are collected around the world. This map shows the locations where measurements of carbon dioxide at the ocean’s surface have been made around the world for at least a decade. Red lines show the tracks of NOAA ships and uncrewed surface vehicles; gray lines show non-NOAA watercraft. Red squares show locations of NOAA's moored buoys; gray squares show non-NOAA buoys.

Credit: NOAA Climate Program Office, Graphic by Anna Eshelman Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a category of gases that absorb heat energy emitted from the planet's surface and they remain in Earth's atmosphere for a long time (from decades to centuries). Though they make up only a small portion of the atmosphere (less than 1% of all air molecules), GHGs absorb a significant amount of heat energy and re-radiate some of it back toward the surface. They're called \"greenhouse gases\" because they trap heat near the Earth's surface in a manner somewhat similar to how a greenhouse allows in the sun’s rays and then holds in the resulting heat. Learn more at the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory By adding more GHGs, like carbon dioxide and methane, to the atmosphere, humans are causing average global temperature to rise at an unprecedented rate. Earth has warmed by an average of 0.11°F (0.06°C) per decade since",
