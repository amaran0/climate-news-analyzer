  "content": "Historical records of temperature and precipitation give you a way to see how they have changed over time. You can generate graphs showing temperature, precipitation, and other parameters for areas as large as the entire contiguous United States to as small as a single city (data are available for almost 200 selected cities).\nTemperature and precipitation are recorded at regular intervals at weather and climate stations across the country, both through manual observation and by automated instruments. After these data are compiled and quality checked, they are included in various databases.  The U.S. Climate Divisional Database provides the data for statewide, regional, climate divisions, and agricultural divisions in this graphing tool. City data are from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) and the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN).\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nUse the pull-down menus to select your options of interest:\nHelp us improve our content",
