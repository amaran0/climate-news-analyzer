  "date": null,
  "content": "Clouds can both cool climate by reflecting sunlight and warm it by absorbing and re-emitting thermal radiation. As a result, depending on the specific cloud properties, clouds can either strengthen or weaken greenhouse gas-induced warming. This effect is known as cloud feedback. A recent paper, published in Geophysical Research Letters, investigates how cloud feedback is represented in climate models. The work by Princeton University and University of Miami researchers distinguishes between climate models with low and high climate sensitivity due to aerosol-cloud interactions, helping scientists to better understand and reduce uncertainty in future climate projections.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
