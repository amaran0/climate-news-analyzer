Credit: NOAA\nDan McEvoy, a researcher at the Desert Research Institute, has been awarded funding for their role as a co-PI in the climate projections project, “Understanding the Evolving Threat of Snow Loads and Rain on Snow Events to Structural Safety.”\nIn this study addressing the vulnerability of structures to extreme snow loads, Utah State University’s Brennan Bean will lead the study with support from Dan McEvoy of the Desert Research Institute, aiming to revolutionize design standards outlined by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), an integral part of building codes in the United States. Focusing on the potential increase in rain-on-snow (ROS) events due to climate change, the team uses the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s SPEAR forecast system and climate models to simulate and predict extreme snow load scenarios. The study has the potential to provide the first-ever climate-change-informed design recommendations for the ASCE tool, ensuring the safety and resilience of structures in the face of evolving climate conditions. McEvoy will lead the creation of the ROS frequency model, estimating co-occurrence with peak snow loads, and validating the DRI ROS model. This work aligns directly with NOAA’s partnership with the ASCE to prepare the nation for the impacts of a changing environment with climate-ready infrastructure.\nClick to read the full article",
