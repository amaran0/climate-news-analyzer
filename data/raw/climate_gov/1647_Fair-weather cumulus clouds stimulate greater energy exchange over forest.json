Credit: USGS\nNew research in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres found that low, fair-weather, cumulus clouds stimulate stronger surface energy exchange in comparison to other sky conditions over a forested landscape in northern Wisconsin. CIRES scientist Joseph Sedlar led the research along with a team of scientists from CIRES, NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory, Global Systems Laboratory, and Physical Sciences Laboratory.\nAs cloud conditions directly modify the solar and infrared radiation reaching the Earthâ€™s surface, energy exchange responses affect the warming and cooling processes near the surface, driving the local weather systems, as well as the dispersion of trace gases, particles, and pollution, impacting human health.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
