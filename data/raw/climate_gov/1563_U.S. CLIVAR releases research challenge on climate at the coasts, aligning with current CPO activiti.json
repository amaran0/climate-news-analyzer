Credit: NOAA\nU.S. CLIVAR has recently released a white paper addendum to their Science Plan, introducing their Research Challenge on Climate at the Coasts. U.S. CLIVAR is supported by NOAA, including CPO’s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) and Climate Variability and Predictability (CVP) programs. The white paper identifies opportunities for the United States to increase its understanding of coasts as a complex system, one that is becoming increasingly vulnerable to both extreme weather and climate change. Many of the opportunities highlighted align with current CPO activities and competitions.\nHome to 13 of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, our nation’s coasts face hurricanes, sea level rise, coastal erosion, natural resource depletion and more. While coastal challenges are inherently interdisciplinary and broader than any single agency can address, NOAA is a key player included in U.S. CLIVAR’s discussion of program coordination. In fact, CPO’s Climate Risk Areas Initiative is highlighted within the paper itself as a means to address pressing areas of concern, including coastal inundation and marine ecosystems, in an integrative and interdisciplinary manner.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
