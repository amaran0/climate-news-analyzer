Scientists at Scripps, which maintains an independent record, calculated a monthly average of 420.78 ppm. \n“The science is irrefutable: humans are altering our climate in ways that our economy and our infrastructure must adapt to,” said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. “We can see the impacts of climate change around us every day. The relentless increase of carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa is a stark reminder that we need to take urgent, serious steps to become a more Climate Ready Nation.”\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
