Credit: Pixabay\nThe Climate Program Office (CPO) is announcing eight new three-year projects in Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) that aim to increase our understanding of methane’s significance in the atmosphere by exploring global, regional and local concentration and trends, modeling methane budgets and frameworks for measurement and verification of emissions. The competitively selected projects total $5.3 million in grants1. These projects will improve understanding of atmospheric methane budgets (sources and sinks) in order to inform successful policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, address major sources of uncertainty in methane measurements and modeling, and ultimately reduce community-level methane emissions.\nClick to read the full article",
