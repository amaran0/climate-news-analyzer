Credit: Drought Monitor\nTropical storms are rapidly rotating storm systems with an organized center over warm tropical oceans and maximum sustained surface winds ranging from 39-73 mph. These storms can range dramatically in size and produce many hazards to the affected areas, such as storm surge, coastal flooding, inland flooding, destructive winds, and tornadoes.\nMuch research has been done on the impact tropical cyclones have on drought, but the contribution of weaker tropical storms on the drought intensity in the US is not often investigated. Research shows that rainfall is not always proportional to the wind scale of the tropical cyclone and therefore, in some cases tropical storms may produce more rainfall. Researchers are now asking whether tropical storms can help mitigate and alleviate drought conditions in the affected areas.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
