Credit: Nicolas Gruber/ ETH Zurich\nToday (June 6), NOAA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) on future collaborations regarding marine carbon dioxide removal research and development. As a climate solution, marine carbon dioxide removal is an important pathway to achieve the broader Biden Administration goal for the U.S. to reach net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.\nThis MOA will formalize collaboration between NOAA and DOE to share expertise on research and technology development, as well as avoid duplicative work. The MOA makes clear that combining the ocean science expertise of NOAA with the carbon dioxide removal and energy science and technology expertise of DOE will be a powerful way to advance the state of marine carbon dioxide removal science and strengthen the existing relationship between both agencies.\nClick to read the full article",
