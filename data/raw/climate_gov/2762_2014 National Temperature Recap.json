Maps are based on U.S. Climate Division data from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center.\nThe Lower 48 United States was 0.5°F above average in 2014, making it the thirty-fourth warmest year in the historical record (1895-2014).  Nine states across the West had a top-10-warmest year, while seven states across the Midwest and Mississippi Valley had a top-10-coolest year.\nMonthly temperatures swung widely from warm to cool to warm late in the year.  The year ended with the second warmest December on record. Overall, it was the eighteenth year in a row with annual temperature warmer than the twentieth-century average.\nFor more 2014 national climate statistics, visit\nhttp://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/national/2014/12\n********\nFAQ: Why don’t you show Alaska or Hawaii?\nThe shorter length and sparser geographic coverage of the data records for our nation’s most far-flung states makes it difficult to combine those records with others from the rest of the United States in a single, consistent analysis. You can obtain climate statistics for individual observing stations from the National Weather Service Regional Headquarters’ websites for Alaska and Hawaii.\nHelp us improve our content",
