  "content": "Wind roses are graphical charts that characterize the speed and direction of winds at a location. Presented in a circular format, the length of each \"spoke\" around the circle indicates the amount of time that the wind blows from a particular direction. Colors along the spokes indicate categories of wind speed. This site offers wind roses for each month of the year and instructions for interpreting them. Graphics are available for 237 cities across the United States. Note that this is a historical data product: it shows average wind speed and direction measured from 1961-1990.\nLearn more about Wind Roses »\nThe US Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service prepared these wind roses. The plots are based on hourly data from the Solar and Meteorological Surface Observation Network.\nBackground: Winds measured at airports are normally 2 or 3 minute averages of 3 or 5 second samples at the top of every hour—not gusts. Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) equipment used at most locations since 1996 or so automatically records wind measurements from cup anemometer values. Older observations (generally prior to 1996) represent data recorded by personnel working at weather stations who manually observed wind speed and direction at the top of every hour, and made an estimation of hourly winds over some time period, typically 2 to 5 minutes in length.\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
