Federally designated floodplains in NC were mapped over 10 years ago and have likely grown as a result of climate change. Floodplains can also grow through housing development where surfaces that catch and hold water are replaced with impermeable surfaces such as roads or roofs. Governments often use home buyouts in floodplains and change their land use to reduce flood risks.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
