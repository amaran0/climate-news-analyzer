Credit: Pixabay\nThe public health threat of air pollution in Africa, which already results in 1.1 million premature deaths annually, is expected to intensify under rapid urbanization and population growth. To develop strategies for improving air quality monitoring and research in East Africa, scientists from around the world convened for workshops virtually in 2021 and in-person in Kigali, Rwanda in 2023. The Climate Program Officeâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) program partially supported the Kigali workshop.
