  "content": "How much of the Northern Hemisphere is covered with snow and ice today? How has that changed over the satellite record?\nDaily maps, charts, and animations show the extent of snow and ice over the contiguous United States, Alaska, or the whole Northern Hemisphere. You can explore sequences of images to see how snow and ice cover grow and shrink over a year or change from decade to decade.\nInstruments on satellites measure the reflectance of Earth's surface in various wavelengths every day. Snow and ice have a recognizable pattern of reflectance, so the satellite data can be processed to show where snow and ice are present.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nAccess static daily images or download images to generate animations showing how the extent of snow and ice changes in response to storms or the progression of seasons\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
