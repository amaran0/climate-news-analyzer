  "content": "Running time 75:19\nClaudia Mengelt and Robert Fri talk about coping with climate change. What short-term actions can be taken to respond effectively to climate change? What promising long-term strategies, investments, and opportunities could be pursued? This session summarizes the findings from a recent series of reports by the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science highlighting options for adapting to and mitigating global climate change.\nAbout the Presenters\nRobert Fri is a visiting scholar and senior fellow emeritus at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit organization that studies natural resource and environmental issues. He has served as director of the National Museum of Natural History, president of Resources for the Future and deputy administrator of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Research and Development Administration. Fri also has been director of the American Electric Power Company, vice-chair and a director of the Electric Power Research Institute, a trustee and vice-chair of Science Service, Inc. and a member of the National Petroleum Council. He is active with the National Academies of Science, where he is a national associate and vice-chair of the Board on Energy and Environmental Systems, and is a member of the advisory board of the Marion E. Koshland Science Museum. He has chaired studies for the National Research Council on health standards for the Yucca Mountain repository and on estimating the benefits of applied research programs at the Department of Energy (DOE). He currently chairs a study to evaluate the nuclear energy research program at DOE. Fri received his BA in physics from Rice University and his MBA from Harvard University.

She was the study director of Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change, a report that was part of the congressionally mandated study, America’s Climate Choices. At the NRC, she has been leading studies on a range of topics, including the analysis of global change assessments. Mengelt obtained her master’s degree in biological oceanography from the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. She subsequently received her PhD in marine sciences from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
