  "content": "Released in 2023, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) includes an Art × Climate Gallery. The gallery collection features the work of 92 artists, selected from more than 800 submissions. This art may only be reproduced or re-used in connection with the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Any other use must be negotiated with the author.\nNCA5’s Focus on Blue Carbon discusses the potential benefits of ocean storage of carbon. Ecosystems as diverse as coastal wetlands, mangroves, and seagrass beds can all absorb carbon, and they can do so at faster rates than many terrestrial ecosystems. So long as these carbon sinks remain undisturbed, they may keep carbon out of the atmosphere for tens to thousands of years. Estimates based on global emissions in 2019 and 2020 indicate that conservation and restoration of blue carbon environments may offset roughly 3 percent of global emissions each year. Such protection would have co-benefits for marine life like manatees.\nAmalija M. painted this watercolor picture in 2023, and the image was selected as a youth entry (grade 11). This is Amalija M’s artist statement:\nManatees are aquatic animals that are often impacted by human activity. Whether it's interference by ships, fishing equipment, or even habitat destruction, they remain a threatened animal. I wanted to depict manatees in their usual habitat, peacefully swimming through the water. We should be taking steps in order to coexist with sea life, without causing them harm. We should be working to protect sea life, to respect their environments—instead of damaging them. I hope that I can bring awareness to this issue, and inspire better appreciation for marine life.\nHelp us improve our content",
