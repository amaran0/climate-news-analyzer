  "content": "HYSPLIT is NOAA’s Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory atmospheric dispersion model.\nNOAA’s Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) developed and maintains the HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) atmospheric dispersion model. Recent work partially supported by CPO’s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, & Climate (AC4) program integrated features from a widely-used greenhouse gas emissions model into HYSPLIT, demonstrating how competitive grant projects entrain science into NOAA assets. This is highlighted in a recent study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology.\nARL’s HYSPLIT model simulates a range of atmospheric features such as emissions, transport, dispersion, deposition, and chemistry. The model is used for both operational and research dispersion products. For instance, NWS uses HYSPLIT products to forecast the transport and dispersion of hazardous materials from industrial accidents to protect lives and property.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
