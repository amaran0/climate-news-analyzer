  "content": "Energy-detecting instruments on satellites give humans a way to monitor the status of vegetation around the world from space. The data can also indicate drought, soil saturation, fire risk, start/end of the growing season, and crop and pasture productivity.\nThe Global Vegetation Health Products are created and maintained by the Environmental Monitoring Branch of the NOAA NESDIS Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR). Data and images are derived from the radiance (type and amount of energy) observed by the VIIRS sensor. VIIRS stands for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite. The VIIRS sensor is located onboard the Soumi-NPP satellite. If you have further questions or comments about the Global Vegetation Health Products, you can reach out to Dr. Jerry Zhan or the STAR webmaster.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
