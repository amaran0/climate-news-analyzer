Credit: NOAA\nOn December 1, 2022, NOAA released a new strategy and invited the public to join upcoming listening sessions that will guide the agency’s potential role in an important part of understanding and addressing climate change — carbon dioxide removal.\nClimate change already affects every part of the globe, with potentially dire consequences for many ecosystems and human communities. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to galvanizing global climate action to meet climate goals and build resilient communities, economies and ecosystems. To address the impacts of climate change, it is necessary to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide.\nThere is also ongoing research into the potential for removing the carbon dioxide that has already accumulated in the atmosphere, and scientists are examining methods for the long term storage of carbon dioxide on land or in the ocean. NOAA has summarized some of the current science on this topic in a new report, and is asking the public to comment on the agency’s potential future role in carbon dioxide removal research.\nRead more or register at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
