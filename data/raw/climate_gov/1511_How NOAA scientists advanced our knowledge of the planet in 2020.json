That’s one big takeaway from the 2020 NOAA Science Report, which outlines our agency’s key scientific accomplishments from 2020.\nWe’ve highlighted a few of the biggest accomplishments from across our agency below.\nClimate artifacts, or “proxies,” allow scientists to compare Earth’s current climate to the climate of the past. In April 2020, NOAA released the most comprehensive database ever assembled of these proxies, which include tree rings, ice cores, fossil pollen, ocean sediments and more. The database tells the story of Earth’s temperatures over the last 12,000 years, helping scientists understand the potential implications of our current climate change, and helping communities plan for the future.\nRead more at the link below or explore the NOAA Science Report for yourself.\nClick to read the full article",
