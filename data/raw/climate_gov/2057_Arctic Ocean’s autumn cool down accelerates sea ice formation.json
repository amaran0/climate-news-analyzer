Credit: NOAA\nStudying the Arctic’s surface energy budget during autumn helps us understand Earth’s transitions from summer warmth to winter freeze, which is vital for predicting climate changes. Using shipboard data from NASA and satellite heat flux analyses from 2022, researchers examined how energy exchanges at the sea surface change over the year. They discovered that the transition from summer heating to autumn cooling aligns closely with the September 22nd equinox, marking the start of prolonged Arctic darkness. The shift involves dramatic ocean surface cooling, driven by cold air from landmasses and ice caps. These findings highlight the significant role of astronomical seasons in regulating the Arctic’s energy dynamics.\nClick to read the full article",
