Credit: NOAA / HHS / A. Enshelman\nOn Friday, May 6th, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™ (HHS) Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), in partnership with NOAA and the National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS), launched the first installment of a new public information series called the Climate and Health Outlook.
