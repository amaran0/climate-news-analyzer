Credit: DOE, NOAA\nMCB refers to the deliberate injection of aerosol particles into marine clouds to increase their reflection of solar radiation to temporarily cool the planet while decarbonization efforts are pursued. A workshop was conducted to assess the state of knowledge in the field, and to provide a possible research path toward reducing unknowns in key components of the underlying physical science. This three-day workshop took place in April 2022 and was jointly sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE)â€™s Atmospheric System Research (ASR) program and NOAA's Earth's Radiation Budget (ERB) program.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
