Scientists have used models and past climate proxies like tree rings to understand exactly how this climate disruption affected Earth before the rise of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Model simulations and paleoclimate reconstruction have not matched up in prior research, and a new Climate of the Past study sheds light on why. An international research team, including Kevin Anchukaitis of the University of Arizona, who is supported by a grant from the Climate Program Officeâ€™s Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program, tried a new approach to modeling past volcanic impacts.\nClick to read the full article",
