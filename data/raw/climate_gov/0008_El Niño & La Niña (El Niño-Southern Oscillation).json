  "content": "After just a few months of La Niña conditions, the tropical Pacific is now ENSO-neutral, and forecasters expect neutral to continue through the Northern Hemisphere summer.\nEl Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool phases of a natural climate pattern across the tropical Pacific known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or “ENSO” for short. The pattern shifts back and forth irregularly every two to seven years, bringing predictable changes in ocean temperature and disrupting the normal wind and rainfall patterns across the tropics. These changes in the seasonal climate of the world's biggest ocean have a cascade of global side effects.\nLa Niña has ended, and the tropical Pacific is now in a neutral state—neither La Niña nor El Niño. Without those strong patterns influencing the atmosphere, it’s harder to anticipate seasonal shifts in rain, storms, or temperatures. Neutral likely lasts through fall.\nMore U.S. impacts\nENSO conditions can affect the climate over sizable portions of the globe, including regions far removed from the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño and La Niña have weaker impacts during Northern Hemisphere summer than they do in winter.\nOn the second Thursday of each month, scientists with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center in collaboration with forecasters at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) release an official update on the status of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here is a description of the categories and criteria they use.\nSummary of NOAA decision process in determining El Niño conditions.
