  "content": "Cuba experienced extreme drought conditions in 2011, extending the dry spell that began in 2009 and marking one of the driest years in the nation’s history. Cubans were confronted with a serious shortage in water supplies as reservoirs fell as low as one-fifth of their normal levels. Tens of thousands of residents collected freshwater in buckets and bottles from delivery trucks, according to the BBC.\nThe map above shows the difference from average annual precipitation across Central America and the Caribbean region for 2011. Shades of brown indicate areas that received up to 30 inches less than average precipitation while green indicates up to 30 inches more than average.\nMap based on daily composites of precipitation data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis project, provided by NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory. Reviewed by Jessica Blunden and Deke Arndt.\nHelp us improve our content",
