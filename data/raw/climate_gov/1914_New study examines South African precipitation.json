Credit: USGS\nSouth Africa is prone to precipitation changes, with drought and flooding events being common occurrences. Understanding the rainfall variability over South Africa is of great interest, as Cape Town was one of the first major cities in the world to nearly run out of water in 2018 and is home to a significant population dependent on rain-fed agriculture. South African climate variability has been linked to changes in the Agulhas system and external forcing. The Agulhas system, also known as the Agulhas Current, is a warm western boundary current of the South Indian Ocean. Located along the eastern coast of Africa, it is one of the strongest currents in the world. Research shows that convection driven by the warm Agulhas sea surface temperatures (SST) can explain precipitation patterns over eastern and northern South Africa. But what effects can a warming planet have on the Agulhas system and rainfall for South Africa?\nClick to read the full article",
