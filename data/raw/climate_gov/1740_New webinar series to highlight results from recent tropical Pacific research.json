Credit: TPOS 2020\nNOAA/CPO Climate Variability and Predictability (CVP) Program will host a webinar series on the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) Pre-Field Modeling Studies that will highlight the recent results from the CVP-funded projects. The goal of these modeling studies is to refine the current scientific understanding of the equatorial Pacific climate system, with a specific focus on two process studies identified in the TPOS 2020 First Report, “Pacific Upwelling and Mixing Physics (PUMP)” and “Air–sea Interaction at the eastern edge of the Warm Pool (EEWP)”. Their results will assist in the planning of future field campaigns.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
