These corals have built strong and diverse communities on man-made substrates, such as seawalls and discarded objects.\nScientists visited the Port of Miami over a three-year period beginning in 2018 to monitor environmental conditions and measure coral community dynamics. The research team used a suite of state-of-the-art instruments that included sub-surface autonomous samplers designed at CIMAS/AOML and coral photomosaics.\nThe samplers monitored the temperature, pH, oxygen, carbonate chemistry, light, and tidal flow at three reef sites. Photomosaics consisting of thousands of high resolution underwater photos stitched together created detailed maps of these habitats to characterize their coral cover, spread, and species diversity.\nClick to read the full article",
