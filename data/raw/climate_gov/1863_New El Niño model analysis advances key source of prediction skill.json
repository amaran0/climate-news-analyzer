Credit: NOAA Climate.gov\nHurricanes, droughts, floods, and severe weather in the United States are all driven by what's going on in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean -- whether it is warmer, as in El Nino conditions; cooler, as in La Nina conditions; or normal. The sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in this region can either add heat to (El Nino) or remove heat from (La Nina) the atmosphere altering global weather patterns. But the connection between the remote behavior of equatorial Pacific SSTs and the weather and climate experienced 4,000 miles away in the United States is driven by a long chain of ocean-to-atmosphere links that climate models do not always capture.\nClick to read the full article",
