Shades of brown indicate areas that received up to eight inches less than average precipitation for the month while green indicates up to eight inches more than average.\nMeanwhile, daily high temperatures were well above normal in most locations. Fairbanks set a new record high on May 27, topping out at 85°F—3°F warmer than the previous record for that day.
