Credit: NOAA\nNatural processes and human activities produce vast amounts of dead vegetation which return carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through decay and combustion. Now a new article published in Climatic Change—led by researcher Philip M. Orton, funded through CPO’s Urban Northeast RISA team, and his co-author Leonard A. Miller—describes a method for sequestering this carbon that could help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The method involves converting decaying vegetation into a form of biocoal called Black Pellets and depositing them in the deep ocean..\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
