Credit: doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0670.1\nSea level rise (SLR) is a major consequence of climate change. The densely populated U.S. East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico coast are vulnerable to SLR and extreme events. In the past six years, for example, major hurricanes and associated storm surges have caused significant and catastrophic coastal flooding and socioeconomic damages. Studying factors behind the increased coastal vulnerability, particularly the role of SLR in extreme events, is therefore urgently needed. With the advance of sea level observations and modeling, progress has been made recently so that SLR at different locations and its time-evolving behaviors can be better explained and attributed.\nRead more at the link below\nClick to read the full article",
