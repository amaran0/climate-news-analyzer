  "content": "NOAA's Sea Level Rise map viewer gives users a way to visualize community-level impacts from coastal flooding or sea level rise (up to 10 feet above average high tides). Photo simulations of how future flooding might impact local landmarks are also provided, as well as data related to water depth, connectivity, flood frequency, socio-economic vulnerability, wetland loss and migration, and mapping confidence. The viewer shows areas along the contiguous United States coast, except for the Great Lakes.\nThe Sea Level Rise Viewer is created and maintained through NOAA's Office for Coastal Management Digital Coast. The maps are produced using detailed elevation maps with local and regional tidal variability. You can find additional information about the tool  - including videos, tutorials, FAQs, and mapping methods - on its landing page. If you have further questions or comments about the Sea Level Rise Viewer, you can reach out through the Digital Coast contact form.\nHow do I use the site?\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHelp us improve our content",
