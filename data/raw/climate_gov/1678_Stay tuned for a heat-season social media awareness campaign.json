Credit: NOAA/iStock\nThe National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) Interagency Communications Group will be holding a heat season awareness social media campaign during the week of May 16th, 2022. This campaign is a federal collaboration on heat communication to raise awareness about the risk of extreme heat, and to provide audiences with information about preparedness and actions to take to prevent heat-related illnesses and death. The Interagency Communications team chose the week of May 16th in order to reach citizens at the start of the heat season, as heat-related illnesses and deaths are preventable.\nIn this social media campaign, participating agencies will be sharing resources, guides, infographics, and key messages related to heat and health. Agencies will be posting their own content, as well as sharing the content of the other participating agencies. Agency leadership will also be sharing the posts on their social media accounts, including NOAA Administrator Dr. Richard Spinrad and EPA Administrator Michael Regan. Participating agencies in this NIHHIS social media campaign include NOAA, CDC, EPA, FEMA, NHTSA, NIOSH, OSHA, and USDA/USFS. NIHHIS has previously held social media campaigns regarding heat season awareness.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
