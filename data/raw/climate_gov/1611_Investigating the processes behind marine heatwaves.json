Credit: NOAA\nWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) researchers, funded by CPO’s Climate Variability & Predictability Program (CVP) use a combination of observations and modeling to describe, simulate, and understand the physical processes which led to a marine heatwave in the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf in 2017.\nPublished in JGR Oceans, the WHOI team’s research shows how circulation patterns influence cross-shelf exchange and offers new insights about cross-shelf exchange during a time when the Atlantic is undergoing increased warming and more frequent marine heatwave events.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
