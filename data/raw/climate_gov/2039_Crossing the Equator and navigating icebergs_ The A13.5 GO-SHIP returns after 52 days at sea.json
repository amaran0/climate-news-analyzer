Heading south from Cabo Verde on February 1st, the international team of researchers spent weeks collecting data essential for investigating global changes in ocean physics and chemistry – most notably, the uptake of atmospheric carbon under a changing climate.\nThrough orange sunsets and wild seas with waves that rocked the 235-foot R/V Marcus Langseth, scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, and the Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies were among the crew leading efforts to analyze water samples.\nClick to read the full article",
