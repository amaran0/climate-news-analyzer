Credit: NASA\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a well-defined zonally-oriented band of high precipitation, which strongly influences rainfall patterns in the tropics. Although it is centered a few degrees to the north of the equator, it meanders north-south depending on the season. ITCZ behavior is better studied and analyzed by long-term oceanic records, but observational data are still limited in temporal extent. Shallow-water corals can be more useful, as they provide seasonally-resolved archives of climate variability over the tropical ocean. CPOâ€™s Climate Variability and Predictability (CVP) program-funded PI K.H. Kilbourne (UMD-CES), was part of an international group of researchers that further explored the usefulness of these archives.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
