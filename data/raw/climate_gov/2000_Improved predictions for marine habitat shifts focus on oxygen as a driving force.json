Credit: Pixabay\nIn new research on marine habitat prediction, scientists supported by the Climate Program Officeâ€™s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program evaluate how different species respond to ocean dynamics in a changing climate. Zhoumin Chen of the University of Connecticut worked with MAPP-supported scientists Samantha Siedlecki, Matthew Long, and Colleen Petrik to improve the predictability of habitat shifts in the upper 600 meters of the ocean over interannual to decadal timescales. MAPP funded this project to work toward incorporating fish catch, fish distributions, and food web structure into the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and National Center for Atmospheric Research Earth-system models.\nClick to read the full article",
