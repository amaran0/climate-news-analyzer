Credit: NASA\nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the climate through its transport of heat in the North Atlantic Ocean. Decadal changes in the AMOC, whether through internal variability or anthropogenically forced weakening, have wide-ranging impacts. A new study, performed by a group of scientists from the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States uses evidence from observations, ocean reanalyses, forced models, and proxies to expand the understanding of contemporary decadal variability in the AMOC. The study, in which CPOâ€™s Climate Variability & Predictability (CVP) program-funded scientist Martha W. Buckley (George Mason University) collaborated, was recently published in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
