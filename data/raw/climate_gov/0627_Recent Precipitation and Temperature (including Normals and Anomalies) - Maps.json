  "content": "This site offers a huge assortment of maps and charts that put recent precipitation and temperatures in a climate context. Maps show how current conditions compare to Normal (long-term averages) for various time periods for the United States. Some data maps show data for the whole globe.\nPrecipitation data are from CPC's Unified Precipitation Analysis (based on rain gauges and gridded sampling). Temperature data are from River Forecast Centers and Climate Assessment Data Base. 1981-2010 climatologies (\"Normals\") are used to calculate anomalies.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nClick a link of interest and follow instructions to view specific products.\nHelp us improve our content",
