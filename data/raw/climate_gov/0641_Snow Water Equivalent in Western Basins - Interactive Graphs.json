  "content": "Generate graphs that show cumulative snow water equivalent in river basins in western states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\nA network of Snow Telemetry sites—called SNOTEL—estimates snow water equivalent across basins by weighing the amount of snow that lands on pressure-sensitive snow pillows at stations across the west. Additional measurements come from automated stations and stations where people take manual measurements of snow.\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
