This group of 20 simulations projected the climate-forcing influence of hypothetical sulfate aerosol injections in the stratosphere sufficient to reflect enough sunlight to counter global warming from rising carbon dioxide levels throughout the end of the 21st century.\nLead author Antara Banerjee, a CIRES research scientist working at NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory, said that the model required enormous inputs of sulfur dioxide to counter the expected warming—as much as 50 million metric tons would need to be continuously injected into the stratosphere every year by the end of the century to obtain zero global-mean temperature change even as carbon dioxide continues to increase.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
