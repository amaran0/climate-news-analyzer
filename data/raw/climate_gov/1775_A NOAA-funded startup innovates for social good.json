This is because each unit is expensive to build, requires significant time to deploy, and requires multiple, highly-skilled personnel to manage the equipment.\nBecause of real-world, situational testing opportunities such as the wildfire event, Access Sensor Technologies has been able to demonstrate that their modernized air sampling technology is cost-effective and easily programmable, can be quickly deployed, and is able to produce spatially comprehensive, high-quality data.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
