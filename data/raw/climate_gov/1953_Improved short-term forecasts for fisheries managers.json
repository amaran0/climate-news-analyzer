Credit: NOAA\nA new study, funded by the Climate Program Office’s Climate Variability & Predictability (CVP) Program, uses novel observational data for the first time to analyze forecasts of acidity and oxygen at the ocean’s surface and subsurface. Climate change is causing rapid changes in the global ocean: strong warming, increasing acidity, and declining oxygen trends. A team of CVP-supported researchers from NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center, University of Colorado, Boulder, and Brown University, addressed the growing need to predict these short-term changes to better inform marine fisheries managers. CVP supported this work to evaluate the ability of current forecast systems in the California Current System.\nClick to read the full article",
