Throughout this active season, NOAA scientists set new records in tropical cyclone research that will improve forecasting accuracy, enhance our understanding of storm behavior, and strengthen preparedness efforts for communities in hurricane-prone regions. Their dedication and innovation contribute to a safer and more resilient future for those facing the impacts of extreme weather events.\nNOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and NOAA’s Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) flew into eight different tropical cyclones and conducted a total of 67 operational and research missions aboard the NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft. These missions started as early as June with Category 5 Hurricane Beryl as it rapidly intensified in the Caribbean, and continued as late as November as Hurricane Rafael moved northward towards Cuba and the Gulf.\nResearch missions were conducted in partnership with NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), and operational missions were requested by NOAA’s National Hurricane Center and the Environmental Modeling Center to collect data and observations that are crucial for improving track and intensity forecasts.\nClick to read the full article",
