Previous studies have shown that corals growing in environments with natural temperature variability experience less bleaching when exposed to increased temperatures.\nCoral bleaching, a process in which the colorful algae living inside the coral’s tissue is expelled, leaving the coral white in appearance, can occur as a response to stressors like increased water temperatures. Bleached corals are in a stressed state, vulnerable to disease but may sometimes recover.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
