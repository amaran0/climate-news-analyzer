Credit: NOAA Climate.gov\nResearch has shown that an accurate representation of tropical weather can have a positive effect on Weeks 3-4 lead time extratropical forecasts. Retrospective forecasts, more commonly known as hindcasts, are performed with the tropics forced to closely match observational estimates. This allows for improved US West Coast precipitation forecasts in comparison to those without forcing. However, the origin of these improvements is not yet fully understood. In an attempt to do so, researchers from various institutions in Colorado (CSU, CU Boulder, NOAA/PSL) used a machine-learning method that subsets hindcasts by their initial conditions.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
