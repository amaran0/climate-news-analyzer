Credit: NOAA Air Resources Laboratory\nTo tackle gaps in our understanding of how nitrogen cycles between air, plants, and soil, the Climate Program Officeâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) Program supported new research to compare experimental measurements with widely used atmospheric models. Through a grant aimed toward improving our understanding of the nitrogen cycle, AC4-funded scientist Ronald Cohen of the University of California, Berkeley alongside Erin Delaria of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center demonstrated important variability in nitrogen reactions that is not captured in simplified models.\nClick to read the full article",
