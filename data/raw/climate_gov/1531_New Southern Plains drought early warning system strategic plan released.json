Credit: NOAA\nLast week, the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) released the Southern Plains Drought Early Warning System (DEWS) 2021–2025 Strategic Action Plan. The Plan is designed to set priorities and suggest measurable actions that can create value in this drought-prone region, with the ultimate goal of improving stakeholder resilience during times of drought.\nThe development of the Southern Plains DEWS was initiated in 2011 during a record-setting drought across the southern tier of the United States.
