Credit: NOAA\nThe NOAA/CPO Climate Variability and Predictability (CVP) Program will host a webinar series on Decadal Climate Variability and Predictability that will highlight the recent results from the CVP-funded projects. The goal of these modeling studies is to identify the state, mechanisms, and sources of climate predictability on the interannual to decadal timescale. This research will lead to future improvements in skillful decadal prediction systems for climateâ€”ocean and atmosphere.\nThe webinar series will have eight sessions (running on a weekly basis) starting on Thursday, April 20, 2023 and ending on Thursday, June 8, 2023.\nClick to read the full article",
