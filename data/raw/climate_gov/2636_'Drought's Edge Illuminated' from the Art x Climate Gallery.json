  "content": "Released in 2023, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) includes an Art × Climate Gallery. The gallery collection features the work of 92 artists, selected from more than 800 submissions. This art may only be reproduced or re-used in connection with the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Any other use must be negotiated with the author.\nNCA5 highlighted an ongoing challenge for the U.S. Southwest: the scarcity of water. The region has long experienced semi-arid conditions, punctuated by prolonged, severe droughts. In a warming climate, these conditions are expected to continue and likely worsen.\nLake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States, has experienced declining water levels since its near-capacity water level in 1998. To cope with water shortages, a solution may lie in multi-sector conservation and demand management. Farms can invest in efficient technologies such as drip irrigation and new crops. Urbanized and industrialized areas can engage in “water-smart” efficiencies including water conservation, recycling, and reuse improvements.\nReflecting on the region’s drought, Jon Bradham used oil paints on a linen canvas in 2021 to make this image. This is his statement:\nThis painting shows the beauty of the huge built environment and the colors and forms of nature. It also shows the stark problem of drought and overuse of water as populations grow, particularly in areas that are not predisposed to large human cities and agriculture. The bone-like wall of the shrinking lake should be a wakeup call to us all.\nHelp us improve our content",
