Credit: NOAA/NWS/Robert Hyatt\nThe Climate Program Officeâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) Program supported a new study that uses satellite data to analyze gases emitted from wildfires. Scientist Joost de Gouw of the University of Colorado, Boulder, worked with an international team of researchers to enhance our understanding of wildfire emissions beyond current forecasts. This work supports an AC4 initiative to advance science on fire and smoke at the interface between wildland and urban areas.\nAs wildfires grow larger and more frequent due to climate change, they significantly impact air quality. Current air quality forecasts and climate models overlook important changes in the composition of wildfire emissions as they shift from intense flames to smoldering combustion.\nClick to read the full article",
