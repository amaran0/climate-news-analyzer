  "content": "A new NOAA Fisheries study finds some of the first quantitative signs that three species of seals are experiencing impacts of warming in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. These three species—ribbon, spotted, and harbor seals—are all typically resilient, long-lived predators that eat a variety of prey.\nIn the past decade the Arctic region has undergone a rapid transformation. Temperatures rose. Sea ice extent and thickness fluctuated dramatically, reaching both record highs and lows within the past decade.\nEcological changes have been profound and relatively well-documented for fish and lower trophic (food web) levels. Scientists have observed changes in species distributions, reproductive and mortality rates, and body condition of individuals.\nChanges in upper trophic levels have been less apparent. Many predators are difficult to observe and monitor. Some, especially generalist predators, are thought to be relatively insensitive to short-term ecosystem shifts. Their ability to switch among diverse prey allows them to smoothly adapt to changes in a few prey species.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
