  "title": "October 2021 ENSO update: La Ni√±a is here!",
  "date": null,
  "content": "Our second-year La Ni√±a has materialized, as indicated by the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific. There‚Äôs an 87% chance of La Ni√±a this winter, the season when North American weather and climate are most affected by ENSO (El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation, the entire El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a system).\nThe first step on our ‚ÄúIs it La Ni√±a?‚Äù decision tree asks ‚Äúis the monthly Ni√±o-3.4 Index equal to or less than -0.5¬∞C?‚Äù The Ni√±o-3.4 Index, our primary metric for ENSO, is the anomaly in sea surface temperature in the central equatorial Pacific (anomaly = the difference from the long-term average; ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is 1991‚Äì2020 nowadays).\nFlowchart showing decision process for determining La Ni√±a conditions. Figure by Fiona Martin, adapted by Climate.gov.\nThe September Ni√±o-3.4 Index was -0.5¬∞C, according to ERSSTv5, our primary dataset. So it‚Äôs on to the next box on the decision tree! Do we think that anomaly will remain cooler than the La Ni√±a threshold? Again, yes! Nearly all computer models are currently predicting that the cooler-than-average conditions will remain through the winter. Another source of confidence for the Ni√±o-3.4 Index to remain cooler than the La Ni√±a threshold is the large amount of cooler-than-average water beneath the surface of the equatorial Pacific. This subsurface water provides a source for the surface, and it has been intensifying in recent weeks.\nWater temperatures in the top 700 meters (2,300 feet) of the tropical Pacific Ocean compared to the 1991-2020 average in late summer 2021. NOAA Climate.gov animation, based on data from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.\nThe final requirement to get to La Ni√±a conditions is that the atmosphere is showing signs of responding to that cooler-than-average surface water. Over the past month, the low-level winds near the equator, which usually blow from east to west (the trade winds), were stronger than average, as were the west-to-east winds high up in the atmosphere.\nThese signs, along with more rain than average over Indonesia and less in the central Pacific, tell us that the Walker circulation is juiced up. A stronger Walker circulation is the expected atmospheric response to La Ni√±a. The Walker circulation is driven by the difference between the very warm ocean surface in the far western Pacific and the relatively cool eastern Pacific; during La Ni√±a, this difference is enhanced, leading to a stronger Walker circulation.\nFollow the blue brick road, and we get to La Ni√±a!\nLa Ni√±a has probably earned silver-elite, frequent-flier status here, as this is the fourth time we‚Äôve written a ‚ÄúLa Ni√±a is here‚Äù post on the ENSO Blog! (Earlier posts are September 2020, November 2017, and November 2016.) That‚Äôs four of the seven-and-a-half years we‚Äôve been standing on this digital street corner yelling about ENSO.\nOverall, La Ni√±a is not more common that El Ni√±o‚Äîin the historical record dating back to 1950, there have been 25 El Ni√±os and 24 La Ni√±as (counting this year). However, La Ni√±a often occurs in consecutive winters, while El Ni√±o rarely does. The reason for this is difficult to explain in brief, but researchers think it‚Äôs partly due to differences in atmosphere-ocean coupling between La Ni√±a and El Ni√±o.\nAs you can see int he map below, the center of the ocean surface temperature anomaly tends to be a bit weaker and a bit farther west during La Ni√±a than El Ni√±o. The difference in strength and location means the trade winds response is not exactly opposite in La Ni√±a and El Ni√±o‚Äîunsurprisingly, the response tends to be weaker and centered farther west during La Ni√±a than El Ni√±o.\nAverage November ‚Äì January sea surface temperature anomalies (¬∞C) for the top 10 strongest (top) El Ni√±o and (bottom) La Ni√±a events since 1950 based on the November ‚Äì January Ni√±o3.4 index. Anomalies are calculated with respect to 30-year base periods updated every 5 years (see¬†here¬†for a description). NOAA Climate.gov figure with¬†ERSSTv5 data¬†obtained from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory.\nEl Ni√±o events end when the equatorial temperature anomalies are dispersed away from the equator, and this process tends to be less robust in La Ni√±a. The less-clean end to La Ni√±a means that it‚Äôs not hard for the system to tip back into La Ni√±a the next year. For more on how this works, check out Nat‚Äôs excellent post on double-dip La Ni√±a.\nWe‚Äôve already seen one likely effect of La Ni√±a this year‚Äîa more active Atlantic hurricane season, with nearly twice as many storms as average so far this year. But the most substantial La Ni√±a effect on North American rain, snow, and temperature happens during winter. In summary, La Ni√±a winters tend to be drier and warmer across the southern third of the U.S., and cooler in the northern U.S. and Canada. The Pacific Northwest, the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and parts of the Midwest tend to see more rain and snow than average.\nLa Ni√±a intensifies the average atmospheric circulation‚Äîsurface and high-altitude winds, rainfall, pressure patterns‚Äîin the tropical Pacific. Over the contiguous United States, the average location of the jet stream shifts northward. The southern tier of the country is often drier and warmer than average.

I would venture to state that the region from Quepos south to about Drake Bay will experience a drier and warmer weather pattern. I would expect to to begin in late October 2021 and last to about June 2022.\nSubmitted by HENRY QUESADA on Sat, 10/23/2021 - 20:57\nIn reply to Costa rica by Ashlee\nThanks for the updates, Emiley!\nI have two questions please:\nFirstly, What are the odds of strong lanina manifestation in the next 4 months ?\nSecond question: Will the La-palma volcanic plumes have any susbtantial impact on the 3.4 monthly estimates, or in other words does it have substantive impacts to account for and if any what are the possible consequence. I realize volcanic forcing can have different manifestations regionally and internationally¬† but the pictures from the Island over the last 4 weeks are indicative of some impact here and there .\nMany thanks again for your informative update.\nBR\nMohammad Alkhateeb .\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\nSubmitted by MOHAMMAD AL-KHATEEB on Fri, 10/15/2021 - 13:18\nWhile I can't speak to this specifically, I do track the weather of the western Sahel. Typically the rainy season doesn't arrive until the E Atlantic waters reach 29C. Therefore the regional cooling may make for a drier 2022 season. Great question though..... ¬†I look forward to NOAAs response.\nSubmitted by Tracy McC on Mon, 10/18/2021 - 10:22\nIn reply to La-palma plumes by MOHAMMAD AL-KHATEEB\nLol, please excuse us if we are not jumping for joy in California. Three out of the last four La Ninas. and the last three have resulted in below normal rainfall and last year's winter can only be described as a disaster. We are at the breaking point and I fear what is in store for us if we have another year like last year. The seasonal NMME precipitation model for this winter is concerning. We hope this winter we are done with La Nina for awhile. We will be praying for rain this winter.\nSubmitted by Bob on Fri, 10/15/2021 - 15:58\nWe also are hoping for rain for drought impacted places out west! The climate outlook for this winter comes out on October 21 to see what the scientists at Climate Prediction Center are thinking.\nSubmitted by tom.diliberto on Tue, 10/19/2021 - 11:45\nIn reply to Second year La Nina by Bob\nSo what does La Ni√±a/el nino typically mean for Cleveland??\nla Ni√±a typically means wetter, milder temps for much of Ohio, correct?¬†\nso with more precipitation and warmer/milder temps that means a more active lake mostly right? Milder means the lake doesn‚Äôt freeze as quickly.. therefore intensifying lake affect snow? However.. El Ni√±o keeps us colder but drier? Colder means whatever precipitation does come will likely be snow.\nhow does moderate, strong and weak La Nina‚Äôs differ for us? As well as that of El Ni√±o?\ni was looking at cleveland snow records going as far back as 1969-1970 up to 2020-2021. There‚Äôs no obvious pattern apparent ti me other than a few things..\nvery strong El Ni√±o usually give us much lower snow averages. There‚Äôs been 3 of those in my decades I‚Äôve mentioned and all turned out low snow averages.¬†\nstrong La Nina‚Äôs seem to bring us slightly higher snow totals. Moderate La Ni√±a seems to be about average totals. Weak La Ni√±a seems to vary as well as weak El Ni√±o‚Äôs.\njust trying to find anyone patterns or things to look at.\nanother thing work mentioning:\nin the 1969-2021 time frame, the highest recorded total was 117.9 and that was the winter of 2004-2005. This was a Weak El Ni√±o. The next highest was 101.1 in 1995-1996, this was a moderate La Ni√±a season. Then 100.5 inches in 1981-1982 and this was a non La Ni√±a/El nino event. But the next highest recorded that was one pattern or another was at 95.7 inches in 2002-2003 = moderate El Ni√±o. Another 90 inches was brought by a weak El Ni√±o in 1977-1978.\nseems weak El Ni√±o‚Äôs bring about some of the highest snow totals but have also brought significantly lower totals as well. Like the 35.2 inches in 2018-2019.\ndoesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs really any common theme though an that both systems vary at any given strength.¬†\nMaybe these aren‚Äôt so important after all for places like Cleveland ??\nSubmitted by Robert Rogers on Sat, 10/16/2021 - 00:09\nYou're right! There can be a lot of variability in winter snowfall for the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes.\nSeveral years ago we invited a guest blogger to look at exactly this topic. Check out this article which should hopefully answer some of your questions.\nhttps://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-about-snow-during‚Ä¶\nSubmitted by tom.diliberto on Tue, 10/19/2021 - 12:00\nIn reply to Cleveland by Robert Rogers\nHow would weak, moderate or strong La Nina affect Connecticut/Rhode Island? How would similar El Ninos affect these areas?\nSubmitted by Nutmeg State Girl on Sat, 10/16/2021 - 05:33\nOften times there isn't a clear signal across the Northeast for La Nina or El Nino. In general there is perhaps a slight tilt towards a wetter winter.\nBut check back on October 21 for the winter outlook to see what scientists are thinking.\nSubmitted by tom.diliberto on Tue, 10/19/2021 - 11:57\nIn reply to How La Ninas affect Connecticut or Rhode Island by Nutmeg State Girl\nRegarding:¬† \"Overall, La Ni√±a is not more common that El Ni√±o‚Äîin the historical record dating back to 1950, there have been 25 El Ni√±os and 24 La Ni√±as (counting this year).

Schoolhouse rock disagrees...\nhttps://youtu.be/yqk3XQk8CqY?t=10\nBut we definitely do agree with you that the Western drought is not fun. The use of the exclamation point in our title was in the vein of \"Oh, no!\" or \"Look out!\"\nSubmitted by rebecca.lindsey on Mon, 10/18/2021 - 09:31\nIn reply to Drought in California and the Southwest  by Paul\nI interpreted the title in the vein of \"We finally have a good guess!\" They are researchers after all.\nAs a Californian like you I am particularly interested in enso as well and love the content here as I continue to educate myself.\nWhile the drought is more likely to continue this is not certain. If you look at the other blog posts there is some good historical data. So I hope for rain anyway. (If I'm wrong please correct me as I'm just an enthusiast)\nAdditionally there are global implications and while visiting a climate blog, albeit the posts on here are from an American perspective, it's something I would think a lot of people have in mind while thinking climate.\nLa Nina means different things to everyone. So why interpret global implications from such a small scope and then think the title applies to your specific lens?\nI'm sure like me you are personally invested and have strong feelings about the implications, but something to keep in mind for when you come back!\nSubmitted by Patrick on Tue, 10/19/2021 - 05:56\nIn reply to Drought in California and the Southwest  by Paul\nHere in California we are hoping the climate models get it completely wrong this year and California gets a good rain/snow year. Another dry year similar to last year is going to be a disaster for California.\nSubmitted by Bob on Mon, 10/18/2021 - 19:56\nLiving in the SF Bay Area it is wonderful news that a La Nina producing dry conditions this winter is if not 100% wrong at least severely off predictions of moisture based on models.¬† As I type in late December, Bob (and all of NorCal) should be relieved that we are not out of our drought but having a very wet winter with heavy rain in lower altitudes and heavy snowfall in the Sierras.\nAnyone know what so radically changed the predicted outcome thus far?\nSubmitted by Paul on Tue, 12/21/2021 - 20:23\nIn reply to Second year La Nina by Bob\nThe large-scale atmospheric circulation has been pretty consistent with typical La Nina conditions so far, but the heavy precipitation in the northern half of California shows how important the details can be. I will note that the San Francisco Bay area is located between the driest La Nina signal in the Southwest and the wettest La Nina signal in the Pacific Northwest, so the tendency for dry conditions in central and northern California is not that strong, as reflected in the CPC's Winter Outlook. However, the very wet conditions tied to several atmospheric rivers are still atypical for La Nina. We will have to see how everything plays out the rest of this winter. As Mike's Winter Outlook post pointed out, there have been some La Nina winters that were wet in northern California (e.g., 1955-56 and 1995-96), so perhaps this will be another.\nSubmitted by Nathaniel.Johnson on Wed, 12/22/2021 - 16:08\nIn reply to So much for models by Paul\nIt is clear that someone at NOAA has the idea that they can't do anything about these horrible droughts caused by La Nina. I think they need to fix this immediately if not sooner. After all, the are the government and so have the power to do so.¬† There has to be some bright bulbs around there with some geo-engineering ideas to be put to good use. Spread the sulfur!\nSubmitted by JGS in Northern CA on Tue, 10/19/2021 - 13:41\nI know this is 2 weeks old, but is there a reason that some nino3.4 anomaly values differ so significantly. This site:\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/enso/indicators/sst/\nReports Nino3.4 anomaly for September to be -0.29. IRI also seems to Suggest values greater than -0.5?\nSubmitted by Cobus Olivier on Fri, 10/29/2021 - 07:07\nTom talked about the various sea surface temperature monitoring datasets in an earlier post. (The images will be restored soon--we're still upgrading old posts on our new climate.gov website.) They all have different inputs (the actual measurements), methods of going from single-point measurements to a regular grid, and even reporting periods--daily, weekly, or monthly. There are usually differences between the temperatures in the various datasets, and a difference of 0.2 degrees isn't unusual. We do pay close attention to the temperatures, though, and sometimes it becomes evident that one of them has an error. We think this is just the \"normal\" uncertainty in the data, but we'll keep an eye on it.\nSubmitted by Emily Becker on Wed, 11/03/2021 - 17:29\nIn reply to Different SST Anomaly Values for Nino3.4 by Cobus Olivier\nThe explanations for ocean changes seems to focus on above surface effects.¬† What about Pacific trench volcanic activity impacts on temperature and circulation?\nSubmitted by David John Fox on Tue, 11/16/2021 - 10:16\nFor the most part, the amount of heat transferred to the ocean from undersea volcanoes is very small relative to the heat exchange at the ocean surface, so the effects of these volcanoes on ocean temperature and circulation and on earth's climate are very small. However, that may not be true for very long timescales.\nSubmitted by Nathaniel.Johnson on Tue, 11/16/2021 - 10:55\nIn reply to Ocean temperature changes by David John Fox\nYears with a La Ni√±a tend lead to more frequent and unpredictable black ice in New England. It's quite clear in late fall as nights fall below freezing and days are above freezing- nobody salts the roads, so black ice forms nearly every night and melts by noon the next day instead of forming and immediately being salted during colder El Ni√±o years due to temps falling, consistently, below 0C, day and night. Not much science here, just how it is since the black ice is only an issue due to human elements and not due to a¬†meteorological issue.\nSubmitted by Alex on Mon, 11/22/2021 - 16:45\nInteresting observation, Alex! I'm not aware of any studies that investigate large-scale predictors of black ice (ENSO or otherwise), so it would be interesting if such connections could be solidified and quantified.\nSubmitted by Nathaniel.Johnson on Mon, 11/22/2021 - 16:57\nIn reply to La Ni√±a affects black ice frequency in New England by Alex\nWhat do you think the effects of this year's La Nina will be on Japan? Particularly in terms of snowfall? Last year's La Nina brought early, very heavy snow but abnormally mild temperatures in February, which is usually the coldest month.\nSubmitted by Huw on Wed, 12/01/2021 - 04:03\nHaving taken Meteorology courses at Penn State‚Ä¶.I can say this post is very well thought out and informative. ¬† Keep up the great work!\nSubmitted by Jacob Burgess on Tue, 12/07/2021 - 07:08",
