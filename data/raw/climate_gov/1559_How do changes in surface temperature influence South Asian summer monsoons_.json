Credit: NASA\nThe South Asian summer monsoon is one of the most important climate phenomena for summer in the Northern Hemisphere, influencing extreme weather and climate events particularly over Asia and impacting over one billion people’s lives. Decisions on climate change adaptation and policy for this heavily populated region will depend on future potential changes to the monsoon. To help inform decision making, a new study from an international group of Chinese and American researchers, funded in part by CPO’s Climate Variability and Predictability (CVP) program, quantifies how a change in global mean surface temperature will affect the South Asian summer monsoon, providing new insight into global warming’s impact. The study is available as an early online release in the Journal of Climate.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
