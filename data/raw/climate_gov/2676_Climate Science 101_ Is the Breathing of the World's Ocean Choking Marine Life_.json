  "content": "Running time 74:29\nIn this lecture, Chris Sabine describes current and future impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecology.\nDr. Christopher Sabine is the Director of NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, WA. His research addresses the role of the ocean in the global carbon cycle. His work centers on interpreting ocean inorganic carbon measurements and understanding ocean acidification. This includes understanding the air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide at the ocean surface, examining basin-scale distributions of both natural and human-emitted carbon in the ocean’s interior, evaluating ocean carbon cycle general circulation models with data-based global carbon distributions, and examining carbonate and organic matter re-mineralization within the open ocean and in coastal environments. Dr. Sabine holds a PhD in Oceanography from the University of Hawaii. He is an affiliate full professor in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Washington and a senior fellow in the university’s Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean.
