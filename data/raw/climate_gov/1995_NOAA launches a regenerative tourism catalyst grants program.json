Credit: Ocean Foundation\nNOAA’s Adaptation Sciences (AdSci) program is supporting a new catalytic grants program to enhance regenerative tourism is islands through a partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS), The Ocean Foundation, the Local2030 Islands Network and NOAA’s Marine Protected Areas (MPA) Center. Sustainable tourism focuses on minimizing the negative impacts of tourism for the benefit of future generations. Regenerative tourism seeks to leave the destination better than it was while improving the quality of life of the local community. It sees communities as living systems that are distinct, constantly interacting, evolving, and essential for creating balance and building resilience for improved well-being. At its core, the focus is on the needs and aspirations of the host communities. This approach is particularly important as countries and communities seek to combat the climate challenge and enhance their resilience. The request for project proposals went live on February 1, 2024 and are due June 30, 2024. A list of eligible countries can be found in the announcement. Islands include those across the Atlantic, Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nClick to read the full article",
