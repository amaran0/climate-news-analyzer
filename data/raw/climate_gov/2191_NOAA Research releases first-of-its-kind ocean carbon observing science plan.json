  "content": "The plan emphasizes the importance of coordinated research. Credit: NOAA\nOn January 16, 2025, NOAA Research released an Ocean Carbon Observing Science Plan. Ocean, coastal, and Great Lake carbon observations provide critical information that helps support the development of future climate projections, adaptation and mitigation strategies, and policies that inform decision makers and advance the Blue Economy. There is Â a critical need to observe and monitor our changing ocean, especially given increasing national and international carbon observing directives on global carbon cycle topics such as greenhouse gas monitoring, ocean acidification, and the emerging carbon dioxide removal field. This Science Plan aims to provide improved coordination and optimization of NOAA Research ocean carbon observing activities.\nClick to read the full article",
