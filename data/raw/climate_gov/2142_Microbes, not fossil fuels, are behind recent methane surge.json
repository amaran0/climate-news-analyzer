Credit: Pixabay\nA recent study by University of Colorado, Boulder researchers reveals that microbes, rather than fossil fuels, have been driving the surge in global methane emissions since 2020. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, traps significantly more heat than carbon dioxide, making its reduction critical for mitigating climate change. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlights that microbial sources, such as wetlands and livestock, now contribute over 90 percent of methane emissions. However, reducing fossil fuel emissions remains essential for addressing climate impacts.\nClick to read the full article",
