Places that were warmer than the long-term average (1980-2010) are shades of red, places that were cooler than average are blue, and places where temperatures were near average are white.\nWhen 2010 began, temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific were warmer than average (red), an indication that El Niño, the warm phase of a naturally occurring climate pattern known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), was underway.\nBy late spring, conditions were neutral, but the Pacific quickly switched to the cool phase of the ENSO pattern in summer. By July, La Niña was in place, and by the end of 2010, it had intensified into a moderate-to-strong event.\n___\nView this video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYi56r9AmEc&feature=youtu.be\n___\nLinks\nAnimation by Ned Gardiner. Maps by Dan Pisut, NOAA Environmental Visualization Lab, based on NOAA sea surface temperature data.\n___\nClimate Patterns & 2010 Temperatures: Near-record Warmth, Strong Natural Variability\nState of the Climate in 2010\nHelp us improve our content",
