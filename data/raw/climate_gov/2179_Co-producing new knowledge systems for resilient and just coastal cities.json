The authors explain that co-produced knowledge systems are “more inclusive, connective, and anticipatory than conventional city knowledge systems.” Through case studies based in Miami, San Juan, and Baltimore, communities were able to co-design a data visualization platform prototype that connects expertise, knowledge, and ideas that “helps take co-production towards envisioning systemic and long-term transformation based on building relationships of trust.”\nClick to read the full article",
