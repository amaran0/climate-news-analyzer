  "content": "Storm Data, a monthly publication, contains a chronological listing, by state, of storms and unusual weather phenomena. Reports contain information on storm paths, deaths, injuries, and property damage. Some issues of include an \"Outstanding storms of the month\" section that highlights severe weather events with photographs, illustrations, and narratives. Storm Data began in 1959 and is published with a single U.S. issue each month, several months after the feautured month. This enables editors to include late reports and corrections.\nMost of the information appearing in Storm Data comes from local NWS offices, but other sources such as the media, law enforcement and/or other government agencies, private companies, and individuals can also contribute. An effort is made to use the best available information, but because of time and resource constraints, information from these sources may be unverified by the NWS.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
