In a new study published in Geophysical Research Letters, researchers show that there has been a slight warming effect since these regulations were implemented, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, raising concerns that the changes in shipping practices might be inadvertently accelerating global warming.\nWhile reducing sulfur emissions is crucial for improving air quality and public health, it also eliminates the cooling effect that had been offsetting some of the warming caused by greenhouse gases\nClick to read the full article",
