Read about Climate Forcing »\n2.  Through experimentation, scientists have developed a solid understanding of the physical laws that control Earth's climate. Interactions of energy from the sun with the atmosphere, land, and ocean can be represented as equations: large computers solve the equations repeatedly to project the results of energy interactions into the future. Systems built to make these projections are called climate models.

Some portions of the Earth system respond to changes in the energy balance more quickly than others, but climate scientists feel confident that future climate will be increasingly different from that of today.
