Credit: Inciweb\nCPOâ€™s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program is announcing seven new three-year projects for Fiscal Years 2022-2024 that aim to develop new model-based monitoring products addressing key climate impact areas. The competitively-selected projects total $2.7M, including $2.7M in grants and $45K in other awards.\nThese projects are focused on developing new or experimental monitoring products that use modeling or model-adjacent approaches such as reanalysis, data assimilation, or artificial intelligence. The projects will provide new monitoring products relevant to high-priority climate risk areas around which the Climate Program Office is organizing some of its activities. These include extreme heat, hydroclimate and water resources with a focus on pluvial conditions, and coastal inundation.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
