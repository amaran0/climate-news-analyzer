Credit: NOAA\nAlong the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Coast, sea level naturally follows a seasonal cycle, typically lowest in winter and highest in late summer, driven by the ocean and atmosphere. Coastal communities in this area are experiencing more extreme sea level changes, which are increasing the risk of flooding, particularly during hurricane season. A new Geophysical Research Letters study finds these shifts are driven primarily by changing wind patterns. Authors Jiayan Yang and Ke Chen from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute show that over the past two decades, the lowest annual sea level has shifted later in the season, from January to February, while the highest sea level in September has risen by 82 percent.\nClick to read the full article",
