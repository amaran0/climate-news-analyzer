  "content": "During the third week of August 2011, daily temperatures were approximately 10 to 15°F higher than normal across portions of southern Europe and western Russia. For several consecutive days, people in these regions sweltered through daily highs that ranged from near 90 to over 100°F.\nThe map above shows the difference from average temperatures across Europe and western Russia for August 15-31. Red shading indicates temperatures up to 9°F above average while blue shading shows where temperatures were lower than average. Light colors indicate where temperatures were near the long-term average.\nAs temperatures rose in Bosnia, asphalt roads became soft and urban dwellers sought relief in rivers. According to the Belfast Telegraph, authorities across the region issued emergency heat alerts, urging people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water. They also recommended reducing work hours so that those who work outdoors could avoid the excessive heat.\nMap based on daily composites of temperature data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis project, provided by NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory.\nHelp us improve our content",
