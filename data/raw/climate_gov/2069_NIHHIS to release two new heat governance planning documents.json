Credit: NOAA\nThe National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) will soon publish two new documents to help local communities evaluate their successes in heat governance and identify challenges and areas for future improvement. These documents will help communities to become more resilient through addressing gaps in their current heat planning and response efforts.\nThe first document is an Introduction to Heat Tabletop Planning and Coordination resource that will help communities create and perform tabletop exercises that simulate emergency heat situations in an informal environment. Tabletop exercises can empower communities to evaluate their heat response plans, identify and remediate gaps, and consider heat events in the longer-term context of climate risk management and mitigation. The guide includes information that helps communities with planning, holding, and reporting tabletop exercises. It identifies materials communities will need and stakeholders and organizations that should be present for the exercise.\nClick to read the full article",
