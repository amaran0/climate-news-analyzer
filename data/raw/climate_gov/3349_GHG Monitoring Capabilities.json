The data is used to research GHG sources, quantify emissions by region and sector, and improve emission inventories for better decision-making.\nDownload the State of the Science Fact Sheet PDF\nGreenhouse gas measuring and monitoring platforms at NOAA.\nNOAA is a world-leading authority on measuring and monitoring greenhouse gases. For more than 50 years, NOAA has designed, deployed and maintained observational platforms that collect measurements on global, regional, and local scales. We collect measurements every day from a wide array of observing platforms (top left image) to advance scientific understanding of greenhouse gases’ sources and sinks (where they come from and where they end up).\nSociety’s ability to understand and address the root causes of global warming, and associated climatic changes, depends on the scientific evidence gathered by NOAA’s observing platforms. Likewise, NOAA GHG data are essential to understanding whether, where, and to what extent emission-reduction and carbon dioxide removal strategies are effective, today and into the future.\nLearn more at the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory\nRelated articles\nNOAA’s Global Monitoring Lab operates several carbon cycle monitoring programs. Icons on this global show where and what types of measurements are collected around the world.\nThis map shows the locations where measurements of carbon dioxide at the ocean’s surface have been made around the world for at least a decade. Red lines show the tracks of NOAA ships and uncrewed surface vehicles; gray lines show non-NOAA watercraft. Red squares show locations of NOAA's moored buoys; gray squares show non-NOAA buoys.
