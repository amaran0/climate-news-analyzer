Credit: NOAA\nWhen raindrops are cooler than the ground, rain has a cooling effect known as precipitation-induced sensible heat flux (QP). This effect is often left out of weather models, but a new study in Geographical Research Letters included QP in its simulations of the summer monsoon season in India. The researchers found that during these heavy rains, QP can lead to a reduction in overall rainfall and affects how rain is distributed across the region. These impacts could have important consequences for agriculture and irrigation practices.\nClick to read the full article",
