In the last decade, 90% of American counties have been impacted by weather disasters. NOAA Research’s data, tools, and expertise enables everyone to have the knowledge and ability to be safer, healthier and proactively mitigate the worst impacts of extreme weather events.\nAs hurricanes continued to unleash their deadly and destructive forces in 2024, NOAA’s critical science and services are needed more than ever by communities, decision makers and emergency planners. Over the past three decades, NOAA hurricane scientists have been improving hurricane forecasting through innovative research, new technologies, and by creating advanced modeling systems. The newest advancement for hurricane research is the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), a model that brings together ocean and atmospheric observations allowing scientists to see multiple storms at once to understand how they interact.\nClick to read the full article",
