And, when readily available technologies such as the cell phone in your pocket can serve as a data collection tool, there’s never been a better time for the public to participate in environmental monitoring—or even start a project of their own.\nTo support such efforts, CPO's Coastal Inundation Risk Team compiled an inventory of Citizen Science projects to track coastal change. This inventory, paired with a form to collect information on additional projects, is now available on a WHOI Sea Grant website, Communities Tracking Coastal Change. \nPeople who are interested in tracking local coastal change can search for existing projects on a map. Those who want to start a new project can explore descriptions of \"science platforms\" that can help people make and share coastal observations.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
