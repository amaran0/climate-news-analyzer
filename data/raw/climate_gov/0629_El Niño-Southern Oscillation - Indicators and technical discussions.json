  "content": "This webpage from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center provides current information related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), including technical information for forecasting impacts in the United States.\nFor less-technical articles about ENSO, see Climate.gov's El Niño & La Niña (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) page, including the monthly ENSO Blog.\nMeasurements of Sea Surface Temperature come from instruments on NOAA operational satellites, ships, buoys, and maps of sea ice. Wind and pressure information is from the Climate Data Assimilation System, a set of computer algorithms used to analyze observed air pressure patterns to understand conditions at various levels of the atmosphere. Discussions and weekly update presentations on the site are contributed by meteorologists.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nFor the most recent information, see the Weekly ENSO Evolution, Status, and Prediction report\nHelp us improve our content",
