  "content": "A color-coded map indicates current river levels or flood stages for more than 6,500 streamgages in U.S. states and territories. Zoom to a region of interest and hover over any dot to generate a hydrograph of recently observed water levels at that site. Some sites also offer water level forecasts for the next several days.\nThe majority of water level observations come from the U.S. Geological Survey's national network of streamgages. Some real-time water level information comes from other federal, state, and local streamgage networks.\nNOAA River Forecast Centers issue forecasts for some streams and rivers. Experts at these centers take into account how much precipitation has fallen in the recent past and precipitation amounts anticipated in the next 24 hours.\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
