Credit: NOAA\nOn Tuesday, November 28, the White House released a coordinated national strategy, “The National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring and Information Service” (or GHGMMIS), to measure, monitor, and share greenhouse gas information. The new strategy aims to enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) data and information to accelerate progress towards President Biden’s emissions reduction goals and inform mitigation efforts. The plan builds on a body of work across NOAA Research laboratories as well as NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), augmented by GHG research and engagement efforts supported by the Climate Program Office (CPO).\nA number of CPO’s GHG past and current priorities support the National Strategy. CPO’s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) Program has supported over thirty projects since 2013 that contribute to the science of each of the five objectives laid out in the National Strategy. For example, recent AC4-funded projects have studied emissions impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as urban emissions.\nClick to read the full article",
