The average temperature was 1.71°F (0.95°C) above the twentieth-century average. It was the second-warmest year in the historical record dating back to 1880, and the amount of heat energy stored in the top 2,000 meters of the ocean was the highest on record.\nThe animated gif at right shows how temperatures throughout 2019 compared to the 1981-2010 average, showing each month from January–December and ending with the 2019 annual average. Places that were warmer than average are shades of red, and places that were cooler than average are blue. The monthly range of variability is larger than the annual range, so the monthly maps are scaled from -9 to +9 degrees Fahrenheit, while the annual map is scaled from - 5 to +5 Fahrenheit.\nThe contrasts between unusually warm and unusually cool areas are larger over land than ocean, and they shift around more from month to month. Parts of Alaska, southern Africa, central Europe, and Australia experienced their warmest year on record, but no areas experienced their coldest year.  In fact, the only land area worldwide where temperatures averaged over the year were cooler than average was a small pocket of the northern United States.\nRead more highlights on 2019 temperature, precipitation, and snow and ice conditions from NOAA's National Center for Environmental Information here.\nHelp us improve our content",
