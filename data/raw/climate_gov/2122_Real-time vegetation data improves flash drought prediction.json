Credit: Pixabay\nA new study in Journal of Hydrometeorology explored how accurately modeling vegetation can improve flash drought predictions. The researchers found that integrating real-time satellite data on vegetation into models offers more accuracy than older models that rely on less timely or less accurate plant data. Compared to models that use predicted plant growth, models that incorporate satellite measurements of plant cover improve tracking of drought duration. This model improvement is crucial for agriculture, as better prediction can help farmers protect their crops and manage water resources more efficiently.\nClick to read the full article",
