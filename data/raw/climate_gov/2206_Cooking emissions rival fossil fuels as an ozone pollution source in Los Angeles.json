Credit: NOAA\nAs the adoption of cleaner-burning engines and electric vehicles drives fossil fuel emissions lower, scientists have discovered that a surprising pollution source is playing a significant role in cooking up ozone in the air over Los Angeles.\nAccording to new research from NOAA, the potent and often pungent volatile organic compounds (VOCs) given off from cooking food are now responsible for over a quarter of the ozone production from VOCs generated by human activity in the LA basin. This is roughly equal to the amount of ozone produced by VOCs from on-road and off-road motor vehicles.\nThe new study, published in Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics, takes a more complete look at the mix of VOCs in urban air by adding chemical compounds specific to cooking emissions to an air quality model set up to replicate the conditions in and around Los Angeles\nClick to read the full article",
