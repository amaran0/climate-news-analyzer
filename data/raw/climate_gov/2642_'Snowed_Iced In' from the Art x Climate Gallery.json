The gallery collection features the work of 92 artists, selected from more than 800 submissions. This watercolor collage may only be reproduced or re-used in connection with the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Any other use must be negotiated with the author.\nClimate-change risks easily bring to mind events such as heatwaves, droughts, and occasional downpours of heavy rain. A warmer climate could also have a paradoxical effect. At least in the short term, warming conditions could mean more snow, not less...\nAs NCA5’s Midwest chapter explains, climate risks to the Great Lakes basins range from increased erosion to harmful algal blooms. Another impact could include an increase in lake-effect snow. When the Great Lakes remain ice-free and cold air continues to flow over them, the cold air captures moisture from the lakes. The cold air can then form clouds and ultimately snow. The longer the lakes remain ice-free in winter, the more lake-effect snow may fall.\nNikki Way produced this watercolor collage in 2021. This is Way’s statement:\nThe Great Lakes region is considered a future refuge area against the extreme heat to come. However, there is much uncertainty about the future of our weather. Climate change may bring more intense lake effect snow and ice storms, even as snow and ice cover decrease overall. Our homes, ecosystems, and economies are at risk and we need to be more prepared. Water levels are already sweeping away houses, mangling infrastructure, and disrupting Indigenous traditions. This piece reflects my fear and uncertainty around climate change in the Great Lakes region.\nHelp us improve our content",
