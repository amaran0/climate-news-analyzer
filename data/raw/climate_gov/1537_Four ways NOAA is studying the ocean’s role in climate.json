Even with decades of scientific research, more than 80 percent of the ocean remains unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored, which is a lot considering that more than 70 percent of the globe is covered by the ocean. NOAA’s Global Ocean Monitoring and Observing Program (GOMO) has the distinct mission of supporting ocean observations to improve our understanding of the ocean’s role in environmental change, which is becoming increasingly important as we study climate change.\nThrough research supported by GOMO and other parts of NOAA, we have made important strides in our understanding of trends in ocean heat storage, carbon dioxide uptake, the Earth’s energy imbalance and more. NOAA supports a suite of ocean observing and monitoring tools (also called instruments or platforms) that make this research possible. Learn about four of these ocean observing tools below. Maybe you have already seen some in the ocean!\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
