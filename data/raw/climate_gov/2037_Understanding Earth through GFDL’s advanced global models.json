Credit: NOAA\nIn celebration of Earth Month, GFDL shares how the lab is investing to meet weather and climate goals through some of its advanced global models: CM4, SPEAR, ESM4, and SHiELD. These realistic models play an important role in enhancing our comprehension of the Earth system, each providing unique insights into the science underpinning our understanding and enabling predictions and projections.\nCM4 (Climate Model version 4) is a comprehensive climate model that encompasses advanced representations of atmospheric, oceanic, ice, and land processes. CM4 is skillful at simulating diverse climate conditions across time — from historical climates to present variability and future projections. The model’s complexity and high resolution allows for deep insights into climate dynamics and the interactions driving global climate changes, which helps in developing effective climate response strategies and solutions.\nClick to read the full article",
