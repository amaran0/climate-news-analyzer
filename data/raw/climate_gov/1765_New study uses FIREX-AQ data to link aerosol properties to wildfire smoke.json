Credit: NASA\nAtmospheric aerosols are effective at scattering light and causing reduced visibility, and the extent to which this process occurs can be linked to overall aerosol concentrations and human health impacts. Measurements taken during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign provide a record of this aerosol light scattering during the 2019 wildfire season in the western U.S.\nThe FIREX-AQ project was a partnership between NOAA and NASA, funded in part by CPOâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) Program.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
