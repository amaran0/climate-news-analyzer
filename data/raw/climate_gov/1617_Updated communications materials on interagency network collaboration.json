Three federal climate science-to-action networks collaborate closely to ensure relevant scientific information and adaptive management strategies are available to address stakeholder-identified needs. These networks are the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Climate Hubs, the U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment Program (RISA). These networks have a shared goal of building national resilience to climate change by offering long-term and engaged support with localized scientific expertise and tailored solutions. All three networks rely on partnerships within their regions, which include scientists, practitioners, and local decision makers, to identify regional vulnerabilities, scientific needs and data, and methods for mitigating impacts and adapting to changing conditions.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
