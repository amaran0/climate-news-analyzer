Credit: NOAA Climate.gov\nHow can we improve our ability to predict precipitation variability and extremes? To answer this question, CPOâ€™s Earth System Science and Modeling (ESSM) Division and the DOE Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division (EESSD), in partnership with USGCRP and the U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program (US CLIVAR), jointly organized a community workshop in late 2020 focused on advancing understanding of precipitation predictability and exploring ways to reduce precipitation biases. The NOAA-DOE Precipitation Processes and Predictability workshop report is now available.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
