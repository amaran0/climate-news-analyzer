  "date": null,
  "content": "Released in 2023, the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) includes an Art × Climate gallery intended to engage the public with climate in a new way. The gallery collection features the work of 92 artists, selected from more than 800 submissions. This work may only be reproduced or re-used in connection with the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Any other use must be negotiated with the author.\nMultiple factors drive droughts, such as high water demand and low precipitation. Higher temperatures can also drive drought development and intensification, by driving increased atmospheric demand for moisture.\nNCA5’s Water chapter describes how drought stresses terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Consequences might include higher water temperature and salinity, fewer nutrients, lower oxygen levels, concentrated contaminants, loss of surface and groundwater connections, and declining productivity. Drought can exacerbate other disturbances such as pests and wildfires. Ecosystems that are resilient under normal climate variability may not recover from drought in a changed climate.\nMeredith Nemirov made this image in 2022 with acrylic on a historic topographic map. This is the artist's statement:\nRivers Feed the Trees is a series of works on historic maps where blue is painted into the topography to create an abundance of rivers and streams. Since the turn of the 21st century, Colorado has experienced periods of extreme drought. This inspired me to create works where I imagine a CO with no drought. I hope these images will encourage people to learn more about where our water comes from and to look for solutions to the dire situation we are facing regarding the future of our water.\nHelp us improve our content",
