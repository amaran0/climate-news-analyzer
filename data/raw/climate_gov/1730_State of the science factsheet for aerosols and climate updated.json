Credit: NOAA\nCPO's Monika Kopacz, Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, & Climate (AC4) program manager, brought together subject matter experts from across NOAA to update the NOAA State of the Science Factsheet for Aerosols and Climate.\nAerosols—microscopic solid or liquid particles suspended in air—significantly affect the Earth’s weather, air quality, and climate. The uncertainties associated with aerosol climate effects are much larger than those of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Improving our understanding of the role of aerosols in the Earth System is essential for providing more accurate weather forecasts and reliable climate projections as well as information needed for future climate adaptation and mitigation.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
