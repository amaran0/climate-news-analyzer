Credit: doi:10.1038/s41597-024-03530-7\nResearchers from NOAA have produced a new online dashboard on the National Marine Ecosystem Status website that shows how ocean acidification is impacting eleven different marine ecosystems in the U.S.\nThese graphs, charts and mapped products, which were also described in a recent paper for Nature Scientific Data, provide a resource to fisheries and natural resource managers and deliver simple snapshots of ecosystem status with respect to ocean acidification.\n“The dashboard provides regional context for anyone who wants to know how ocean acidification is progressing in U.S. coastal ecosystems,” said Dr. Jon Sharp, who led the work.\nClick to read the full article",
