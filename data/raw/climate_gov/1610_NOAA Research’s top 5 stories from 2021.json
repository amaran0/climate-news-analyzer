As the year draws to a close, we’re taking a look back at a few of our biggest research stories of the last 12 months.\n2021 was a big year for climate records. In May, carbon dioxide measured at NOAA’s Mauna Loa Atmospheric Baseline Observatory peaked for 2021 at a monthly average of 419 parts per million (ppm). That’s the highest level since accurate measurements began 63 years ago, according to NOAA and Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientists. NOAA’s Mauna Loa Observatory is critical for tracking carbon dioxide - it’s a remote location with little vegetation and human activity, so it represents a good baseline for atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
