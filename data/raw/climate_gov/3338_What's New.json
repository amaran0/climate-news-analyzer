  "content": "This latest version of Climate.gov (Climate.gov Version 3.0, launched in October 2021) reflects changes to keep up with web technology trends as well as improvements to respond to formal and informal feedback from users. We've implemented the U.S. Web Design Standards from Digital.gov, and we've made the site fully responsive on mobile devices. We've added a more comprehensive universal navigation bar.\nIn addition, we're launching a customized search algorithm that suggests related content from across the site and offers multiple options for filtering and sorting search results to make it easier to find exactly what you want. Importantly, this new search tool integrates content from Climate.gov and the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit, allowing users to easily find related content from both sites.\nAsk us for help.\nNOAA Climate.gov has been redesigned in response to user feedback and external assessment.Â If you have comments or suggestions about the new design, let us know. We're already looking ahead to our next round of improvements, and we welcome your input.",
