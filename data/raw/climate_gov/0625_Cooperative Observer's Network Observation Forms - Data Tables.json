Daily observations are provided as digital scans of handwritten records or computer-generated forms. COOP data usually consist of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, snowfall, and 24-hour precipitation totals.\nVolunteer Cooperative Weather Observers measure weather every day at National Parks, seashores, mountaintops, and farms as well as in urban and suburban areas. There are several different types of instrumentation used by COOP Observers to keep track of the weather: the instruments are identical at all stations across the country.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nCOOP Observer's Resources - Forms, training materials, and other information\nHelp us improve our content",
