  "content": "Simple graphs of U.S. Climate Normals for temperature and precipitation are one way to show a location's climate through the year, month, or day. Climate Normals reflect a weather station's previous three decades of observed weather.\nWeather stations around the country provide observational data over many decades. Measurements collected over 30 years—the most recent three full decades—are averaged to produce Climate Normals. Climate Normals are calculated using the best available data, which means removing missing or questionable data points. Climate Normals are updated every ten years: the currently used Normals are from 1991 - 2020.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nFor locations in the U.S. check climographs to understand a location's average climate from the last three decades.\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
