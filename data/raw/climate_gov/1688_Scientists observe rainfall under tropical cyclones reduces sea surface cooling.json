A recent study by researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory found that large amounts of rain under tropical cyclones can reduce the sea surface cooling induced by them.\nWhen the strong winds of a tropical cyclone move over the ocean, mixing and upwelling bring colder, deeper water up to the surface layer, resulting in a cooling of the sea surface temperature. This is the ocean’s primary response to a hurricane, and it acts as a negative feedback on the storm’s intensity, because the cooler the ocean is, the harder it is for the liquid water to become vapor and fuel the storm’s clouds.\nUsing a variety of observations, high-resolution climate model simulations, and numerical experiments with an ocean mixed layer model, scientists demonstrate that rainfall under weak tropical cyclones can significantly reduce the magnitude of cold wakes induced by them. Less sea surface cooling allows tropical cyclones to better maintain their strength and even intensify.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
