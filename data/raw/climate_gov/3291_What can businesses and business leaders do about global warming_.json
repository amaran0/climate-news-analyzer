  "date": null,
  "content": "Business leaders can evolve their business models to pursue \"win-win\" strategies that allow them to stay profitable while improving their energy efficiency, reducing their carbon emissions, and reducing their, and their customers', risks to climate-related impacts. Businesses can offer low-carbon-emitting products and services to customers who are seeking them. They can consider making low-carbon products and services the default where consumers have a range of choices. Also, businesses that make \"climate-smart\" choices in their offices and operations can let their customers know about it. These and other climate choices are summarized in two 2010 reports by the National Academy of Sciences, titled Informing an Effective Response to Climate Change and Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change.\nOne of the largest airports in the United States, Denver International Airport has a multi-pronged approach to energy efficiency: light roofs and runways to reflect rather than absorb heat, strategically placed windows to take advantage of sunlight, solar panels, and a commuter train.
