Credit: NASA Worldview\nSmoke from fires has large air quality, health, and climate impacts. However, both the quantity of smoke and its ability to warm or cool the atmosphere remain poorly understood. By looking at differences in smoke emissions and how smoke absorbs sunlight, a new study supported by CPOâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, & Climate (AC4) program provides a better understanding of the air quality and climate effects of fires in the western United States and southern Africa. The study is led by MIT and published in JGR Atmospheres as an early online release.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
