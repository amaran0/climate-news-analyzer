Randy Osborne of Louisiana State University and Tim Osborn of NOAA’s Office of Coastal Survey explain how a constellation of global positioning system (GPS) satellites in space provides a stable platform for measuring both.\nTranscript\nRandy Osborne, Louisiana State University\nThis is the LSU Real-Time Network. The Real-Time Network is a series of stations that monitor GPS positions every second. Each one of these stations talks back to our network here at LSU, and we are able to take all that information and create a network solution for end users to get positions in real-time that are as accurate as if they were standing on top of the base station.\nTim Osborn, NOAA Office of Coast Survey\nWhen you can have local surveying and engineering professionals actually develop that information in real time and actually can themselves prove that sea level rise and subsidence is actually occurring, then it really shortcuts, it really is the timesaver of having us come and try to make people believe us as outsiders that they are experiencing these problems.\nNow you have the companies right here with the resources to go out literally within the space of just a few minutes and actually show any decision-maker what is happening and compare it to what was designed and built here 30 or 40 years ago and why it doesn’t work and why action needs to be taken.\nGPS Engineer\nElevation of water is .513.\n__\nLinks\nRead the full-length feature story: Thriving on a Sinking Landscape\nHelp us improve our content",
