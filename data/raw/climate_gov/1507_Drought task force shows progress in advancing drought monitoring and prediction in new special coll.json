  "title": "Drought task force shows progress in advancing drought monitoring and prediction in new special collection",
  "date": null,
  "content": "In a special AMS collection, 13 papers produced by researchers from the third CPO Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) program Drought Task Force (DTF3) describe research advances leading to improved monitoring, prediction, and understanding of past droughts.\nThe advances represent outcomes from research funded by the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) and MAPP programs, leveraging other U.S. agencies’ investments, and coordinated within the framework of DTF3.\nThe collection includes an introductory paper that motivates the research and highlights some recent advances in drought monitoring and prediction systems. Other papers include “Drought Variability over the Conterminous United States for the Past Century”, “Prediction of Flash Droughts over the United States”, and “Prediction Skill of the 2012 U.S. Great Plains Flash Drought in Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) Models.”\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
