Credit: NOAA\nThe Global Drifter Program at AOML has a new ERDDAP, or Environmental Research Division Data Access Program, server that is now publicly available and hosts both hourly and 6-hour quality-controlled interpolated drifter datasets. This new scientific data server uses free and open-source software created by the Environmental Research Division of NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center.\nERDDAP provides a simple, consistent way to download drifter data in common file formats, resulting in easier access to data for the scientific community.
