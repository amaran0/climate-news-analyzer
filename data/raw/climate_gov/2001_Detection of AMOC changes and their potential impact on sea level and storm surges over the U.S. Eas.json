Credit: South Carolina National Guard\nLiping Zhang and Hiroyuki Murakami, scientists at GFDL, have been awarded funding for a new climate projections project that will spotlight the critical issue of extreme sea level events along the U.S. East Coast, emphasizing their societal impact. These events, often fueled by storm surges during extreme weather occurrences, substantially threaten lives and infrastructure in coastal regions.\nThis study zeroes in on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as a key player in influencing mean sea level variations and weather events. By employing a comprehensive approach that incorporates observations, sophisticated simulations, and extensive datasets, the researchers aim to discern the intricate links between AMOC, sea level changes, and weather patterns, particularly on decadal timescales. The ultimate goal is to develop predictive capabilities for sea level changes, offering insights that can inform strategies to mitigate the impact of these events on the U.S. East Coast.\nClick to read the full article",
