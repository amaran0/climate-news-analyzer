Credit: TEPEX\nThis week, scientists released the TEPEX Science Plan, a blueprint for implementing the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) Equatorial Pacific Experiment (TEPEX). TEPEX is an international effort to improve the understanding and prediction of processes in the tropical Pacific. The TEPEX Science Plan describes the projectâ€™s scientific motivation, background, and goals, underscoring the importance of the project to better understand processes that are central to global weather and climate. The project will use both field observations and modeling studies to achieve its objectives.\nClick to read the full article",
