Researchers from the University of Houston, Rice University, and NOAA/Global Systems Laboratory used 15-years of surface ozone observations and weekly US Drought Monitor indices to investigate the differences in ozone response to drought across the US and determine what role ozone chemistry plays in causing such differences. They found an increase in summertime ozone in the US southeast during drought conditions, but no change or even a decrease in the US west. By modeling the ozone chemistry at the different observation sites, the research team was able to determine that isoprene, a key precursor of ozone, drove the opposite responses.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
