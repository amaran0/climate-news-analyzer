Credit: Wikipedia\nThe EPA National Emissions Inventory shows U.S. anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions—an air pollutant that can cause severe health and environmental consequences—have declined from 2005–2019. However, satellite data from NASA’s OMI satellite shows a decreasing trend in NOx emissions until 2009 and then a flat trend after that. A new study supported in part by CPO’s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, & Climate (AC4) program helps explain this disagreement between emission inventories and satellite data. The study is published as an early access article in Environmental Research Letters.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
