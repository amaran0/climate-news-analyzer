Credit: Pixabay\nThe ability to accurately predict precipitation events depends on how much data has been collected and analyzed. Therefore, it is imperative for climate scientists to have up-to-date datasets to further research on current and future precipitation events. Aligning with the objectives from NOAA’s Precipitation Prediction Grand Challenge Strategy (PPGC), CPO’s Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) program selected 2 projects that will provide usable and useful datasets that further enable monitoring and modeling efforts.\nEach project will expand and improve current, existing precipitation analysis datasets. Additionally, each project will focus on a different aspect of how to further the use of observations for data assimilation and precipitation prediction.\nClick to read the full article",
