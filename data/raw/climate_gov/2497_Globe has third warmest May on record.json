  "content": "NOAA's monthly climate report for May 2017 was released last week, and according to records dating back to 1880, it was the third warmest May on record. The map at right shows global average surface temperature for May compared to the 1981-2010 average. Places that were warmer than average are colored in shades of red, and places that were cooler than average are in shades of blue. Places with no data for the month are colored gray. Below the map is a time series of temperatures each May from 1880-2017 compared to the twentieth-century average (1901-2000). The solid gray line shows the long-term trend, which is 0.13°F (0.07°C) per decade.\nHighlights from the May global climate report include:\nFor more details and maps on regional temperature, precipitation, snow and ice, and other climate conditions,  see the full May 2017 Global Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. For a recap of U.S. climate conditions in May, view the May 2017 National Climate Report.\nThe map above comes from Climate.gov Data Snapshots map collection. It is based on the official NOAA global temperature product, but uses a little more interpolation to estimate temperatures in areas with missing data. The data for the graph came from NCEI's Climate at a Glance web analysis tool.\nHelp us improve our content",
