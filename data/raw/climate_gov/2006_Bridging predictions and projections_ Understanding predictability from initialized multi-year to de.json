Credit: Pixabay\nEmily Becker, a scientist at the University of Miami, has been awarded funding for their role as a co-PI in the climate projections project, “Bridging Predictions and Projections: Understanding Predictability from Initialized Multi-Year to Decadal Predictions for High-Impact Climate Futures.”\nBecker will support this scientific study, led by Kathleen Pegion of the University of Oklahoma, investigating the connections between North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variability and high-impact climate events in the Eastern and Central US during summer. The team will test the hypothesis that the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) plays a crucial role in predicting extreme weather phenomena like heatwaves, extreme precipitation, drought, and coastal inundation on multi-year to decadal timescales.\nClick to read the full article",
