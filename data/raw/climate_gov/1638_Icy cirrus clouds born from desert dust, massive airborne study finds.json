Credit: NASA\nEvery year, several billion metric tonnes of mineral dust are lofted into the atmosphere from the worldâ€™s arid regions, making dust one of the most abundant types of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Now, scientists are learning that tiny bits of dust from the hottest and driest parts of the Earth are a surprisingly large driver in forming the delicate, wispy ice clouds known as cirrus in the cold, high-altitudes of the atmosphere.\nWhile scientists have known that desert dust particles seed clouds, the extent of that relationship has been a long-standing question. New research, based on the largest-ever airborne atmospheric sampling mission and published this month in Nature Geoscience, sheds light on the role of dust in the climate system.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
