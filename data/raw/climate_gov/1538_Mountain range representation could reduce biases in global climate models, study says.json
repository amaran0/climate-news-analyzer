Credit: NOAA Climate Program Office\nFor years, global climate models have shown biases in their representation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a tropical rainband where a large portion of Earthâ€™s precipitation occurs. However, researchers from a recent Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM)- and Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP)-funded study argue that a significant portion of tropical rainfall and circulation biases in global climate models are due to how mountain ranges are represented in these models.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
