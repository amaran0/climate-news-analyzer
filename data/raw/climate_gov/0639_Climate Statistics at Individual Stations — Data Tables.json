  "content": "This site provides data tables for comparing record-setting conditions and Climate Normals at major U.S. weather observing stations in the United States. The data are not intended for the analysis of climate variability and change; they are most useful for comparing general climate conditions of between locations.\nData reflect measurements made by automated ground-based weather stations in major cities across the country. Only those stations that have accrued at least three years of data are included. Monthly and annual climatic statistics were computed from period of record data in the National Centers for Environmental Information’s (NCEI) Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily data set.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nCompare normal and extreme conditions observed at a range of individual weather stations.\nHow do I use the site?\nStart at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/comparative-clima…\nUnder Related Content, click links under Observed Data and Climate Normals to view data tables comparing the indicated variable for the list of stations (listed in alphabetical order by state).\nHelp us improve our content",
