Credit: doi:10.1038/s41467-023-40849-y\nMarine heatwaves disturb marine communities, setting off a chain of impacts to the environment as well as coastal communities and economies. No two marine heatwaves are the same, yet research has not developed reliable prediction tools showing how different lengths and intensities of these events will affect ocean species. A new study supported by the Climate Program Office (CPO) demonstrates just how complex those impacts are, using modeling techniques and observations focused on fourteen different species in the Northeastern Pacific. This work was funded by a collaborative grant from CPOâ€™s Climate Observations and Monitoring (COM) Program, Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP), and Climate and Fisheries Adaptation (CAFA) programs aiming to improve climate understanding and information for marine sanctuary management planning.\nClick to read the full article",
