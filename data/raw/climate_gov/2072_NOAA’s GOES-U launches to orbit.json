Credit: NASA/NOAA\nThe successful GOES-U satellite launch this week marks a significant milestone in weather observation and environmental monitoring. GOES-U is the latest addition to NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system, renowned for providing critical data that enhances weather forecasting, severe storm tracking, and climate research. GOES-U, the fourth and final satellite in the GOES-R series, will continue the legacy of its predecessors by delivering high-resolution imagery and atmospheric measurements.\nLooking ahead, NOAA is preparing for the launch of the Geostationary Extended Observations (GeoXO) program. NOAA Climate Program Office staff from the Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) Program and Earth’s Radiation Budget (ERB) Program are involved in this ground-breaking mission. GeoXO is set to revolutionize weather monitoring and environmental data collection even further, with enhanced capabilities designed to address the growing needs of weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and disaster response.\nClick to read the full article",
