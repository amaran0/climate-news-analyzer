Wildfire smoke includes airborne particles that can act as nuclei for forming individual droplets in clouds. A team of researchers, funded in part by CPOâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, and Climate (AC4) program, recently published a study in Geophysical Research Letters showing how these smoke-influenced clouds differ from their clean air counterparts, with complex implications for our weather and climate. They found that clouds were strongly influenced by smoke across the western United States, forming with more, smaller droplets.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
