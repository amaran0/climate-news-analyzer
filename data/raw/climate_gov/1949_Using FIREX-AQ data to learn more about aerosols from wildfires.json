Credit: NOAA\nA new study supported by the Climate Program Officeâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle and Climate (AC4) Program takes a close look at organic aerosols emitted from wildfires and how they impact surrounding regions. A research team, including AC4-funded researchers Vanessa Selimovic and Robert Yokelson of the University of Montana, present and analyze measurements from the joint NOAA- and NASA-led FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality 2019) field campaigns. Some of these measurements were taken by another AC4-funded scientist Delphine Farmer of Colorado State University. This work contributes to an AC4 initiative to use FIREX-AQ data to understand and predict the impact of North American fires on the atmosphere and to support better land management to help prevent them from occurring.\nClick to read the full article",
