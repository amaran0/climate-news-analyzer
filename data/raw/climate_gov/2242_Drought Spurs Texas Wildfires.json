Since the beginning of wildfire season in fall 2010, Texas has seen 16,368 fires and close to 3.5 million acres (14,163.99 square kilometers) have burned. For many, Independence Day fireworks were out of the question because of fire bans.\nAnd yet it might have been worse. Back in November 2010, NOAA issued a long-range forecast warning of the likelihood of extreme drought conditions that would lead to a high fire risk. The advance notice of the wildfire threat allowed state fire managers in Texas and the surrounding states enough time to assess their fire risk, assets, and resources.\nThe photo above shows the view from an aircraft carrying fire retardant as it follows a U.S. Department of Agriculture plane serving as a guide. Deployed in Scurry County, Texas, in April 2011, the planes work in tandem to ensure that fire retardant is dropped precisely where it is needed.\nFor more on dry conditions in summer 2011, see Drought in the Southern United States.\nRelated Links:\nState of the Climate | National Overview | July 2011\nOffice of the Texas State Climatologist\nNOAA Plays Role in Helping Texans Prepare and Respond to Wildfires\nHelp us improve our content",
