Credit: NOAA\nEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climate pattern that involves changes in sea surface temperatures (SST). Although centered around the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, associated variations in SSTs can be found in other parts of the world.\nA recent study, partially funded by the Climate Program Office’s Climate Variability & Predictability (CVP) Program, presents a new framework to analyze these teleconnections. CVP-funded researcher Ping Chang from Texas A&M University, alongside researchers from Japan Agency for Marine‐Earth Science and Technology, and The University of Tokyo, used a linear inverse modeling method, to assess how interactions between the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins affect the predictability of sea surface temperature in the tropics.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
