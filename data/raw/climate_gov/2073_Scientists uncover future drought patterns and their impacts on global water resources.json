Credit: Pixabay\nUsing advanced climate models, a new study in Earth’s Future found that the duration and severity of droughts are expected to increase globally from 2015 to 2100. The researchers applied a “storyline” approach, examining trends in runoff, the timing of seasonal droughts, and the frequency of multi-year droughts under different emissions scenarios to create detailed narratives of potential future drought conditions. The results show that about one-third of the world’s land could see more frequent multi-year droughts under a low-emission scenario, while 62 percent of land area could face more frequent and severe droughts under the highest-emission scenario.\nClick to read the full article",
