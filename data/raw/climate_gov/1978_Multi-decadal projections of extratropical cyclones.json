Credit: NOAA\nRachel McCrary, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), has been awarded funding for their climate projections project, “Multi-decadal projections of extratropical cyclones and their associated extreme precipitation, snowfall, and surface winds.\nIn winter, powerful storms called Extratropical Cyclones (ETCs) bring risky weather, causing heavy rain, snow, and strong winds. These events result in significant harm to people and property, contributing to costly disasters in the U.S. To help communities prepare for these storms, this research will employ advanced climate models to predict how ETCs and their extreme effects might change in the future. Lead Investigator Rachel McCrary, together with Co-Investigators Melissa Bukovsky (NCAR), Mari Tye (NCAR), Colin Zarzycki (Pennsylvania State University), and Benjamin Moore (NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory), will explore important questions about these storms and work closely with members of the American Society of Civil Engineers to develop plans that consider climate change, ultimately improving our ability to handle and adapt to climate-related challenges. The researchers will also fully examine the ability of NOAA’s Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research (SPEAR) to study ETCs and provide recommendations for model development and improvement.\nClick to read the full article",
