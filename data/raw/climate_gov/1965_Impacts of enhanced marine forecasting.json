Credit: NOAA\nA new story from NOAA Fisheries highlights enhanced forecasting that can anticipate changing ocean conditions up to a year in advance. The story described two studies supported by the Climate Program Officeâ€™s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program that were recently published in Nature Communications and PLOS Climate. MAPP-funded scientist Michael Jacox worked with research teams from the University of California Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries to examine ocean forecasts and help make them more useful to marine resource managers and decision-makers. These studies contribute to a growing body of work supporting a MAPP initiative to explore seasonal prediction of coastal high water levels and changing living marine resources.\nClick to read the full article",
