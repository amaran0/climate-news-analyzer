Ten communities have received a total of $200,000 for developing manuals for extreme heat response planning, and $500,000 in funding will go to Duke Universityâ€™s Heat Policy Innovation Hub for heat policy research and outreach.\nTen communities have each received a $20,000 prize for the Heat Tabletop Exercise Planning Challenge. The communities developed manuals outlining plans to run heat tabletop exercises that test local emergency heat response efforts through simulated scenarios. The exercises aim to bring state, local and tribal governments and community organizations together to determine how they can better collaborate during heat events, and assess their current heat action plans. Communities that received prizes excelled at identifying realistic scenarios, representing their whole community, showcasing creativity and maintaining high attention to detail.\nClick to read the full article",
