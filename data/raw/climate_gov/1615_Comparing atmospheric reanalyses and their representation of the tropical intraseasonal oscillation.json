Credit: NOAA\nNew research, supported by CPO’s Climate Variability & Predictability (CVP) program, identifies which reanalysis products may be the most useful for better studying and simulating the tropical intraseasonal oscillation (ISO).\nThe ISO dominates subseasonal variability over the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans and influences tropical cyclones, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and Asian-Austrailian monsoons. Earth system models struggle to accurately simulate the ISO, which many researchers attribute to a lack of understanding how the ISO communicates with the ocean, a.k.a. its air-sea interactions.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
