Credit: NOAA\nA new study from scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute of Marine & Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) investigates Hurricane Dorian’s track forecast uncertainties.\nThe paper, published today in Monthly Weather Review, examined a collection (ensemble) of hurricane model runs for Hurricane Dorian to learn why some models performed better than others. This analysis included two objectives: (1) determining the usefulness of ensembles for understanding how hurricanes move, and (2) correctly examining what is happening around the tropical cyclone to accurately predict its track 5 to 7 days later.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
