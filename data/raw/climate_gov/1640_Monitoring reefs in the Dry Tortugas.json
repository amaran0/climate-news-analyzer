The video features the team of Nicole Besemer, Nate Formel, Graham Kolodziej, Anderson Mayfield, and Patrick Kiel, who visited Dry Tortugas National Park, on the edge of Florida Key National Marine Sanctuary, in June 2021. Over the course of several days, the team collected data and recovered/replaced climate and coral monitoring instruments in support of NOAA’s National Coral Reef Monitoring Program. As part of the program, AOML leads monitoring efforts in the Atlantic Ocean to document in-situ climate change and ocean acidification.\nRead more and see the video at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
