Credit: NOAA\nEight new postdoctoral fellows are commencing cutting-edge research projects that will contribute innovative climate science to the research community as well as NOAA’s mission.\nThese fellows are the new 2022-2024 class of NOAA Climate and Global Change (C&GC) Postdoctoral Fellows, supported by NOAA Climate Program Office (CPO) and selected by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).\n“Since 1991, the NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Program has been cultivating  the next generation of climate and global change experts,” said Wayne Higgins, Director of NOAA’s Climate Program Office. “With this year's class of eight talented fellows, the Program has now sponsored more than 250 fellows who are collectively helping to build a diverse community of experts in climate and global change research.”\nChosen from 86 applications through a competitive review process, the fellows are promising early career scientists who are within five years of completing their PhDs. Over the next two years, the eight fellows will be hosted by mentoring scientists at universities and research institutions around the country to conduct projects focused on observing, understanding, modeling, and predicting climate variability and change.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
