Credit: U.S. Forest Service\nWildfire smoke is a common hazard for wildland firefighters who work long shifts under tough conditions. However, exactly how much smoke a firefighter is exposed to depends on their job task, wind speed and direction, where they are stationed, and more, according to a new study published in Environmental Science & Technology. Using data from a field campaign supported by CPOâ€™s Atmospheric Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, & Climate (AC4) program, the study found that almost a fifth of exposures were above the recommended occupational exposure limit, suggesting wildland fire management should find strategies to reduce smoke exposures.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
