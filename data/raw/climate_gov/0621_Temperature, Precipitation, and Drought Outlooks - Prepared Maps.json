  "content": "Climate outlooks describe the chances that conditions will be below-normal, near-normal, or above-normal for the outlook period indicated. The Climate Prediction Center publishes temperature and precipitation outlook maps for four different future periods: 6 to 10 Days, 8 to 14 Days, 1 Month, and 3 Months. The site also publishes maps showing Hazard Outlooks, Drought Status, and Monthly and Seasonal Drought Outlooks.\nClimate scientists base future climate outlooks on current patterns in the ocean and atmosphere. They examine projections from climate and weather models and consider recent trends. They also check historical records to see how much precipitation fell when patterns were similar in the past.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nHow to Read the 6-10 Day Outlook Maps\nHow to read the 8-14 Day Outlook Maps\nHelp us improve our content",
