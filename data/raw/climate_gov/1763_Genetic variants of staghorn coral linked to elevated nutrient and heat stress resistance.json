Credit: NOAA\nA recent study by scientists at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Science, the Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) identified genetic variants in staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, that can tolerate elevated temperatures and nutrient pollution, two environmental stressors that put this critically endangered species at risk. With global climate change in full effect, the identification of stress-resistant genetic variants provides researchers with an important tool for improving coral survival and restoration success, in addition to efforts to preserve genetic diversity and increase coral cover.\nDuring this analysis, scientists found three A. cervicornis variants that maintained higher survivorship and growth rates when stressed with elevated nutrients, both alone and in combination with heat. However, the combination of heat stress and pre-exposure to elevated nutrient levels had the most harmful impact on A. cervicornis compared to either stressor alone.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
