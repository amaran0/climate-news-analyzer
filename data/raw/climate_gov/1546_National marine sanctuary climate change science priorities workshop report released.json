Credit: NOAA Fisheries\nCPO’s Marine Ecosystem Risk Team (MERT) has published its National Marine Sanctuary Climate Change Science Priorities Workshop Report for the public.\nThe report summarizes a cross-NOAA workshop held in late January 2021 that brought together over 130 participants from every site in the sanctuary system as well as from NOAA Research, NOAA Fisheries, NOAA’s National Ocean Service, NOAA Satellites, and external organizations. The workshop strived to identify the climate science and information needs of national marine sanctuaries as well as actions and partnerships to meet those needs. Based on workshop outcomes, the report identifies 10 cross-cutting climate science and information needs that, if met, will increase the resilience of sanctuary resources and advance the ability of sanctuaries to understand and manage climate change impacts.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
