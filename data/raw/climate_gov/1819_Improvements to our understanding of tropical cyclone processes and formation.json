Credit: NOAA\nTropical cyclones are rotating storm systems originating over tropical oceans, and their formation is connected to feedbacks involving solar radiation and fluxes of heat and energy from Earthâ€™s surface. A great deal of previous research has focused on the processes which promote the development of these storms, but they are not fully understood at a level of fine detail. Global climate models (GCMs), even those with low resolution, are able to simulate some rotation patterns of tropical cyclones, but biases are more prominent at lower resolutions.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
