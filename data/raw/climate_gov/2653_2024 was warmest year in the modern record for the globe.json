  "content": "In 2024, global surface temperature was 2.32 °F (1.29°C) above the 20th-century average. This ranks as the highest global temperature in the period of 1850–2024, beating the next warmest year (2023) by 0.18°F (0.10°C). The 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade. In 2024, global temperature exceeded the pre-industrial (1850–1900) average by 2.63°F (1.46°C).\nThis map shows global average temperature in 2024 compared to the 1991-2020 average. Places that were warmer than average—most of the planet—are colored red. Places that were cooler than average are colored blue. The Arctic, Northeast North America, and Japan and the nearby Pacific Ocean were especially warm. The animated graph shows global average temperature each year compared to the 20th-century average starting with 1976 (small blue bar below the line). Every year since, Earth's surface temperature has been warmer than average (pink bars). The last bar is higher than all the others, showing that 2024 set a new record.\nFor more detail on everything from sea ice and snow cover to worldwide tropical cyclone activity, see the full 2024 report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nHelp us improve our content",
