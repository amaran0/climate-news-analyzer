  "content": "Some organisms and environments produce natural records of the past. Paleoclimatology is the study of past climate from these natural records; these records provide evidence of climate conditions from hundreds to millions of years ago.\nPaleoclimatology data are derived from natural sources such as tree rings, cave deposits, ice cores, fire history, coral growth bands, pollen, stalagmites, and ocean and lake sediments. These proxy climate data extend the weather and climate information archive by hundreds to millions of years. This is the world's largest archive of paleoclimatology data, with contributions from the international scientific community. The data include geophysical or biological measurement time series and some reconstructed climate variables such as temperature and precipitation.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nSearch the database for types, dates, or specific locations. View results online, or download data to map or  graph.\nHow do I use the site?\nUse the selection menus to:\nPaleoclimate data are climate records found in nature, known as proxy records.\nTo access the records found in tree rings, corals, sediments, and ice, scientists use coring devices.  From these cores, layers can be analyzed for their chemical composition and other clues of ancient temperature and precipitation patterns.\nHelp us improve our content",
