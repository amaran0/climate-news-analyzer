Since 1960, monitoring programs along Oregon’s coastline have helped to advance the understanding of oceanographic processes. In 1997, a mooring, or permanent structure anchored to the sea floor, was outfitted with scientific instruments to measure water flow velocity throughout the depth of the ocean. A second mooring was placed on Oregon’s continental shelf in 1999 with expanded sampling abilities to collect measurements of velocity, temperature, and conductivity of the ocean water along with meteorological observations. Oregon State University (OSU) has maintained another series of moorings in the region since 2006, contributing to the long term observing effort to maintain meteorological and oceanographic data.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
