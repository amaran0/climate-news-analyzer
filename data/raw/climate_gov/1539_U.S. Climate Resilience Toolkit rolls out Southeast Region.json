Credit: National Park Service\nThe U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit is pleased to announce the availability of a new Southeast Region section. The section features narratives, tools, and case studies on the impacts of climate change across the Southeast and information on how people can build resilience to them. Used with the Climate Resilience Toolkitâ€™s Steps to Resilience, the new section can help communities and managers of natural areas across the Southeast recognize their climate hazards, assess their vulnerabilities, and confront their climate risks.\nContent for the new section was built upon vetted information in the Fourth National Climate Assessment. Regional experts also produced map graphics and added information from recent research. The section offers plain-language narratives about climate impacts that are already occurring and projected to continue across the region, and describes efforts to build resilience.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
