Credit: doi:10.1126/science.adm81\nScientists are investigating a method to store carbon by burying trees in clay, which may prevent decomposition for thousands of years. In a new Science study, researchers analyzed a 3,800-year-old tree found buried in clay that had lost less than 5% of its carbon. This suggests similar burial conditions could preserve wood and prevent carbon release into the atmosphere. Compared to other carbon capture technologies, the scientists found that this method may offer a lower-cost alternative. These findings contribute to understanding long-term carbon storage and its potential role in addressing atmospheric carbon levels.\nClick to read the full article",
