Credit: NOAA\nPredicting ocean conditions is crucial for managing environmental challenges and economic activities like shipping. A new study in Ocean Modeling found that combining data from both the ocean and atmosphere can lead to more accurate forecasts, even in complex environments like the Red Sea. This new approach could lead to more refined and reliable prediction systems, which would have environmental and economic benefits.\nThe researchers created simulations of different ocean and atmosphere conditions using a specialized computer model called the Scrippsâ€“KAUST Regional Integrated Prediction System (SKRIPS).\nClick to read the full article",
