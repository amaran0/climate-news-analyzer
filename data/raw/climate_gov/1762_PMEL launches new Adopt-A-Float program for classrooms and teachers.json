Credit: NOAA PMEL\nPMELâ€™s Global Observations of Biogeochemistry and Ocean Physics research group is looking for high school teachers and classrooms to join our new outreach program, Adopt-A-Float. PMEL researchers are using autonomous robots called Argo profiling floats that measure physical, chemical, and biological variables in the ocean to understand the impacts of climate and ecosystem changes.\nPMEL deploys about 60 floats each year and classrooms can engage with a dedicated float as it collects crucial data across the ocean.\nEach classroom involved in the PMEL Adopt-A-Float Program will get to adopt a float that is about to be deployed in the ocean.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
