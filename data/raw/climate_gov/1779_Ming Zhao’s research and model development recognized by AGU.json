Credit: NOAA GFDL\nFor Ming Zhao’s “growing research accomplishments and leadership in climate model development”, he has been recognized with the 2022 AGU Ascent Award. A Senior Physical Scientist at GFDL, Zhao conducts research focused on challenging topics with extensive societal and economic implications, while also being exceptionally skilled in the development of climate models.\nDr. Zhao successfully led a GFDL team that developed the AM4 model over a four-year period. AM4 lies at the core of GFDL’s CM4, ESM4, and SPEAR, some of the world’s leading global climate models for various climate prediction and climate change applications. The models exhibit particularly high-quality climate simulations of clouds, precipitation, top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes, cloud feedbacks, Madden-Julian Oscillations, tropical cyclones, and sea surface temperatures.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
