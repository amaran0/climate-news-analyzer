Credit: Pixabay\nSea level rise along the U.S. Southeast Coast has seen a dramatic increase since 2010, causing concern for coastal communities. Using observations and climate models to analyze this rapid trend, scientists discovered that multidecadal variations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and changes in wind-driven ocean currents significantly contributed to this rise. These factors, combined with long-term global warming, created a perfect storm that accelerated sea level rise in this region.\nResearchers showed that AMOC variations could predict regional sea level changes up to five years in advance, while wind-driven changes were predictable up to two years ahead. These results, published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, offer a promising predictive framework for the southeast coast.\nClick to read the full article",
