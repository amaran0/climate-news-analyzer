A new study published in Science Advances reveals how high-resolution climate models have improved SST prediction accuracy. These models better represent patterns of temperature changes across the Atlantic and the interactions between wind, evaporation, and sea temperature. Improvements in how the models simulate surface wind responses to SST changes was key to enhancing prediction skills.\nClick to read the full article",
