It's widely recognized as the most comprehensive report of its kind and features NOAA data and models. The budget is updated annually and published at the United Nations Climate Change Conference meetings every year.\nView full budget\nThis document highlights a set of national objectives, a conceptual framework and a phased implementation approach for a U.S. GHG Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System.\nDownload the full PDF\nThis assessment is the U.S. governmentâ€™s preeminent report on climate change impacts, risks, and responses.\nView full assessment\nThis report summarizes the current state of understanding of methane emissions sources and the measurement approaches and evaluates opportunities for methodological and inventory development improvements.\nView full report\nThis report is an authoritative decadal assessment of carbon cycle science that examines the patterns of carbon stocks and fluxes across North America.\nView full report\nThe Action Plan has three key components that include 1) an overview of U.S. federal OA actions to date (2009-2023), 2) U.S. federal priorities for OA research, knowledge applications, and policy integration moving forward, and 3) best practices and recommendations for other national governments developing OA Action Plans.\nView full plan\nThis plan will guide federal research and monitoring investments that will improve our understanding of ocean acidification, its potential impacts on marine species and ecosystems, and adaptation and mitigation strategies.\nView full plan\nThe Ocean Acidification Monitoring Prioritization Plan details how to guide U.S. government efforts towards monitoring that could be deployed to meet the gaps described in the Ocean Chemistry Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment.\nView full plan\nThis subject-focused Science Plan is the first of its kind within NOAA Research, outlining and prioritizing scientific goals related to ocean carbon observing and providing coordination across NOAA Research and with intra-agency, interagency, and international partners.\nDownload the full PDF",
