Credit: Worldview\nThe Meiyu front, or a relatively stable meteorological zone stretching from the east coasts of China and Taiwan to southern Japan, serves as a barrier between Arctic and tropical circulation, playing a large role in determining weather and climate in the region. The front is occasionally disturbed during the summer months with eastward moving precipitation and waves at a scale of about 1,000 km. How this pattern may change with rising global temperatures is unknown, but a new study, partially funded by the Climate Program Office’s Climate Variability & Predictability (CVP) Program, analyzes 18 CMIP-6 climate models to make progress on this question.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
