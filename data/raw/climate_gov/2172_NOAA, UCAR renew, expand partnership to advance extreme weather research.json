The MOU is designed to facilitate sharing research, tools and data by enabling scientists to more productively conduct research with each other.\nNSF NCAR, which is a federally funded research and development center, provides the atmospheric and related Earth system science community with state-of-the-art resources. These resources include supercomputers, research aircraft, sophisticated computer models and extensive data sets.\n“This agreement furthers our mutual mission that focuses on science that helps the nation be better prepared for extreme weather,” said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. “Prioritizing areas of cooperative research and continuing to build on strong relationships enables our scientists to more effectively advance weather, water and climate knowledge.”\nClick to read the full article",
