Credit: Fernleaf\nThe Climate Smart Communities Initiative (CSCI) today announced its first round of awards, with more than $1 million going to help 11 communities on the front lines of the climate crisis. The awards include funding and technical support to help communities accelerate their own climate resilience efforts. Each project matches a funded climate adaptation expert with local officials and community representatives.\nIn 2023, NOAA’s Climate Program Office Communication, Education, and Engagement Division awarded $12.7 million in funding to advance the CSCI. In collaboration with NOAA, the CSCI is managed by a consortium of partners, including the Climate Resilience Fund, EcoAdapt, Fernleaf, Geos Institute, ICF, and the Environment, Equity and Justice Center at NRDC. The initiative is made possible by funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, and is part of NOAA’s efforts to help American communities prepare, adapt and build resilience to weather and climate events.\nClick to read the full article",
