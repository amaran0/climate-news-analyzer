Credit: NOAA\nGlobal warming of surface air temperature is largely due to increases in greenhouse gases, which lead to increased radiative heat fluxes toward Earth's surface. While changes in radiative heat fluxes are known to contribute to surface warming, changes to ocean circulation can also impact the rate of surface warming. Previous studies suggest that projected changes to ocean circulation reduce the rate of global warming. However, the relative contribution of different ocean processes (wind-driven circulation, density, etc.) has not yet been explored.\nIn a new Geophysical Research Letters article, authors Kay McMonigal, Sarah Larson, Shineng Hu, and Ryan Kramer use a climate model to quantify the role of changes to the wind-driven ocean circulation onto global air temperature warming.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
