CPO is committed to funding these awards for two years, conditional on appropriations.\nAccording to the latest figures from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, the U.S. has sustained 400 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters since 1980. This trend underscores the need for greater research that will help society build resilience and enhanced risk management into their planning and preparedness efforts. Substantial improvements are necessary in monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of effective adaptive actions, as well as the development of climate services to best support them.\nClick to read the full article",
