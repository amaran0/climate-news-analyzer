  "content": "Looking at the temperature maps for March 2013, you might think that Old Man Winter over stayed his welcome or that Mother Nature was trying to make up for last March’s record-breaking heat. Much of the country felt spring would never arrive! All kidding aside, the maps above show the reality of the March 2013 temperature statistics, recently released by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center.\nThese maps show where the March 2013 (top) and March 2012 (bottom) temperatures were different from the 1981–2010 average. The shades of red indicate temperatures up to 8° Fahrenheit warmer than average, and the shades of blue indicate temperatures up to 8° Fahrenheit cooler than average. The darker the color, the larger the difference from average.\nThese climate statistics and many others are part of NOAA’s National Monthly Climate Report. The National Climatic Data Center produces these monthly climate reports as part of the suite of climate services that NOAA provides government, business, and community leaders so they can make informed decisions.\nCaption by Susan Osborne and Jake Crouch, adapted from the January 2013 National Climate Report from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).
