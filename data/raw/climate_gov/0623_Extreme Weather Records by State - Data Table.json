This site shows records for every state in categories such as temperature, total amount of rain or snow in 24 hours, weight and diameter of hail-stones, and highest wind gusts.\nRecords in this data come from weather stations and observers who document the extremes they measure. If an existing record may have been tied or exceeded, the State Climate Extremes Committee, an ad hoc committee established to evaluate the climatological records of individual states, is notified, and it is brought to the attention of the local National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Office or the state's State Climatologist. If, after reviewing the observation, the WFO or State Climatologist feels it is legitimate, they will convene the SCEC for a review and vote to accept or reject the value as a new record or a tie in the state's list of most extreme conditions.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHow do I use the site?\nHelp us improve our content",
