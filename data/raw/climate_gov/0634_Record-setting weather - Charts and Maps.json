Compare counts of temperature and precipitation records in the United States or across the globe.\nPlease note that these counts can provide insight into recent climate behavior, but they do not offer a definitive way to identify trends in the number of records set over time.\nThe Daily Weather Records data tool is hosted and maintained by NOAA NCEI as part of Climate Data Online. Broken and tied records counted or displayed by this tool are compiled from a subset of stations in the Global Historical Climatological Network. For a station to be counted as having broken or tied a record, it must have a minimum of 30 years of observations for that variable, with more than 182 days complete during each of the 30 years. If you have further questions or comments about the Daily Weather Records tool, you can reach out to NCEI through this email address.\nHow do I use the site?\nGo to the Daily Weather Records page at NOAA NCEI.\nOn the View Records Summary tab, select U.S. Summaries or Global Summaries, and then scroll down to view the charts.\nOn the  View Selected Records tab, use the drop-down menus to select a timescale, location, and date range, and parameters of your search.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nHelp us improve our content",
