Credit: doi:10.1093/oxfclm/kgae010\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, scientists are exploring Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) as a way to cool the Earth through reflecting sunlight away from the surface. A new article in the Oxford Open Climate Change calls for a comprehensive international assessment of SAIâ€™s potential impacts, risks and benefits. The authors propose a framework that integrates both natural and social sciences with the goal of ensuring that future research is inclusive, especially of underrepresented regions like the Global South, and aligned with shared ethical and governance standards. The proposed approach would use satellite data and ground-based measurements to monitor atmospheric changes and detect the effects of SAI, which is critical for planning safe implementation. This work is essential for guiding informed decisions on whether and how to use SAI as a climate intervention strategy.\nClick to read the full article",
