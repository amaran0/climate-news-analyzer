DOI: 10.1029/2021GL094000\nIn Western North America, 30% of the annual precipitation is determined by atmospheric rivers (ARs) that occur during less than 15% of the winter season. ARs are beneficial to water supply but can also produce extreme precipitation hazards when making landfall. Consequently, ARs exert significant socioeconomic impacts on this region.\nThe authors used GFDLâ€™s new SPEAR seasonal-to-decadal forecast system to produce multi-seasonal AR frequency forecasts with predictive skill at least 9 months in advance. Additional analysis explores the dominant predictability sources and challenges for multi-seasonal AR prediction. Regional dependence of atmospheric river prediction can be explained by its connection to the leading pattern of large-scale atmospheric variability over the North Pacific.\nRead more at the link below.\nClick to read the full article",
