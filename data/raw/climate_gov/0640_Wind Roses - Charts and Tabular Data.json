  "content": "Wondering which direction the wind was from during your last cold snap, or which summer months usually have a breeze?\nFor selected stations (mostly airports) where hourly wind speed and direction are recorded, registered users of MRCC's cli-MATE tools can select any time frame during a station’s period of record to analyze the wind speed and direction, including filtering specific dates or times of the day. There is no cost for registration.\nWind roses are graphical charts that characterize the speed and direction of winds at a location. Presented in a circular format, the length of each \"spoke\" around the circle indicates the amount of time that the wind blows from a particular direction. Colors along the spokes indicate categories of wind speed.\nThe Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC) offers wind roses through its MRCC Application Tools Environment, called cli-MATE. Data are compiled and processed by the Climate Data Access Portal (Cli-DAP), which is maintained by the NOAA Regional Climate Centers (RCCs).\n1)  All users must register and log in for free access to cli-MATE.\nRegister for a cli-MATE account »  (opens in a new tab).\n2)  Once logged in to the cli-MATE site, roll your cursor over Hourly-Observed Data and click Wind Rose\n3) Click Select Hourly Station at the top of the cli-MATE window to open the Hourly Station Selector. Use any of the options available to select a station of interest. Once selected, the name of the station will be listed under CURRENT HOURLY STATION INFORMATION at the top of the Wind Rose window.\nFor help with station selection, watch the Station Selection Video Tutorial\n4) Use the drop-down menus and buttons to set the parameters for your wind rose.\nHelp us improve our content",
