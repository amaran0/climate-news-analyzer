  "content": "Climatologists use historical and current climate and weather data make climate predictions for temperature and precipitation in the future. These outlook products are different from weather forecasts. Rather than predicting specific conditions on specific days, they indicate the chances that average weather conditions will be above- or below-average over the coming season.\nClimate scientists use a complex mix of weather models, historical data, current conditions in the ocean (locations of unusually warm and cool waters and currents), soil moisture content, experience, and expertise to predict which regions are likely to have above- or below-average conditions in the next 3 months.\nClimatological data (1981 – 2010) provides “normal” ranges for temperature and precipitation: climate outlooks describe the chances that upcoming conditions will be in the top or bottom third of historical observations.\nWhat can I do with these data?\nFarmers, ranchers, firefighters, and water and natural resource managers commonly consult climate outlooks to anticipate and prepare for potential future conditions.\nHow do I use the site?\nClick links in the selection table to view different maps and data:\nHelp us improve our content",
