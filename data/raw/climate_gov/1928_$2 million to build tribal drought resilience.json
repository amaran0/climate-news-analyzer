This investment will help tribal nations address current and future drought risk on tribal lands across the Western U.S. while informing decision making and strengthening tribal drought resilience in a changing climate.\n“Drought poses a threat to the culture, economy, health and food availability of tribal nations,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “As part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, a key pillar of Bidenomics, enhancing drought resilience with tribal partners in the West is a crucial step in building a Climate-Ready Nation and resilient communities.”\nProposals may request funding of up to $700,000 total to be disseminated in the first year and expended over three years in the form of cooperative agreements. A total of 3-5 projects may be funded depending on the project budget requested.\nClick to read the full article",
