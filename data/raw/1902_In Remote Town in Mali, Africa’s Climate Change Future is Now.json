  "content": "Ten years ago, I ended up on the mud flats of the Nile delta with a  water engineer. He explained how everything we could see around us would  be under water if sea levels rose as they are predicted to do – the  nearby city of Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable to climate  change in the world.\nIt was just before a major conference on climate  change, and the aim had been to find stories – and images – of global  warming that got beyond the cliche of a melting ice cap. But as a  journalist it was hard to bring this future to life; this sleepy bit of  coastline hardly evoked the sense of urgency required to mobilise the  international attention needed.\nThis is the central paradox of climate change politics, argued the sociologist, Anthony Giddens,  that electorates can’t grasp the significance of climate change because  it is too abstract, and not dramatic enough (they need catastrophe  footage), and won’t – until it’s too late. By the time we are  experiencing massive floods, freak weather, sea-level rises and higher  temperatures, we will be well past the point of doing anything about it.  He christened it Giddens paradox.\nTen years on, the impact of climate change is frighteningly more concrete. In the remote town of Anakila in Mali,  west Africa, I find what we were looking for in the Nile delta 10 years  ago. Campaigners know the power of images to drive the message home,  and that’s why the aid agency Tearfund took me on a 1,000km journey from  the capital, Bamako.\nThree hours after we left the paved road, we  arrived at low mud houses clustered under large mango trees. This is  part of the Sahel, and the nine months of the dry season have always  left a narrow ecological perch for the community and its subsistence  agriculture. They are poor, yet the town is vibrant; the Dogon people are much admired in Mali for their resourcefulness and hard  work. Circling the town are the small vegetable gardens on which they  depend.\nLooming Sand Dune\nFor years now, the elders explain, they have been worried  by climate change. Disrupted rain patterns, shifts in winds have no  parallel in collective memory; they notice how it is prompting changes  in the behaviour of animals and birds. But all of these anxieties are  dwarfed by the sand dune now looming above their town – the result of  those drier, fierce winds and erratic, intense rainfall.\nThe dune  stands several hundred feet high, spilling into the river and stemming  its flow, slowly burying trees whose trunks are now deep in soft white  sand. Plenty of fields have been swallowed by the sand already. The  villagers’ defences against further encroachment are hedges of euphorbia  – they surround the rows of sorghum that stand pitifully in ground  which is more sand than soil.\nThe dune glows golden in the sun, a  dramatic and unfamiliar eruption in the landscape. This area was once  forest, but gradual deforestation has thinned the tree cover and exposed  the sandy soils. The dune is moving inexorably towards the outskirts of  Anakila.\nIt’s a sinister sign of the vulnerability of the Sahel, the  grasslands that border the Sahara in a swath across Africa, and where  millions have farmed and herded cattle for centuries. The ecological  niche in which they have built their lives has always been full of  uncertainties – and often hardship – but now the niche on which they  have built cultures of great sophistication and resilience is shrinking  beneath them as desert threatens.\nFrom Charity to Environmental Justice\nThis is another paradox of  climate-change politics: it is in remote places like this that climate  change will hit first and hardest. It is cultures built on deep  understanding of their environment – whether the Sami of the Arctic or  the Dogon of the Sahara – whose way of life is the first to be  threatened. Anakila’s residents are the canaries down the mine, their  experience a foretaste of an Earth hostile to human inhabitation. But  their experience of threat, potential devastation and loss of livelihood  is discounted and ignored. No dunes are threatening Manchester.\nBut  Anakila’s plight will come back to haunt us in two ways. The entire  debate around Africa and aid will shift in coming years from one  dominated by charity and post-imperial responsibility to one framed  primarily around environmental justice. The continent is one of the most  vulnerable, with many of its delicate ecosystems threatened, as Camilla  Toulmin’s charts in her book, Climate Change in Africa. It is also the least well equipped to respond – and the least responsible for the coming calamities.\nMedia attention on the climate change talks in Cancún focus on the negotiations over emission  cuts, but equally important is the financing of climate adaptation – at  Copenhagen $100bn a year by 2020 was pledged. But the danger is that funding for climate  adaptation will be poached from aid budgets. Already the development  secretary, Andrew Mitchell, has made it clear that the pledge for  foreign aid of 0.7% of GDP inherited from Labour will be used to finance  climate adaptation. Ensuring this money reaches communities as  marginalised and as poor as Anakila is a huge challenge.\nA Missing Generation\nThe  second way in which Anakila affects us is even more direct. In the faces  crowded around me, I realized that there was a missing generation. This  was a community of the elderly and the very young, with only a few  young women – and virtually no young or middle-aged men. If you have  ever wondered in Paris, Barcelona or Rome where the men come from who  are trying to sell armfuls of jewellery that no one seems to want, then  perhaps places like Anakila might be the answer. We met one man who had  got as far as Manchester twice – both times turned back.\nMigration  puts an added burden on the village. Without their labour, it is even  harder to sustain and provide for the community; migration accelerates  the disintegration of their way of life. The most ambitious and  resourceful attempt the dangerous journey to Europe. Many others swell  the sprawling growth of Bamako, one of Africa’s fastest-growing cities.\nAs  we left Anakila, we were given gifts – fresh milk and two hens. When  might this generosity become a demand for environmental justice? When  might such visits prompt anger and recriminations instead of smiles and  greetings?\nMali is a country of crushing poverty, and the predicted  outcomes of climate change could spell catastrophe for much of the  country. It’s only a matter of time before the  demand for compensation becomes the rallying cry for a new generation of  activists – not just in Africa, but across the globe.\n(UN Photo, Bandiagara, Mali by John Isaac)\nSee Also\nAfrica’s Agriculture Vulnerable to Breakdown Under Climate Change\nEU Land-Grabbing in Africa for Biofuels Is Target of NGO Campaign\nAs Global Warming Makes Crops Impossible, a Shift to Camels\nNations Threatened by Climate Change Call on Developed World to Give 1.5% of GDP\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
