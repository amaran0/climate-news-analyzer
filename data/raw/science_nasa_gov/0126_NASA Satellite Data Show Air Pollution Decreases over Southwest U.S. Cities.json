  "content": "On March 19, California was one of the first states to set mandatory stay-at-home restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Arizona and Nevada followed suit around April 1.\nThe Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board NASA's Aura satellite provided data that indicate that these restrictions have led to about a 31% decrease in NO2 levels in the Los Angeles basin relative to previous years.\nNO2, or nitrogen dioxide, is an air pollutant measured by OMI. The estimated reductions for other cities in the Southwest U.S. before and after the quarantine restrictions are 22% for the San Francisco Bay Area; 25% for San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico; 16% for Phoenix; and 10% for Las Vegas.\nFor more information on NASA's air quality research, visit https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov.\nThe visual for this article and other regions can be downloaded from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.\nFor more information please contact:\nPeter Jacobs\nPublic Affairs Officer\npeter.jacobs@nasa.gov\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
