Amazing things can be discovered from the perspective of orbit, and that's why NASA has over a dozen satellites whizzing over our heads right now. We study the oceans, land, atmosphere, ice and snow, climate change, air quality, solar effects, earthquakes, volcanoes, weather and even the Earth's gravitational field, and there are many more exciting missions planned for the future.\nToday on the fortieth anniversary of Earth Day, take a moment to appreciate the majesty and beauty of our home planet with this video we put together.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
