A new Web portal developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, gives researchers, decision makers and the public alike a resource to stay up to date with the latest developments and scientific findings in this rapidly advancing field of study.\nThe portal, “Sea Level Change: Observations from Space,” is online at:\nhttps://sealevel.nasa.gov/\nThe portal’s key features include:\nThe website is optimized for most mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n“Sea Level Change: Observations from Space” is managed by a team led by JPL scientist Carmen Boening. The team is part of the NASA Sea Level Change Team research group.\n“With sea levels rising globally, as observed by satellites over the past decades, sea level change is a hot topic in climate research,” Boening said. “This new tool provides a NASA resource for researchers and a wealth of information for members of the public seeking a deeper understanding of sea level change.”\nFor more information on NASA's Earth science activities, visit:\nhttp://climate.nasa.gov and http://www.nasa.gov/earth\nAlan Buis\r\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\r\n818-354-0474\r\nAlan.buis@jpl.nasa.gov\nAn in-depth look at the science behind sea level change as observed from space.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
