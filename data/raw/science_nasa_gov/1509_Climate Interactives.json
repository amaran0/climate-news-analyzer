  "content": "Explore our changing planet through NASA's eyes. Visualize satellite data, see changes over time on land, glaciers, and in the ocean, and discover evidence for Earth's past climates. Then, test your knowledge with one of our quizzes.\nBefore-and-after images of Earth.\nGo backward and forward in time with this interactive visualization that illustrates how the Earth's climate has changed in recent history.\nExplore the sentinels of climate change with this interactive global ice viewer.\nThere are many ways scientists can unravel Earth’s climate history, going back billions of years. Explore the tools used by climate scientists with this interactive timeline.\nTrack Earth's vital signs and fly along with NASA's Earth-observing satellites. See natural hazards from space and view near-real-time science data with this stunning 3D visualization.\nTest your knowledge about global temperature change and its impact on Earth's climate.\nHow much do you know about how water is cycled around our planet and the crucial role it plays in our climate?\nLooking at our Earth from space, it is obvious that we live on a water planet. Ocean covers over 70 percent of the Earth's surface and contains about 97 percent of the Earth's surface water. How much do you know about our ocean?\nEarth is an ever-changing place. How much do you know about your home planet?\nMany more to explore.\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.",
