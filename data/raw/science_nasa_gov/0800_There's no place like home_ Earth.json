And it's also a fragile place, where the ice and the ocean play an important role in our changing climate and our future.\nMajestic PlanetLand. Water. Fire. Ice. These elements are basic ingredients that make up planet Earth. Take a moment to admire the magnificent spectacle of our stunning home planet from the perspective of space.\r\nCredit: JPL\nEarth: The Water PlanetThe ocean is responsible for Earth's mild climate and makes life on Earth possible for all creatures. As global ocean temperatures increase, the ocean water expands causing sea level rise which can have disastrous impacts on low-lying coastal regions.\r\nCredit: JPL\nFrozen EarthIce covers 10 percent of Earth's surface and helps moderate the planet's temperature. Glaciers and ice sheets around the world are melting at an alarming rate. By keeping an eye on Earth's ice from space, NASA satellites help us understand the global effects of climate change.\r\nCredit: JPL\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
