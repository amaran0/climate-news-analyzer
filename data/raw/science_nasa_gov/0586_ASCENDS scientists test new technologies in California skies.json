Plans call for cruising over the Pacific Ocean, forests in Northern California, the Oregon coast and cornfields in Indiana. Flights should wrap up around the end of August.\nNASA Langley, along with the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are all honing new carbon dioxide measurement techniques and technologies under a mission called ASCENDS, which stands for Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days and Seasons.\nThe systems use lasers to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the air between the instrument and Earth’s surface. Existing satellites use reflected sunlight to gauge carbon dioxide, so they only work in daylight conditions. Carbon dioxide is considered an important contributor to global warming, so NASA wants to make more measurements under a wider set of conditions.\nLangley’s team will measure carbon dioxide using a tool called the Multi-functional Fiber Laser Lidar, or MFLL. Developed by Indiana-based Exelis Inc. (formerly ITT Geospatial Systems), the MFLL is the predecessor of an instrument called the ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator, or ACES, which a team composed of researchers from Langley, Exelis and other partners have developed.\n“Any instrument could potentially have bugs, and stuff you have to work out, precision issues that you have to demonstrate,” said Byron Meadows, NASA Langley’s ASCENDS project manager. “That’s what the ASCENDS project here has been all about over the years.” Flights like the ones happening this summer have taken place since 2010.\nNASA leadership hasn’t announced plans to build and launch an ASCENDS satellite yet. ASCENDS experiments will help the agency choose the right system when that day comes.\nThe concern and debate over climate change makes accurate, detailed carbon dioxide measurements more important than ever.\nThrough efforts like ASCENDS, scientists hope to shed light on what’s happening in Earth’s atmosphere. “That’s what we’re here for,” Meadows said, “to change question marks into periods.”\nLast year’s increase was due to an unusual amount of ocean warming, combined with meltwater…\nNASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, is preparing today for tomorrow’s mission.
