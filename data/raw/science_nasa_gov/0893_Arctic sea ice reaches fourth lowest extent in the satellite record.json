NSIDC scientists provide Arctic Sea Ice News & Analysis content, with partial support from NASA.\nArctic sea ice cover appears to have reached its minimum extent on September 11, 2015. Sea ice extent on that day was measured at 4.41 million square kilometers (1.70 million square miles). It was the fourth lowest extent recorded since satellites began measuring sea ice in 1979.\nPlease note that the Arctic sea ice extent number is preliminary—changing winds could still push the ice extent lower. NSIDC will issue a formal announcement at the beginning of October with full analysis of the possible causes behind this year's ice conditions, particularly interesting aspects of the melt season, the set up going into the winter growth season ahead, and graphics comparing this year to the long-term record.\nSee the full announcement at NSIDC's Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis page.\nData related to climate change that can help inform and prepare America’s communities, businesses and citizens.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
