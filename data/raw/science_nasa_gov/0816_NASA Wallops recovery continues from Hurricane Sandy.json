The Wallops Shoreline Protection Project has been managing the restoration efforts and released before and after photos of the shoreline.\n\r\n At 8 a.m. EDT on Oct. 29, 2012, the National Hurricane Center reported tropical-storm-force winds were occurring along the coasts of southern New Jersey, Delaware and eastern Virginia. Tropical-storm-force winds extended as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay as Hurricane Sandy closed in for landfall.\nNASA's Aqua satellite captured a visible image Sandy's massive circulation on Oct. 29 at 18:20 UTC (2:20 p.m. EDT). Sandy covers 1.8 million square miles, from the Mid-Atlantic to the Ohio Valley, into Canada and New England.

Tropical-storm-force winds extended as far inland as the central and southern Chesapeake Bay as Hurricane Sandy closed in for landfall.\nNASA Wallops released three images showing the shoreline in 2011, in August 2012 following the completion of the Shoreline Protection Project, and in November 2012, showing the extent of the damages from the storm. The November 2012 photograph clearly shows extensive beach erosion. Wallops is now working to conduct an out-of-cycle beach replenishment and to repair the protective berm.\n\r\n NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) was established in 1945 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics as a center for aeronautics research, and is now NASA's principal facility for managing and implementing suborbital research programs.\n\r\n WFF is located in the northeastern portion of Accomack County, Va., on the Delmarva Peninsula, and is comprised of three land masses: the Main Base, Wallops Mainland and Wallops Island. Wallops Island consists of approximately 1,680 hectares (4,600 acres), is bounded by Chincoteague Inlet to the north, Assawoman Island to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the east and estuaries to the west.\n\r\n For the complete NASA history, images and videos of Hurricane Sandy, visit NASA's Hurricane Web page at: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/archives/2012/h2012_Sandy.html\nNASA Wallops released three images showing the shoreline in 2011, in August 2012 following the completion of the Shoreline Protection Project, and in November 2012, showing the extent of the damages from the storm.
