Let’s take a look at a few storm facts:\nBut is climate change responsible for brewing more, and stronger, hurricanes? There’s a school of thought that says that climate change should fuel more hurricanes and more intense ones, because as the planet warms, ocean waters warm and sea surface temperature rises.\nIn a paper published earlier this year in Science, Thomas R. Knutson, of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and co-authors suggest that we should expect an increase in the frequency of the strongest hurricanes in the Atlantic, roughly by a factor of two by the end of the century, despite a decrease in the overall number of hurricanes. “But we should not expect this trend to be clearly detectable until we near the end of the century, given a scenario in which CO2 [carbon dioxide] doubles by 2100.” The relationship will become more apparent as we improve our understanding and data and as the climate continues to warm.\n(Knutson offers a review of the published research findings on this topic to date here.)\nIn the meantime, the storm-chasing will continue.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
