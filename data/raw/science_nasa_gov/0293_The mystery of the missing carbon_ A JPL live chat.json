The Orbiting Carbon Observatory's mission is to find the vast warehouses of carbon dioxide that are \"missing\" - hidden in \"sinks\" around the globe. Finding them will help scientists better predict how our climate will change in the future.\nChip Miller, deputy principal investigator for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, will explain the mission and answer your questions live on Ustream TV on Feb. 9 at 5 p.m. Pacific: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasajpl  . If you are unable to take part in the live chat, you can submit questions in advance to carolina.martinez@jpl.nasa.gov and watch the archived video at a later time.\n+ More about OCO\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
