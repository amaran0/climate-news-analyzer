By 1960, that number had more than quadrupled to over 9 billion metric tons.\nThe latest data from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center shows that over 35 billion metric tons of CO2 were released in 2014. *\nBecause emissions are only partially reduced by natural land and ocean sinks, the rest of the annual carbon dioxide emissions from the human burning of fossil fuels remains in Earth's atmosphere, resulting in the annual year-over-year rise in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, as seen here.\nExplore NASA's climate vital signs to learn more about carbon dioxide and other factors related to climate change.\n* Latest annual data from CDIAC\nData sources: Our World in Data, CDIAC\nLearn More\nFAQ: How might Earth’s atmosphere, land, and ocean systems respond to changes in carbon dioxide over time?\nNASA uses satellite lidar technology to study Earth’s forests, key carbon sinks.\nFlorida’s coastal wetlands face new threats as sea levels and temperatures climb.
