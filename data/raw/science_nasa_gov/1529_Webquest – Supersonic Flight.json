  "content": "NASA is building the X-59 QueSST, an experimental aircraft for quiet supersonic flight over land. Supersonic flight is faster than the speed of sound and produces a sonic boom, an extreme form of noise pollution. QueSST stands for \"Quiet SuperSonic Technology.\" The X-59 QueSST is testing the technology to fly faster and more efficiently, and to reduce the loudness of a sonic boom reaching land.\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.",
