You may think you know all about our planet, but you're in for some surprises as season three of NASA's \"On a Mission\" podcast shares insights from researchers who explore the highest heights and the deepest depths, weaving together a saga of the strange yet familiar place we call home.\nHosted by Leslie Mullen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the 10 episodes take us from deep space, where Earth looks like a pale blue dot, to below our home planet's surface. The audio journeys show not just how the planet's volcanoes, earthquakes, oceans, rivers, atmosphere, and climate work, but how they are all interconnected.\n\"It's a perfect year to look at Earth,\" Mullen said, noting the pandemic, raging wildfires, and record-setting storms. \"The different systems on Earth are tied together in an intricate pattern. What happens when you pull on one thread - how does it affect something else?\"\nYou can find \"On a Mission\" at NASA or Soundcloud. And don't miss the first two award-winningseasons, which focus on the Mars InSight mission and asteroids.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
