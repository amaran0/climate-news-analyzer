So atmospheric scientists are working around the clock to narrow the range reported by the IPCC in the hopes of better forecasting the future. And the best way to do that, it turns out, is in the clouds.\nClouds are the single largest source of uncertainty in predictions of climate change, the IPCC declared in 2007. While some climate models — mathematical representations of the physical forces that shape climate — depict an increase in cloud cover by the year 2100, others show a decrease because of the difficulty of accurately representing clouds. “We just don’t know what will happen to the clouds,” says Joao Teixeira, Deputy Director of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Center for Climate Sciences.\nClouds are the single largest source of uncertainty in predictions of climate change, the IPCC declared in 2007.

Recently, JPL researchers demonstrated the ability to improve large climate change model predictions by simulating the formation of clouds on small scales, at higher resolution than ever before. This effort, to emphasize the trees in order to better see the forest, could help us better understand the future of the planet on which we live.\nToday, Teixeira and colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are on the hunt to find out.

Clouds currently have an overall cooling effect on the planet, but as the Earth heats due to global warming, the type and position of clouds could change.\nClouds cover about 70 percent of the Earth's surface and have an enormous effect on climate: Some clouds, especially low-lying hazy or puffy clouds, reflect sunshine and cool the planet; others, such as high, wispy clouds, trap heat emanating from Earth’s surface and warm the planet. Clouds currently have an overall cooling effect on the planet, but as the Earth heats due to global warming, the type and position of clouds could change.\nGeorgios Matheou is a research scientist with the Climate Physics Group at JPL.So to predict climate change over the next 10 to 100 years, scientists need to be able to accurately predict what will happen to clouds. But despite simple ingredients — tiny droplets of water or ice crystals — clouds are extraordinarily complex entities governed by competing physical forces, and it takes a significant amount of computing power to calculate how they form and change.\nSo to predict climate change over the next 10 to 100 years, scientists need to be able to accurately predict what will happen to clouds.

In fact, though scientists know the equations needed to model the physical processes that determine the formation and evolution of clouds, today’s computers can’t handle the complex calculations that are required to simulate each and every cloud that forms across the globe. Instead, atmospheric scientists resort to dividing the planet into large boxes, or “grid cells,” ranging from 100 to 300 kilometers (60 to 190 miles) on each side. In each of these boxes, a computer algorithm calculates a coarse estimate of cloud formation and movement. This way the calculation becomes computationally feasible, but at the expense of fine detail.\n“Computers are getting better and better, but still their power is limited,” says Teixeira.

Because of this, clouds are not realistically simulated in current weather and climate models.\nSince clouds are formed by small-scale atmospheric motions, Bretherton says, the interaction and combination of the different atmospheric motions – small and large – is difficult to be accurately represented in the large grid boxes.

In their tiny boxes, Matheou and Chung analyzed turbulence, the chaotic motion that occurs as warm air from Earth’s surface rises and mixes with the air above, forming clouds and storms.\nTogether with Daniel Chung, a former JPL postdoctoral fellow and now a lecturer in mechanical engineering at the University of Melbourne in Australia, Matheou divided climate model grid cells of 100-kilometers by 100-kilometers into 10-meter by 10-meter cloud boxes and again into 1-millimeter by 1-millimeter turbulence boxes, like opening a Russian doll to pull out smaller and smaller dolls from inside.

While shear destabilizes layers of air, stratification stabilizes them, so “it’s like a competition between the two,” says Matheou. “And we’ve tried to figure out the dynamics of this competition.”\nThe duo developed computer simulations of turbulence on these small scales under various degrees of stratification — in which lighter air sits atop heavier air — and shear — when the upper layer moves faster than the lower one.

They presented their results at the 64th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Baltimore, Maryland, in November 2011, and subsequently published them in April 2012 in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. The images produced (Figure 3) were awarded the Division of Fluid Dynamic’s 2011 Milton Van Dyke Award for artistic value, scientific content and originality.\nUsing one of the world’s fastest supercomputers, Pleiades at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, California, Matheou and Chung recorded how different levels of shear and stratification affect the amount of turbulence in a small space.
