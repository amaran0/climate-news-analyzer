September 2012 reached a low of 3.6 million square kilometers, almost half as much as the 1979 to 2000 mean of 7 million square kilometers.\nLearn more:\nWhat happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic, and a new NASA mission…\nIt’s not just rising air and water temperatures influencing the decades-long decline of Arctic sea…\nEditor’s note, April 16, 2024: An earlier version of this article included a rounded figure…\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.",
