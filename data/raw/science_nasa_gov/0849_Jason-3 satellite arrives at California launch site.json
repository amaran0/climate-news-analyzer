Additionally, Jason-3 data will help the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration accurately predict when tropical cyclones will intensify.\nJason-3 is an international partnership led by NOAA with participation from NASA, France's Centre Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales (the French space agency) and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, built Jason-3's radiometer, GPS and laser reflector and is funding the launch. JPL will also help oversee the science team, which is responsible for ensuring the quality of the data.\nLearn more about NASA's ocean surface altimetry missions.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
