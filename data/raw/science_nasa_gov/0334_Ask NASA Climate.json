On May 10, 2010, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this view of a thick plume of ash blowing east and then south from the volcano (top left). The ash plume can be seen streaming in a straighter, more steady path than the day before, indicating winds were stronger than they were on May 9. Farther south in the image the ash plume has become partially obscured by higher clouds (white). By May 10, the ash had reached North Africa, Turkey and Morocco.\nCaption courtesy of NASA's Earth Portal.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
