The Maldives is made up of a chain of 1192 small coral islands that are grouped into clusters of atolls. It has a population of about 330,000. Arguably the lowest-lying country in the world, the average elevation is 1 meter (3 feet) above sea level, and the Maldives is at serious risk of being inundated by rising sea level and storm surges. In an effort to prevent his archipelago nation from literally drowning, Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed is pushing to make the islands carbon-neutral by 2020.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
