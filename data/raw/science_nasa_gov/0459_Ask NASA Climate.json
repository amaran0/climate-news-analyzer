Since Martin is a visual artist, he's chosen to express his ideas in visual form, along with a few sentences explaining his thoughts about the artwork.\nIt is a weird combination to mix art with science, however that doesn't mean it isn't fun. Coming from an artistic background with no particular interest in science, becoming a cartoonist for climate change at JPL was a sudden turn.\nI'm surprised to find out that science can be fun if you look at it from your own perspective.\nI call this drawing \"Climate Change Is Happening.\"  The idea for this cartoon came during my oceanography class when we were joking about how climate change is bad for humans, but not necessarily for all life on Earth. Some species might benefit, such as roaches, which are a real nasty piece of work. For them, climate change might be one big party.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
