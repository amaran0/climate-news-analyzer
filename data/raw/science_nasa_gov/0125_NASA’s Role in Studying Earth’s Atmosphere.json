  "content": "3 min read\nStudying Earth’s atmospheric composition is a key focus area for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate and Earth Science Division. NASA’s Atmospheric Composition focus area conducts research on Earth’s atmosphere, including its chemical and physical properties, Earth’s energy budget and air quality. The focus area studies the variations in and processes that affect aerosols, clouds and trace gases like ozone, which influence climate, weather and air quality.\nThe Atmospheric Composition focus area provides observations and modeling tools to assess the effects of climate change on ozone recovery and future atmospheric composition; improve climate forecasts based on fluctuations in global environmental change; and model past, present and future air quality, both regionally and globally. This research, combined with observations, data assimilation and modeling, improves society’s ability to predict how future changes in atmospheric composition will affect climate, weather and air quality.\nNASA researchers are interested in the following overarching research questions:\nThe agency’s four major atmospheric composition research programs include:\nThese programs are supported by NASA’s broad fleet of Earth observing satellites, together with numerous ground- and aircraft-based suborbital investigations. A number of additional satellite and aircraft missions are currently in development or under study.\nFor more on how NASA studies Earth’s atmosphere, visit:\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/programs/research-analysis/atmospheric-composition\n— Alan Buis/NASA's Global Climate Change website\n‹ Back to main article: 'The Atmosphere: Tracking the Ongoing Recovery of Earth's Ozone Hole'\nScience in Space June 2025 Scientists use instruments on the International Space Station to study…\nSince last fall, NASA scientists have flown an advanced 3D Doppler wind lidar instrument across…\nAs part of a science mission tracking one of Earth’s most precious resources – water…\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.",
