There are two key areas\r\ntoward which NASA satellite measurements can contribute:\n1. \r\nMonitoring changes in the Earth’s climate.  Global climate\r\nchange occurs slowly relative to weather and even to the change of seasons\r\nthroughout the year. Changes known to be related to global climate change--increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (including\r\nwater vapor), sea level rise, and the melting of Arctic sea ice and the Greenland\r\nand Antarctic ice sheets--are so gradual that it takes many years, even decades,\r\nto characterize and quantify them.\n1. \r\nMonitoring changes in the Earth’s climate.

Continuity in our satellite observations is important for\r\nmaintaining long records of key climate indicators, such as those listed above.  Having long and continuous records of these\r\nis critical for monitoring the effects of climate change, helping determine how\r\nwe can best adapt to them, and assessing whether measures to limit its effects\r\nare working as expected.\nGiven\r\nthat satellite missions typically last on the order of three to 10 years, NASA\r\noften needs to consider launching copies of some instruments, as current\r\nversions age and fail.

Simply monitoring some of the climate\r\nchange indicators listed above doesn’t provide enough information for\r\nscientists to fully understand and characterize the problem and\r\nconsequences.\n2. \r\nImproving our understanding of global climate change key processes.

For such projections to be\r\nuseful, they have to accurately represent the Earth’s climate system.\n\nThus, some of NASA's satellite program focuses on developing new observations to illuminate how the Earth's climate system works and to reduce uncertainties in global models used for climate projection.\nThus, some of NASA's satellite program focuses on developing new observations to illuminate how the Earth's climate system works and to reduce uncertainties in global models used for climate projection.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
