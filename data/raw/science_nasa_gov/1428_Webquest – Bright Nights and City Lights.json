  "content": "Many satellites are equipped to look at Earth during the day, when they can observe our planet fully illuminated by the sun. But what about at night?\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite  is sensitive enough to detect the nocturnal glow produced by Earth's atmosphere and the light from a single ship in the sea.\nTake some time to explore the Beautiful Earth Gallery. Find the \"Night Lights, Big Cities\" image and try to find the Nile River, Chicago, the boundary between North and South Korea, and the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.\nExplore Earth Science\nNASA's unique vantage point helps us inform solutions to enhance decision-making, improve livelihoods, and protect our planet.\nEarth Science Data\nFacts About Earth\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.",
