The 14th Annual Webby Awards gala was held at the Cipriani in New York City where we collected our “People’s Voice Award” for Best Science Website.\nAs B.J. Novak (the intern from the TV series “The Office”) hosted the awards, we shared a table with colleagues from NASA websites NASA.gov and NASA Home and City 2.0, both of whom picked up a Webby in the government website category. Oh, and we just so happened to be seated with none other than Buzz Aldrin, the second person to set foot on the Moon, and his wife Lois. Buzz was swarmed with fans the whole night long. He went up on stage to accept the award on behalf of all three NASA sites and got a standing ovation along the way. His five-word speech was “Humanity. Colonization. Phobos. Monolith. Mars.”\nThere were a handful of other celebs present, including Dr. Vint Cerf (co-inventor of the internet, who received the Lifetime Achievement Award and gave one of the best speeches of the night: “You ain’t seen nothing yet.”), Roger Ebert (Person of the Year), Amy Poehler (Actress of the Year) and band OK Go (for Film and Video Artist of the Year; see here for more on their collaboration with NASA folks).\nThanks to all the folks out there who voted for us and helped us win the People’s Voice Award. You spoke, the Webbys listened, and we’re super-grateful for your support. You can watch our five-word speech here.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
