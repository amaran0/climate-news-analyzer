Bombetoka Bay is an inlet of the Mozambique Channel, which separates Madagascar from Africa to the west. In the picture, water is sapphire and tinged with pink where sediment is particularly thick. Dense vegetation can be seen in deep green.\nJust downstream is the second largest port of Madagascar — the town of Mahajanga — a road terminus and trade center that exports among other things sugar, coffee, spices, timber and vanilla. The surrounding area contains extensive coffee plantations.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
