It is the fraction of solar energy that is reflected from the Earth's surface back into space.\nA feedback is the process through which a system is controlled, changed, or modulated in response to its own output. Positive feedback results in amplification of the system output; negative feedback reduces the output of a system.\nClimate forcing refers to an energy imbalance caused by natural or man-made processes causing an energy imbalance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing heat from the Earth.\nThe cryosphere is the part of the Earth's surface where water is frozen solid, including glaciers, ice sheets, sea and lake ice, snow cover, and permafrost.\nGlobal climate change is change recorded over an extended length of time (decades or longer) with regards to precipitation, temperature, or wind caused by natural and/or manmade factors.\nThe hydrosphere is the water layer of the Earth. About 70% of the Earth's surface is covered with water, most of which is in the oceans. Only a small portion of the Earth's water is freshwater, found in rivers, lakes, and groundwater.\nThe lithosphere is made up of the Earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle layer underneath. The lithosphere extends about 80 km deep and is broken into giant plates that move and shift, causing earthquakes.\nPermafrost is soil at or below the freezing point of water for two or more years.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
