Where did the idea of\nSmallSats come from, and what are JPL's plans involving them?\nThe development of SmallSats dates back to the 1970s.\nThe idea of a CubeSat class spacecraft, however, originated in 1999 when Prof.\nJordi Puig-Suari of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Prof. Bob Twiggs of Stanford\nUniversity proposed standards to promote student project development and to enable regular,\nsafe access to launch vehicles and space.\nThe development of SmallSats dates back to the 1970s.\nThe idea of a CubeSat class spacecraft, however, originated in 1999 when Prof.\nJordi Puig-Suari of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Prof. Bob Twiggs of Stanford\nUniversity proposed standards to promote student project development and to enable regular,\nsafe access to launch vehicles and space.\nThere are nine active JPL CubeSat science and\ntechnology efforts selected for launch opportunities between 2013-2016,\nand additional missions are in development.

Can you tell us about\nsome interesting and creative applications of CubeSats so far (and upcoming)?\nMost CubeSats launched to date served educational objectives. Today,\nhowever, many are pushing boundaries in science and technology. An interesting\nexample is NASA's NanoSail-D, which deployed\na 100 square meter solar sail to test de-orbit\ncapabilities, but the technology could be used for many other purposes\nincluding deep space propulsion. Scientific\nmeasurements are also advancing. Utah State University’s Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE)\nconsists of two identical spinning CubeSats performing space weather\nexperiments related to Earth's ionosphere [the region\nabout 50 to 250 miles (80 to 400 km) above Earth's surface].\nGoing forward,\ninvestigators are becoming more ambitious. Within JPL, the GRIFEX mission will test new detector technology relevant to future missions\nthat will study the composition of Earth's atmosphere. The ISARA CubeSat will\ndemonstrate new antenna technology with the potential to improve\nCubeSat communication bandwidth 100-fold. We are also developing the INSPIRE\nCubeSat, which will demonstrate first-of-a-kind capabilities for performing\nCubeSat science and technology validation in deep space.\n2.

What advantages and disadvantages\ndo small satellites have compared to larger ones?\n3. What advantages and disadvantages\ndo small satellites have compared to larger ones?\nThe advantages are lower cost, a rapid concept\ndevelopment-to-launch process, student engagement and education,\ncreativity in mission concept design (such as constellations for greater\ncoverage), and the capability to advance new technologies. And, in some\ninstances, they can provide unique science observations.\nThe advantages are lower cost, a rapid concept\ndevelopment-to-launch process, student engagement and education,\ncreativity in mission concept design (such as constellations for greater\ncoverage), and the capability to advance new technologies. And, in some\ninstances, they can provide unique science observations.\nSmall satellites allow for greater risk,\nbut this must be managed as for any flight project. For CubeSats\nthe disadvantages, in general, are measurement-specific. There are very\nimportant observations that are simply not compatible with small\nplatforms. \"Shorter operational lifetime\" is sometimes seen as a\ndisadvantage, but there are some CubeSats that have been in operation for\nnearly 10 years.\nSmall satellites allow for greater risk,\nbut this must be managed as for any flight project.

Are there any CubeSats in\noperation?\nMany CubeSats in operation have been\nlaunched both within the U.S. and internationally. Universities, industry, and\ngovernment organizations developed them over time. Their orbital trajectories\nare being tracked, but an exact number in operation is hard to assess. There\nwill be roughly 100 new CubeSats launched in the 2013-2014 timeframe alone.\nMany CubeSats in operation have been\nlaunched both within the U.S. and internationally.

While past lifetimes have been limited,\ndue to failures, most CubeSats launched within the last few years\nare still operational.\nMost CubeSats are designed to last at least one year while\nsatisfying a 25-year de-orbit requirement.
