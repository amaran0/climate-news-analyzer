The spacecraft is revealing never-before-seen details of material streaming outward and away from sunspots. Other images offer extreme close-ups of activity on the sunâ€™s surface, and the first high-resolution measurements of solar flares in a broad range of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. The sun's activities affect everything on Earth, and SDO should offer unprecedented insights into our star's dynamic processes.
