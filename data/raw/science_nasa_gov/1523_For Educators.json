Most of our weather and clouds are found here - the atomosphere is an important part of what makes Earth livable.\nThe biosphere is all life on our planet including life on land and in the oceans. The biosphere influences the amounts of some of the major greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide - so it is an integral part of global climate.\nClimate feedbacks are interactions between processes within the climate system that result in an initial process triggering changes in a second process that in turn influence the initial one.\nClimate forcings refer to an energy imbalance caused by natural or man-made processes causing an energy imbalance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing heat from the Earth.\nGlobal climate change is change recorded over an extended length of time (decades or longer) with regards to precipitation, temperature or wind caused by natural and/or manmade factors.\nGlobal warming refers to the increase in the average temperature of the earth's atmosphere, sufficient to cause climate change.\nThe hydrosphere is the water layer of the Earth. About 70% of the Earth's surface is covered with water, most of which is in the oceans. Only a small portion of the Earth's water is freshwater, found in rivers, lakes, and groundwater.\nThe lithosphere is made up of the Earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle layer underneath. The lithosphere extends about 80 km deep and is broken into giant plates that move and shift, causing earthquakes.\nThis website is produced by the Earth Science Communications Team at\nSite last updated: September 21, 2023",
