Instead of gas, electricity will be now used for heating in the building, backstopped by a diesel generator, Arora said.\nNational Grid owns a utility that distributes gas to parts of New York City and neighbouring Long Island. In May, the utility refused all new gas service after the Cuomo administration turned down a permit for an additional supply pipeline.\nPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.\nThe drama intensified last month when Cuomo said his administration had received reports that National Grid was improperly denying service, including to existing customers who temporarily needed to turn off their connections. The governor suggested National Grid could lose its right to operate in the state.\nNational Grid, which is under intense scrutiny in its home market after a major blackout last month, contends it needs the pipeline to meet a 10 percent increase in gas demand over the next decade as New York’s economy grows and building owners abandon oil as a source of heat. A coalition of environmental groups have pressured Cuomo to block it.\nThe dispute encapsulates thorny questions policymakers face as shale drilling unleashes U.S. gas output while climate scientists urge a sharp reduction in fossil fuel use. Natural gas produces less carbon dioxide than oil or coal when it is burned, but it still accounts for 43 percent of New York state’s emissions from combustion, according to a government report.\nU.S. gas production has risen 60 percent in the past decade to an estimated 91 billion cubic feet per day. The most prolific gasfield lies a few hundred miles west of New York City in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania, offering a convenient source of energy.\nGas is now cheaper than heating oil, adjusted for energy value. Under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York City encouraged a shift to gas in part because it causes less pollution.\nBut increasingly dire warnings about the climate have amplified calls for a halt to new pipelines. The Cuomo administration earlier this decade rejected the Constitution gas pipeline proposed to run through upstate New York. Federal regulators initially agreed that the state was in its right to reject the permit, but they reversed that decision last month.\n“The science is very clear globally that we need to stop building fossil fuel infrastructure. It’s a climate disaster,” said Kim Fraczek, director of Sane Energy Project, a campaign group in New York.\nBlaming interstate pipeline supply constraints, the New York utility Con Edison in March suspended new gas connections for most of suburban Westchester county.\nCuomo’s department of public service said it is investigating both Con Edison and National Grid “to determine whether they took appropriate actions to balance the need for reliability with customer impacts in declaring a moratorium on new natural gas hookups.” In August it expanded the investigation into National Grid after businesses complained of improper refusals.\nThe Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline project, or NESE, would increase gas volumes by 400 million cubic feet per day to National Grid customers in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island. The market already consumes about 2.8 billion cubic feet per day on average.\nThe pipeline company Williams would build the $926.5 million pipeline more than 20 miles under water from a hub in New Jersey to a link off the coast of Queens.\nA study commissioned by National Grid found that using NESE would reduce net greenhouse gas emissions between 2020 and 2030. The Environmental Defense Fund, a non-governmental group, said the study was the first of its kind for a U.S. pipeline project, though it added a more complete assessment would have looked beyond 10 years.\nNESE has received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. But New York and New Jersey have both rejected crucial water quality permits for the project. Williams has since submitted amended applications to the states, but an answer may not come until mid-2020.\nThe conflict in New York comes as National Grid faces two inquiries, one by the UK government and the second by Britain’s energy market regulator, into its management of Britain’s electricity system, following a blackout that affected more than 1 million homes and businesses, as well as rail travel, particularly in London and southeast England.\nThe regulator has warned National Grid of fines if it was found to have breached its licence conditions.\nIn the U.S., regulated businesses such as gas utilities earned half of National Grid’s 3.4 billion pounds in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2019.\nJohn Bruckner, president of National Grid’s New York business, said current pipeline capacity was not sufficient to grow beyond the company’s 1.8 million customers in New York City and Long Island. Since the freeze began, 2,600 applications for new gas service covering 20,000 commercial, residential and apartment units have been halted.\nBruckner said of Cuomo’s criticism, “The governor is certainly looking out for his constituents in New York, as he should.” But he disputed the claim that National Grid was unfairly reneging on service commitments.\nFor Arora, the stand-off has altered plans for five properties under development. He said his company has re-engineered them to provide electric heat now and gas if it becomes available in future. The cost of the necessary equipment has increased by 30 percent 40 percent, he said.\n“Most people who are sane agree we want to move the state towards green energy. Most people agree on that,” he said. “But how we do it, and who we punish along the way, I think is going to determine whether we get there sooner rather than later. And this is the wrong way to do it.”\n© The Financial Times Limited 2019. All Rights Reserved.
