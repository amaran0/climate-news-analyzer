  "content": "WASHINGTON—Democrats  are not only more prone to think that global warming is happening but  they are also much more apt to worry about it than independents and  Republicans. That  partisan split emerged loud and clear when Yale University researchers  crunched a separate set of numbers from an in-depth climate change study they released in mid-October. The prospect of a looming Election Day  prompted the survey collaborators to examine what role politics play in  attitudes toward global warming. “We  always go into our research with an open mind,” Anthony Leiserowitz,  with the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, told SolveClimate  News. “These results are not a surprise because it’s a  phenomenon we’ve been witnessing for many years now.” Researchers  first noticed the parties drifting apart on this issue in 1997, he  said, adding that the gulf has widened considerably since then.As  the accompanying graphs show, 81 percent of Democrats think global  warming is happening, compared to 57 percent of independents and 47  percent of Republicans.When  asked what is causing the Earth to warm, 68 percent of Democrats  attributed it to human activities, while 51 percent of independents and  33 percent of Republicans had that same response.A  third section of the newly released numbers reveals that 78 percent of  Democrats are very or somewhat worried about global warming. That  compares to 52 percent of independents and 32 percent of Republicans.Yale’s overall 60-page report, called “Americans’ Knowledge of Climate Change,” was  funded by the National Science Foundation. Surveys of 2,030 American  adults were conducted between June 24 and July 22. The margin of  sampling error is plus or minus 2 percent.The  divide clearly has implications for the ability to pass national  legislation, Leiserowitz said, adding that the tea party and Republicans  wielded the words cap and trade as a weapon against Democrats and some  Republicans in the primaries and throughout the campaign season.“Literally,  millions of dollars are being spent to attack cap and trade and anybody  who voted for it,” he said. “This is the crazy season of the election  and the final week is especially insane.”The  Yale researcher said he was dumbfounded that a bill such as the  American Clean Energy and Security Act—which the House passed in  2009—became a wedge issue during the campaign season.“That’s  a surprise,” he said, adding that climate change never surfaces near  the top of lists that Gallup and the Pew Research Center for the People  and the Press compile after asking people to name national priorities  for Congress and the president. “Climate change is always at the bottom.  Now the economy dwarfs everything else, and that has been the case since  2008.”Polls  continue to show that most Americans support legislative action to  control carbon emissions, Leiserowitz said, but the path forward is  prickly and loaded with land-mine language.Interestingly,  a recent New York Times/CBS News poll—released just a few days  ago—reveals that a large majority of the American public wants the  majority party in Congress to choose compromise over principle. In other  words, people want senators and representatives to tackle the issues so  they can make accomplishments instead of sticking to their positions  and contributing to gridlock.Bipartisan  congressional action on curbing heat-trapping gases is still a  possibility, Leiserowitz said, but language matters. Legislators have to  avoid now-toxic terms such as “cap-and-trade system.” Instead, they need  to draw on words that can unite sparring forces around the more  neutral-sounding “energy legislation” because everybody is on board with  catch phrases such as “energy independence” and “national security.““It  isn’t a lost cause,” he concluded about prospects for Congress. “It  hasn’t become as polarized as gay marriage. There’s still a way forward.  We’ll know more come Tuesday.”\nSee Also:\nClimate IQ a Reflection of Age, Education and Party Affiliation\nMultiple Polls Reveal Overwhelming Concern about Global Warming among Americans\nPsychologists Delve Into the Paradox of U.S. Concern but Inaction on Climate Change\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
