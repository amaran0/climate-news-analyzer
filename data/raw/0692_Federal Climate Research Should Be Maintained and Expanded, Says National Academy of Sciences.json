  "title": "Federal Climate Research Should Be Maintained and Expanded, Says National Academy of Sciences",

  "content": "The main federal program that coordinates climate research has achieved major accomplishments and deserves continuing support, according to a new review by the National Academy of Sciences.\nIts analysis of the United States Global Change Research Program, which coordinates research by 13 federal agencies and departments, reads as a vigorous defense of the program’s work. It comes just as those agencies’ research faces intense scrutiny by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.\nAs the effects of climate change become even more apparent in coming years, the NAS recommended that the program “build on its accomplishments by sustaining, expanding, and coordinating observations of the Earth system and maintaining a balanced program of discovery-driven and use-inspired research to support the needs of the nation at local, regional, national, and global scales.”\nThe academy’s charter is to advise the government on sound science policies and its report comes one month into a new administration that has expressed skepticism about some of the program’s core findings. Republicans in Congress have also targeted funding for some of the research it oversees.\nPresident Donald Trump’s nominees issued a range of carefully constructed comments about climate change during their confirmation hearings, often hedging when asked about humanity’s role in driving global warming or what ought to be done in response.\nEarlier this month, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said he would like to cut NASA’s Earth science and climate change research budget.\nThe Global Change Research Program was established by law in 1990 to help oversee research into “human-induced and natural processes of global change.” Its primary activities today are to coordinate the various federal agencies involved in that research and to synthesize their findings for the public and policymakers. The program’s chief product is the National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report published every four years. The next assessment is due next year.\nOver 25 years, the program has produced an enormous body of research, much of which has had a practical impact on Americans’ lives, the new report said. Research on the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements, for example, has helped farmers use fertilizer while minimizing the environmental impacts of runoff into waterways. Work on climate change’s effects on precipitation and evaporation has led to improved drought forecasting. Other research has improved understanding of heat waves and their effects on human health, which has led to fewer deaths.\nThe program has also chronicled a substantial increase in the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation events, which are projected to continue increasing in many regions. The increase in rainfall intensity has been especially significant in the Northeast.\nThe report noted that the program faces challenges, however, including a lack of authority over the agencies it works with and “a lack of sustained funding and commitment to data resources.”\nSome former employees have expressed concerns that the Trump administration may target the program or the National Climate Assessment, according to a recent report by E&E News. In its last act on the issue, the Obama administration in December released a scientific review meant to inform the next assessment, which it said “remains a critical resource for the Nation.”\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization. We do not charge a subscription fee, lock our news behind a paywall, or clutter our website with ads. We make our news on climate and the environment freely available to you and anyone who wants it.\nThat’s not all. We also share our news for free with scores of other media organizations around the country. Many of them can’t afford to do environmental journalism of their own. We’ve built bureaus from coast to coast to report local stories, collaborate with local newsrooms and co-publish articles so that this vital work is shared as widely as possible.\nTwo of us launched ICN in 2007. Six years later we earned a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and now we run the oldest and largest dedicated climate newsroom in the nation. We tell the story in all its complexity. We hold polluters accountable. We expose environmental injustice. We debunk misinformation. We scrutinize solutions and inspire action.\nDonations from readers like you fund every aspect of what we do. If you don’t already, will you support our ongoing work, our reporting on the biggest crisis facing our planet, and help us reach even more readers in more places?\nPlease take a moment to make a tax-deductible donation. Every one of them makes a difference.\nThank you,\nDavid Sassoon\n\t\t\tFounder and Publisher\nVernon Loeb\n\t\t\tExecutive Editor\nNicholas Kusnetz is a reporter for Inside Climate News.
