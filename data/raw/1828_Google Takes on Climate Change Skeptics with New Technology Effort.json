The announcement could not have come at a more timely juncture.\nOn Monday, an annual Gallup poll on the environment reported that nearly 20 percent of Americans surveyed believe the effects of global warming will never happen, up from 11 percent three years ago, while fewer respondents are concerned about climate change than in the past.\nA day later, House Republicans in the Energy and Commerce Committee voted unanimously against three amendments offered by Democrats that would accept that climate change is occurring; that it is largely due to human activity; and that human-made warming poses a threat to public health and welfare.\nDemocrats on the panel, all of whom voted for the measures, tied the proposals to larger GOP-backed legislation seeking to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions.\nThat global warming is doubted by large swathes of the country — despite a consensus among climate scientists worldwide that says otherwise — underscores the large gap between the data and America’s understanding of it, scientists say.\n‘They’re Just Trying to Make Noise’\n“The uncertainty argument, that we really don’t know what is going on and that climate scientists are corrupt, has been reasonably effective in the last few years,” said Andrew Dessler, also a Google fellow and a climate scientist at Texas A&M University.\n“We don’t know everything about the climate from a scientific standpoint and there are uncertainties, but they are uncertainties over whether climate change is going to either be bad or really, really bad,” he told SolveClimate News.\n“People who are opposed to regulation … [are] not trying to prove that climate change [science] is wrong. They’re trying to prove that there is an argument going on,” he said. “They’re just trying to create noise.”\nHiggins of AMS said that depending on their political beliefs, lawmakers have used skepticism or affirmation of climate science to stall or advance progress on partisan policy issues — such as the EPA’s “tailoring” rules or cap-and-trade schemes for controlling greenhouse gas emissions.\nFor him, passing or rejecting the House amendments is less important than whether lawmakers actually understand climate science and are thoughtfully considering the risks of inaction.\n“If we were well informed as a society — and if  policymakers were well  informed — then they would be taking the risk that  climate change should  be taken seriously.”\nHiggins pointed out that the Google fellowship is geared just as much toward influencing those who believe that climate change poses serious consequences, but may not yet grasp the science.\n“The vast majority of people don’t know and understand the details of climate science,” he said. “The science of climate change spans 20 to 30 disciplines and sub-disciplines, at least … It is an enormous amount of information, and distilling it is a bit of a challenge.”\nKelly Levin, a senior research associate at the World Resources Institute, a conservation group, said she hoped the Google program could tackle that challenge by engaging wider audiences in the scientific discussion.\n“Given the pace and scale of human-induced climate change, it is of great importance that climate change science, and the urgency of addressing the climate change problem, is communicated effectively to the public and decision makers,” she said.\nShe added: “Involving the public more directly in the scientific process could increase the acceptance of ideas and help scientific advancements inform governmental policies.”\nA More Accessible Approach\nThroughout the year, the Google fellows will sharpen their new media  skills, learn data-sharing technologies and improve communication  strategies to lend a more accessible approach to climate science.\nFollowing  a workshop in June, fellows will have the chance to apply for grants to  support projects fostering scientific dialogue. Future participants  will take on other socially relevant topics tied to science and the  environment.\n“The public’s understanding of  science across all disciplines is extremely low, because the scientific  community is really siloed from the community in general,” Amy Luers,  Google’s senior environment program manager, told SolveClimate News.\n“If  the scientists understand [data] in a different way than the public  does, it is impossible to see how this information is going to be  integrated in the way it needs to be to make policy and management  decisions,” she said.\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization. We do not charge a subscription fee, lock our news behind a paywall, or clutter our website with ads. We make our news on climate and the environment freely available to you and anyone who wants it.\nThat’s not all. We also share our news for free with scores of other media organizations around the country. Many of them can’t afford to do environmental journalism of their own. We’ve built bureaus from coast to coast to report local stories, collaborate with local newsrooms and co-publish articles so that this vital work is shared as widely as possible.\nTwo of us launched ICN in 2007. Six years later we earned a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and now we run the oldest and largest dedicated climate newsroom in the nation. We tell the story in all its complexity. We hold polluters accountable. We expose environmental injustice. We debunk misinformation. We scrutinize solutions and inspire action.\nDonations from readers like you fund every aspect of what we do. If you don’t already, will you support our ongoing work, our reporting on the biggest crisis facing our planet, and help us reach even more readers in more places?\nPlease take a moment to make a tax-deductible donation.
