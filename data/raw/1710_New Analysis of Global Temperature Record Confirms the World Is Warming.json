  "content": "Climate skeptics’ criticisms of the evidence for global warming make  no difference to the emerging picture of a warming world, according to  the most comprehensive, independent review of historical temperature  records to date.\nScientists at the University of California,  Berkeley, investigated several key issues that skeptics claim can skew  global warming figures and found they had no meaningful effect on world  temperature trends.\nResearchers at the Berkeley Earth project compiled more than a billion temperature records dating back to the  1800s from 15 sources around the world and found that the average global  land temperature has risen by around 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-1950s.\nThis  figure agrees with the estimate of global warming arrived at by major  groups that maintain official records on the world’s climate, including NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, with the University of East Anglia, in the UK.\n“My hope is that this will win over those people who are properly skeptical,” Richard Muller, a physicist and head of the Berkeley Earth project, told the Guardian.\n“Some  people lump the properly skeptical in with the deniers and that makes  it easy to dismiss them, because the deniers pay no attention to  science. But there have been people out there who have raised legitimate  issues,” he said.\nIn the Berkeley Earth project, Muller sought to cool the debate over climate change by creating the world’s largest open database of temperature records,  with the aim of producing a transparent and independent assessment of  global warming.\nThe initial reluctance of government groups to  release all their methods and data, and the fiasco over emails from the  University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit in 2009, gave the  project added impetus.\nThe team, which includes Saul Perlmutter,  joint winner of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery  that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, has submitted four  papers to the journal Geophysical Research Letters that describe their work to date.\nGoing  public with results before they are peer-reviewed is not standard  practice, but Muller said the decision to circulate the papers before  publication was part of a long-standing academic tradition of  sanity-checking results with colleagues. “We will get much more feedback  from making these papers public before publication,” he said.\nClimate  skeptics have criticized official global warming figures on the grounds  that many temperature stations are poor quality, based largely in  cities, and that data are tweaked by hand. However, the Berkeley study  found that the so-called urban heat island effect, which makes cities warmer than surrounding rural areas, is  locally large and real, but does not contribute significantly to average  land temperature rises. This is because urban regions make up less than  1% of the Earth’s land area.\nAnd while stations considered “poor” might be less accurate, they recorded the same average warming trend.\n“We  have looked at these issues in a straightforward, transparent way, and  based on that, I would expect legitimate skeptics to feel their issues  have been addressed,” Muller said.\nNevertheless, one prominent U.S. climate skeptic, Anthony Watts,  claimed to have identified a “basic procedural error” concerning time  periods used in the research, and urged the authors to revise the paper.\nJames Hansen, head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies,  told the Guardian he had not read the research papers but was glad  Muller was looking at the issue, describing him as “a top-notch  physicist.”\n“It should help inform those who have honest  skepticism about global warming,” said Hansen. “Of course, presuming  that he basically confirms what we have been reporting, the deniers will  then decide that he is a crook or has some ulterior motive. As I have  discussed in the past, the deniers, or contrarians, if you will, do not  act as scientists, but rather as lawyers. As soon as they see evidence  against their client (the fossil fuel industry and those people making  money off business-as-usual), they trash that evidence and bring forth  whatever tidbits they can find to confuse the judge and jury.”\nPeter Thorne at the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative,  said: “This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up  with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing  estimates are in the right ballpark. There is very substantial value in  having multiple groups looking at the same problem in different ways.\n“Openness and transparency is a must, particularly now with climate change being so politicized, but more to the point, with the huge socioeconomic decisions that rest on it.”\nPhil Jones, the director of the Climatic Research Unit at UEA who was at the center of the Climategate incident, said: “I look  forward to reading the finalized paper once it has been reviewed and  published. These initial findings are very encouraging and echo our own  results and our conclusion that the impact of urban heat islands on the  overall global temperature is minimal.”\nSome scientists were critical of the project and Muller’s decision to release the papers before they had been peer reviewed. Peter Cox, professor of climate system dynamics at Exeter University said: “These studies seem to confirm the global warming estimated from  the existing datasets, which is pleasing but not exactly a surprise to  those of us who know how carefully the existing datasets are put  together.\n“It is surprising, however, that the authors believe  that this news is so significant that they can’t wait for peer review,  especially when their conclusions aren’t exactly revolutionary.”\nThe  Berkeley Earth project has been attacked by some climate bloggers, who  point out that one of the funders is linked to Koch Industries, a  company Greenpeace called a “financial kingpin of climate science denial.”\nMuller  points out the project is organized under the auspices of Novim, a  Santa Barbara-based nonprofit organization that uses science to find  answers to the most pressing issues facing society and to publish them  “without advocacy or agenda.”\nOther donors include the Fund for  Innovative Climate and Energy Research (funded by Bill Gates), and the  Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley Lab. The next phase of the  project will focus on warming trends in the oceans.\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
