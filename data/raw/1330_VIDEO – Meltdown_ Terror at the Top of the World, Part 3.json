  "content": "More than a year ago, InsideClimate News set out to tell the story of seven American hikers who went on a wilderness adventure into Canada’s Arctic and came back with a harrowing story after one of them was brutally attacked by a polar bear.\nThe result was “Meltdown: Terror at the Top of the World,” an e-book we released last month.\nAs part of the project, ICN reporter Sabrina Shankman returned to the site of the attack with VICE, ICN’s partner in the project, to explore how climate change is wreaking havoc on the polar bear population.\nHere is Part 3 of the Vice documentary video, “Polar Bear Man.”  Watch Part 1. Watch Part 2.\nRead a free excerpt of Meltdown here.
