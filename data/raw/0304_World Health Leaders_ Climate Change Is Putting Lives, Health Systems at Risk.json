  "content": "Climate change poses an emerging global health crisis with impacts that will only worsen as the planet continues to warm, a group of international health experts wrote Wednesday in a global assessment for The Lancet, a prominent medical journal. They warn that the world’s slow progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is putting lives and the health care systems people depend on at risk.\nThe report, a collaboration by leading doctors, researchers and policy professionals from international organizations including the World Health Organization, says heat waves and infectious diseases pose two of the greatest immediate threats, particularly for outdoor workers, elderly people in urban areas, and other vulnerable populations.\nThe conclusions reinforce many of the findings spelled out in the Fourth National Climate Assessment, released last week by 13 U.S. government agencies.\n“Climate change is a dire health crisis,” said Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of a U.S. policy brief that accompanied the Lancet report. “If we don’t start taking these preventative measures, mitigating the greenhouse gas pollution that is choking us every day, many more Americans will continue to suffer and die.”\nPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.\nThe “Countdown” report, Lancet’s second annual look at the health impacts of climate change, analyzed dozens of health indicators around the globe. Its top conclusions:\nThe report found that 153 billion work hours were lost in 2017 due to extreme heat, a leading symptom of climate change and a significant increase from 2000. In India, the loss was equivalent to an entire year’s work for 7 percent of the country’s total working population.\nThe number of vulnerable people subjected to heat waves increased by 157 million people from 2000 to 2017, and rising temperatures also fueled the spread of infectious diseases including malaria and dengue fever, the report said.\n“Outside the craziness of D.C., in the real world you don’t have to look very far to see that climate change is real,” said Gina McCarthy, a former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard School of Public Health, who served as an advisor for the U.S. policy brief. “It threatens our health and our safety today.”\nHealth professionals are seeing new risks to human health, include antibiotic-resistant bacteria, impaired cognition for students in overheated classrooms, and mental health problems including increased suicide, Salas said.\nAnother emerging concern is the potential for increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to reduce the nutritional quality of crops that people rely on for food. “The potential impact of that is incredibly large,” said Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and an author of the report. There could be “hundreds of millions of people potentially affected by that change.”\nLyndsay Moseley Alexander of the American Lung Association said the report “helps to highlight that, because we are not taking action to reduce all of the pollution that comes, for example, from coal-fired power plants, we are suffering the health impacts now.”\nThe report notes, for example, that from 2010 to 2016, air pollution concentrations worsened in almost 70 percent of the world’s cities. In 2015, pollution involving fine particulate matter resulted in more than 2.9 million premature deaths, it said.\nAlexander served as a reviewer for the package’s U.S. policy brief, which called for increased funding for the health care sector to address issues related to heat waves and the spread of infectious disease. It also called on hospitals and other health care facilities to transition to renewable energy and divest from fossil fuels.\n“The news seems grim,” said Juanita Constible, a senior advocate for climate and health with the Natural Resources Defense Council, “but we actually have the power to make the future we want rather than just accept that future that we are currently on track for.”\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization. We do not charge a subscription fee, lock our news behind a paywall, or clutter our website with ads. We make our news on climate and the environment freely available to you and anyone who wants it.\nThat’s not all. We also share our news for free with scores of other media organizations around the country. Many of them can’t afford to do environmental journalism of their own. We’ve built bureaus from coast to coast to report local stories, collaborate with local newsrooms and co-publish articles so that this vital work is shared as widely as possible.\nTwo of us launched ICN in 2007. Six years later we earned a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and now we run the oldest and largest dedicated climate newsroom in the nation. We tell the story in all its complexity. We hold polluters accountable. We expose environmental injustice. We debunk misinformation. We scrutinize solutions and inspire action.\nDonations from readers like you fund every aspect of what we do.
