The region has nearly twice as much mercury as all other soils, the ocean and the atmosphere combined, according to a new study published Monday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\nThat’s significantly more than previously known, and it carries risks for humans and wildlife.\n“It really blew us away,” said Paul Schuster, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado, and lead author of the study.\nMercury (which is both a naturally occurring element and is produced by the burning of fossil fuels) is trapped in the permafrost, a frozen layer of earth that contains thousands of years worth of organic carbon, like plants and animal carcasses. As temperatures climb and that ground thaws, what has been frozen within it begins to decompose, releasing gases like methane and carbon dioxide, as well as other long dormant things like anthrax, ancient bacteria and viruses—and mercury.\n“The mercury that ends up being released as a result of the thaw will make its way up into the atmosphere or through the fluvial systems via rivers and streams and wetlands and lakes and even groundwater,” said Schuster. “Sooner or later, all the water on land ends up in the ocean.”\nThough the study focused on the magnitude of mercury in the North, Schuster said that’s just half the story. “The other half is: ‘How does it get into the food web?’” he said.\nMercury is a bioaccumulator, meaning that, up the food chain, species absorb higher and higher concentrations. That could be particularly dangerous for native people in the Arctic who hunt and fish for their food.\nExposure to even small amounts of mercury can cause serious health effects and poses particular risks to human development.\n“Food sources are important to the spiritual and cultural health of the natives, so this study has major health and economic implications for this region of the world,” said Edda Mutter, science director for the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council.\nThe mercury risk won’t be isolated in the Arctic either. Once in the ocean, Schuster said, it’s possible that fisheries around the world could eventually see spikes in mercury content. He plans to seek to a better understand of this and other impacts from the mercury in subsequent studies.\nThe permafrost in parts of the Arctic is already starting to thaw. The Arctic Council reported last year that the permafrost temperature had risen by .5 degrees Celsius in just the last decade. If emissions continue at their current rate, two-thirds of the Northern Hemisphere’s near-surface permafrost could thaw by 2080.\nThe new study is the first to quantify just how much mercury is in the permafrost. Schuster and his co-authors relied on 13 permafrost soil cores, which they extracted from across Alaska between 2004 and 2012. They also compiled 11,000 measurements of mercury in soil from other studies to calculate total mercury across the Northern Hemisphere.\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization. We do not charge a subscription fee, lock our news behind a paywall, or clutter our website with ads. We make our news on climate and the environment freely available to you and anyone who wants it.\nThat’s not all. We also share our news for free with scores of other media organizations around the country. Many of them can’t afford to do environmental journalism of their own. We’ve built bureaus from coast to coast to report local stories, collaborate with local newsrooms and co-publish articles so that this vital work is shared as widely as possible.\nTwo of us launched ICN in 2007. Six years later we earned a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and now we run the oldest and largest dedicated climate newsroom in the nation. We tell the story in all its complexity. We hold polluters accountable. We expose environmental injustice. We debunk misinformation. We scrutinize solutions and inspire action.\nDonations from readers like you fund every aspect of what we do. If you don’t already, will you support our ongoing work, our reporting on the biggest crisis facing our planet, and help us reach even more readers in more places?\nPlease take a moment to make a tax-deductible donation. Every one of them makes a difference.\nThank you,\nDavid Sassoon\n\t\t\tFounder and Publisher\nVernon Loeb\n\t\t\tExecutive Editor\nSabrina Shankman is a reporter for InsideClimate News focusing on the Arctic.
