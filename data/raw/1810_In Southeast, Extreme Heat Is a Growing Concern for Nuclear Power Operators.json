  "content": "On July 8, 2010, as the temperature in downtown Decatur, Alabama, climbed to a sweltering 98 degrees Fahrenheit, operators at the Browns Ferry nuclear power plant a few miles outside of town realized they had only  one option to avoid violating their environmental permit: turn down the  reactors.\nFor days, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which owns the nuclear plant, had kept a watchful eye on the  rising mercury, knowing that more heat outside could spell trouble  inside the facility. When the Tennessee River, whose adjacent waters are  used to cool the reactors, finally hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit and forced Browns Ferry to  run at only half of its regular power output, the TVA hoped the hot  spell would last just a few days.\nEight weeks of unrelenting heat later, the plant was still running at  half its capacity, robbing the grid of power it desperately needed when  electricity demand from air conditions and fans was at its peak.\nThe  total cost of the lost power over that time? More than $50 million, all of which was paid for by TVA’s customers in Tennessee.\n“Last summer, the water in the Tennessee River warmed up early and  stayed warm,” says TVA spokesman Ray Golden. “When it got hot again in  July and August, we were impacted by that and had to reduce power at the  plant and get it from somewhere else.”\nWith river water so warm, the nuclear plant couldn’t draw in as much  water as usual to cool the facility’s three reactors, or else the water  it pumped back into the river could be hot enough to harm the local  ecosystem, says Golden.\nBut for every day that the Browns Ferry plant  ran at 50 percent of its maximum output, the TVA had to spend $1 million  more than usual to purchase power from somewhere else, he says.\nNo Threat of Meltdown, But Hefty Fines\nWhat happened in northern Alabama last summer, at the largest of TVA’s  nuclear power plants, did not present a human safety concern. Operators  knew there was never a risk of an explosion or nuclear meltdown, nor was  there a threat of leaking radioactive material.\nBut the prolonged spell  of hot weather put the TVA at risk of violating environmental permits,  with hefty fines as one consequence and potential harm to the Tennessee  River ecosystem as another.\nIt’s not the first time high temperatures have affected the performance  of the Browns Ferry plant, and extreme heat is a growing concern for  power plant operators across the Southeast. While some nuclear plants  can improve their cooling procedures to cope with the intake of warmer  water, the upgrades can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and still  don’t offer an indefinite defense against extreme heat.\nBecause  scientists say the Southeast (like many other parts of the world) can  expect to see more frequent and intense heat waves by the end of this century, the problems for nuclear power and the  people that rely on it for electricity may only be beginning.\nExtreme Heat Limits Nuclear Energy Production\nThe disaster still unfolding at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant  has refocused America’s attention on nuclear power, calling into  question its future role in the country’s energy portfolio.\nMany  advocates of nuclear power say that we need to maintain — and even  expand — nuclear power to get away from using fossil fuels such as  coal, and to help lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut nuclear power has a paradoxical relationship with climate change.  Even though it might help mitigate long-term global warming, nuclear  power is already being challenged by rising temperatures and the  increasing number of heat waves around the world. Throughout the last  decade, several plants have had to reduce electricity production during  heat waves, just when electricity demand typically reaches peak  levels.\n“It’s a dilemma between mitigation of climate change and adaptation to  it,” says Natalie Kopytko, an energy policy doctoral student at the  University of York in England. Having recently studied the ways in which  climate change could have a negative impact on nuclear power,  she says nuclear power is caught in the middle because it could be used  to help lower greenhouse gas emissions, but global warming is making  the technology less effective at providing electricity.\nMost nuclear power plants draw water from nearby sources to help cool  the reactors. Several American plants are on the coast and rely on ocean  water, but the vast majority of nuclear reactors in this country (89 of  the total 104) are inland, next to freshwater sources, and many of  these are constantly cycling through river or lake water.\nNormally,  there isn’t much difference between the water cooling process of inland  and coastal facilities, but when hot weather strikes, a slow-moving and  shallow river or a lake heats up a lot quicker than the ocean does. And  when a nuclear power plant is drawing in such warm water, it can end up  releasing unusually hot water back into the river. That’s because the  water gains heat while cycling through the plant.\nLaws to Ensure Water Temps at Safe Levels\nPower companies like the TVA can’t control the weather. Nevertheless,  plant operators are bound by environmental guidelines that are meant to  keep temperatures at a safe level for fish in the river. For example,  the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) stipulates Browns Ferry cannot release water back into the Tennessee River that is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\n“I know this past summer the TVA was worried about exceeding their  permits,” says Scott Hughes from the ADEM. “But they adjusted their  operations and stayed within the limits.”\nThe 90 degree Fahrenheit ceiling has been especially problematic for the TVA because in  the past five years, the river water has, on several occasions, warmed  that much on its own. And each time, Browns Ferry has been forced to  reduce electricity production. This puts a pinch in the electricity  supply for the more than 2.1 million homes and businesses that depend on  electricity from Browns Ferry.\nMore importantly, the problem gets  transferred to the pocketbooks of TVA’s customers.\n“When we can’t generate that power from our nuclear plant, we have to  go elsewhere in the energy market to get it,” says the TVA’s Golden. “In  some cases, we have to increase the production from some of our other  plants, including coal plants, and in other cases we go to other  companies and buy power.”\nIn addition to finding power from other sources, last summer the TVA called upon its customers to cut down on their electricity use throughout July and August. But  the request came at the hottest time of the year, when electricity  demand is usually at its highest.\nOther large-scale power plants, including coal and biomass plants, are  also vulnerable to heat waves and are subject to the same kind of  environmental permits for hot water.\nBut according to the TVA’s Golden,  while “it is also a problem for coal-fired power plants, the size of  nuclear power plants is much larger so the cooling problem is bigger.”  That’s because cooling at many nuclear power plants isn’t as efficient as at coal-fired power plants, and the nuclear power plants usually  require more water for their cooling than other types of plants.\nHeat Waves in Southeast on the Rise\nWhat happened last summer at Browns Ferry may be a sign of what people  living in the Southeast can expect in the future. As average global  temperatures rise, studies show the risk of heat waves also increases.  New research suggests extreme heat will become a more regular occurrence  across the U.S.\n“One of the things that is happening is that the heat wave season, the  time over which heat waves might occur, is actually getting longer,”  says Kenneth Kunkel, a climate scientist from the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in  North Carolina. “Consequently, you can get heat waves a lot earlier in  the year, and the season can also extend a lot longer.”\nKunkel and his colleagues have recently modeled the  future of heat waves across the United States, depending on what global  greenhouse gas emissions are like during the rest of this century. In  the Southeast, they found that by 2100, every year there could be  between 60 and 80 more days with heat wave-level temperatures than there  are currently. More frequent heat waves will mean higher Tennessee  River water temperatures.\nA separate Climate Central analysis shows similar trends for the  region. For example, each summer between June and September, there is an  average of 44 days when the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Athens, Ala., a  location nearby to the Browns Ferry nuclear power plant. By the end of  the century, however, Athens should expect to see about 80 summer days  above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThat 80-day estimate is based on a future climate scenario  with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions; if atmospheric carbon  dioxide emissions continue to climb at the current rate or higher,  Athens could see even more of those exceptionally hot days.\n“It may be that humans are able to adapt to the higher temperatures,”  says Kunkel, “but of course, a nuclear power plant is just going to have  to deal with the conditions.”\nWhen Nuclear is Primary, Extreme Heat Can Hit Hard\nThe vulnerability of nuclear power to heat waves isn’t restricted to  the Southeast. In the summer of 2003, during a record-breaking heat wave  in Western Europe, millions of people across France and Italy suffered  through an extended power shortage after the French network of 19 nuclear power plants had to reduce their  operations.\nIn France, over 70 percent of the country’s electricity  comes from nuclear power, and Italy also purchases about a third of its  electricity from French nuclear providers.\nDuring the heat wave, France took some of the pressure off its  electrical grid by purchasing power from other sources, promoting energy  conservation among citizens and industry, and by exporting less to  Italy — causing many Italian towns to endure blackouts.\nAlthough the energy shortage can’t be solely blamed for the thousands  of heat wave-related deaths in France and Italy that summer, it put a  strain on people who lost air conditioning, as well as hospitals.\nIn Illinois, where a larger portion of electricity comes from nuclear  power than any other state, plants have also fallen prey to summer heat  waves. Back in 1988, which featured an unusually hot and dry summer,  several reactors were reduced to just one-third of their maximum power  output during a 90-day bout of abnormally hot weather.\nBut while inland nuclear power plants everywhere are threatened by heat  waves, the dilemma may be growing worse in the Southeast.\nLast summer  was the hottest on record for the region. An early season heat wave in  May warmed the Tennessee River more than usual for that time of year.  And then more hot weather settled in a few months later and sent water  temperatures soaring; August 4, 2010 marked the hottest single day in  the TVA region in more than 50 years — temperatures in Nashville climbed  as high as 111°F, for example.\nThe power lost at Browns Ferry during the late summer heat wave of 2010  was enough to catch the TVA’s attention. In late August, the company  decided to invest in more cooling infrastructure at their biggest  nuclear power plant.\n“At Browns Ferry, we’re spending about $160 million  on retrofits to improve the cooling,” says Golden. “It’s an awful lot  of money but the project should pay for itself in just a few short years  — especially if there are more heat waves.”\nThe upgrade has added a  larger cooling tower to the nuclear plant than the one originally there, which helps bring  down the temperature of the water before it is sent back into the river.  A few more similar improvements will be made in the next two years,  says Golden.\nOther power companies may have to explore similar options in the years  to come. Installing better cooling to combat high water temperatures,  and designing more efficient closed-loop systems that don’t constantly  demand fresh water are technically feasible, says Golden, but they could  prove to be prohibitively expensive upgrades for older power plants.\nThe Browns Ferry upgrades will be enough to combat heat waves similar  to those seen in 2010. Whether they are able to withstand the earlier  and more intense heat waves of the future, on the other hand, isn’t something the TVA can tell just  yet. The repairs may end up being just a short-term solution for a  long-term problem the nuclear industry is facing.\nSenior Scientist Claudia Tebaldi conducted heat wave calculations for this story.\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
