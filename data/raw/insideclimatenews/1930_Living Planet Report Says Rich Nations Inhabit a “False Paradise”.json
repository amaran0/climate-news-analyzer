  "content": "Populations of tropical species are plummeting and humanity’s demands on natural resources are sky-rocketing to 50% more than the earth can sustain, according to the 2010 edition of WWF’s Living Planet Report – the leading survey of the health of the earth.\nThe WWF study — produced in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London and the Global Footprint Network —  uses what it terms “a series of indicators to monitor biodiversity,  human demand on renewable resources and ecosystem services”.\nThis “Living Planet Index” reflects changes in ecosystems by  tracking trends in nearly 8,000 populations of vertebrate species —  more than 2,500 species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and  amphibians. The global index, says the report, shows a 30%  decrease from 1970 to 2007; the tropics have been hardest hit, with a  60% decline in less than 40 years.\n“There is an alarming rate of biodiversity loss in low-income,  often tropical, countries while the developed world is living in a false  paradise, fuelled by excessive consumption and high carbon emissions,”  according to Jim Leape, director general of WWF International.\nTracked  populations of freshwater tropical species have fallen by nearly 70%,  the report says – “greater than any species’ decline measured on land or  in our oceans”.\nOn a more positive note, some “promising recovery” by species’  populations in temperate areas was found, partly due to greater  conservation efforts and improvements in pollution and waste control.\n“Species are the foundation of ecosystems,” noted Jonathan  Baillie, conservation programme director with the Zoological Society of  London. “Healthy ecosystems form the basis of all we have – lose them  and we destroy our life-support system.”\nA second indicator of the planet’s health, the ecological footprint,  tracks human demand on ecosystems by measuring the area of biologically  productive land and water required to provide the renewable resources  people use and to absorb the carbon dioxide waste that human activities  generate. Latest measurements show that human demand on  natural resources has doubled since 1966 and that humans are using the  equivalent of 1.5 planets to support their activities. By 2030, if we  continue to live beyond the earth’s limits, the equivalent of two  planets’ productive capacity will be needed annually.\nLeape sees a continuation of current consumption trends as  leading the world “to the point of no return”. If the whole world lived  like the average resident of the United States, he said, “4.5 Earths would be required”. An alarming 11-fold increase in humanity’s carbon footprint over the last five decades means carbon now accounts for more than half the global ecological footprint.\nThe 10 biggest culprit-nations – those with the largest ecological footprints – are: the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Denmark, Belgium, the United States, Estonia, Canada, Australia, Kuwait and Ireland.\nAccounting for nearly 40% of the global footprint, the report  says, are the 31 countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD), which includes the world’s richest countries. There are twice as many people living in the so-called BRIC countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – and the current rate of  per-person footprint in those countries puts them on a trajectory to  overtake the OECD if they follow the same development path.\nMathis Wackernagel, president of the Global Footprint Network, argues  that countries put their own economies at risk by maintaining high  levels of resource dependence. “Those countries that are able to  provide the highest quality of life on the lowest amount of ecological  demand will not only serve the global interest,” he said, “they will be  the leaders in a resource-constrained world.”\nA high footprint and high level of consumption, which often  comes at the cost of others, is not reflected in a higher level of  development, the WWF report shows. (Countries with moderate footprints  can rank well according to the UN Human Development Index, reflecting life expectancy, income and educational attainment.)\nOutlining solutions needed to ensure the earth can sustain a global population projected to exceed nine billion in 2050, the report points to choices in diet and energy consumption as critical to reducing footprint, as well as improved efforts to value and invest in natural capital.\n“The challenge posed by the Living Planet Report is  clear,” said Leape. “Somehow we need to find a way to meet the needs of a  growing and increasingly prosperous population within the resources of  this one planet. All of us have to find a way to make better choices in  what we consume and how we produce and use energy.”\n(Republished with permission)\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
