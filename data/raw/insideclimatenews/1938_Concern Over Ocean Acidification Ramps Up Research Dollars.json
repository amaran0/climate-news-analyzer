  "content": "Mounting  concerns over ocean acidification—a consequence of CO2 emissions—has  accelerated research funding aimed at understanding the process potentially endangering marine life in ocean waters all across the earth.In  early October, the National Science Foundation awarded over $24 million  dollars to 22 projects through a new grant program targeted to study  how ocean acidification affects marine environments. While the NSF has  funded ocean acidification in the past, it is the first time the agency  has created a special program aimed at the field of study.As  CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increase, much of the gas is  absorbed by the oceans, where it dissolves in the water. As a result,  the oceans are getting more acidic over time. However, the long-term  effects of the process are poorly understood.\n“There  are serious concerns about ocean acidification, and that’s why this  research is being conducted,” Phillip Taylor, Head of the Ocean Section  in NSF’s Ocean Sciences Division, told SolveClimate News. “There are  many who think this is going to have an impact on important animals in  the sea that are instrumental in driving the productivity of ocean  waters.”Ocean  acidification threatens the growth of corals, clams and other organisms  at the bottom of the food chain. These changes could trigger a domino  effect throughout the oceanic ecosystem.The  funded projects investigate a variety of topics, such as modeling the  rate of future acidification, studying how organisms behave in lowered  pH and looking at earth history to understand how current trends may  progress.What the Science Says So FarOne  recipient of the new grants was Bärbel Hönisch, a paleoceanographer and  assistant professor at Columbia University. Hönisch is using boron isotopes to reconstruct how the oceans’ pH has changed   with time; she hopes that past trends will shed light on the changes to   come.\n“All of [this funding] is  meant to get a better idea of what’s going to happen in the ocean—what  can be expected for the ecology and economy,” she said.The  pH of the modern oceans is 8.1. Since the Industrial Revolution, the  oceans’ pH has dropped by 0.1 and is expected to drop another 0.2-0.3 by  2100, said Hönisch. Those  changes may not sound like a lot, but pH is measured on a logarithmic  scale, so a 0.1 difference is equivalent to a 30% change in acidity or  alkalinity. “When you change the pH of water, it has very clear and  potentially immediate affects on the physiology of organisms,” Taylor  said. One  effect of ocean acidification is to decrease the availability of  carbonate ions in the water, an important compound for organisms like  corals, shellfish and foraminifera that use carbonate to build their  calcium carbonate shells. These shells are part of the organisms’ body  structure; they provide shape, size and protection against predators. “There  are serious questions about what the food chain impacts will be,” said  Taylor. In particular, pteropods—a major food source for salmon—depend  on calcium carbonate shells. The larvae of sea urchins, mussels and  crabs could also be affected. Study: Lower Survival RatesA paper published Oct. 5 in the science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed  just how serious the consequences could be. The first examination of  how ocean acidification of the past 200 years has affected marine  shellfish, the study revealed that bivalve shellfish larvae survive to  become juvenile shellfish about half as frequently in water with current  CO2 levels as they do in water with preindustrial CO2 levels.Christopher  Gobler, an associate professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric  Sciences at Stony Brook University, and his colleagues raised two  species of bivalve shellfish larvae in different CO2 concentrations. One  group was placed in water with 250 parts per million of dissolved CO2  to mimic preindustrial conditions, and another group was grown in  concentrations of 390 ppm, or present-day levels. A third were placed in  water with CO2 concentrations of 1500 parts per million—an extreme  case.Over  the 40-day experiment, the organisms grew from shell-less embryos to  juveniles with actual calcium carbonate shells. The ones that grew in  lower CO2 concentrations ended up with larger, thicker shells. Shellfish  survival rates under 250 ppm were nearly double that of 390 ppm. Very  few shellfish survived in 1500 ppm waters.The  larval stage is particularly important because that’s when the  shellfish are most sensitive, said Gobler: “It looks like even small  changes in the availability of carbonate has a big impact at [the  larval] stage.” The  next step is to see how the shellfish might adapt, said Gobler. When  animals are faced with stress, they can move, adapt or die out. Since  ocean acidification is a global phenomenon, changing habitat isn’t an  option. Shellfish will either adapt to higher CO2 levels or go extinct.A Need for SpeedTo  survive, they’ll have to adapt fast. Many modern shellfish evolved  about 20 million years ago, four million years after the last time  atmospheric CO2 levels were as high as they are today. “There is a possibility [the shellfish] can adapt quickly,” Gobler said. “We just don’t know.”  While  there have been times in Earth’s past when atmospheric CO2 reached  current concentrations, those changes happened over thousands of years.  Today’s aquatic organisms have much less time to adjust.“In  many ways you can say climate change is happening all the time, and  species are changing constantly,” said Columbia’s Hönisch. “It’s just  happening so quickly right now.” An executive order signed into  action in July mirrors this increasing awareness of the need to monitor ocean health. The policy for the  Stewardship of the Ocean, Coasts and Great Lakes aims to improve ocean management through  integrated, ecosystem-based planning for conservation and multiple-use  areas.\n“[I think the new policy] is an indication that people in the  science realm and policy makers and the public think this is a serious  problem,” said NSF’s Taylor. “I think we’ll see [ocean acidification] elevated in priority  very soon.”See Also:\nNew Film on Ocean Acidification Reveals Unseen Face of CO2 Pollution\nIncreasing Ocean Acidification Is Tipping Fragile Balances within Marine Ecosystems\nBad and Getting Worse: Surge in CO2 Emissions Damaging World’s Oceans\nBad Acid Trip: How CO2 Could Kill the Oceans\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
