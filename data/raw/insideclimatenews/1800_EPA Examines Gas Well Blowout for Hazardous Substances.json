  "content": "WASHINGTON—Regulators said on Tuesday they have asked  Chesapeake Energy to give information on any hazardous substances  released by a Pennsylvania natural gas well that blew out last week.\nThe regional U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asked for  details, including sources of the discharge and the extent of  environmental damage.\n“We want a complete accounting of operations at the site to determine  our next steps in this incident and to help prevent future releases of  this kind,” said Shawn Garvin, the EPA regional administrator.\nThe EPA said it requested the information on Friday about fluids used  at the well in hydraulic fracturing, which is also known as fracking.  Pennsylvania is taking the lead in investigating the blow out (read EPA’s letter to Chesapeake).\nChesapeake said it intends to comply with EPA’s request and has  already communicated with the agency about its response to the incident.  Chesapeake is one of the gas producers that voluntarily reveals the  fracking fluids it has used at completed wells (see FracFocus, chemical disclosure registry).\nThe EPA is conducting a two-year study on the safety of fracking and  its impact on drinking water. Initial results of the peer-reviewed study  are expected in late 2012.\nIn fracking, drillers blast water, chemicals and sand deep underground to break rocks and release natural gas.\nThe EPA also asked Chesapeake whether radiological compounds were  present in the fluids or sediment generated as part of the development  of the well and effects on any drinking water supplies.\nChesapeake, one of Pennsylvania’s biggest shale gas producers, last  week suspended all seven of its fracking operations in the state after  the incident released thousands of gallons of drilling fluid into the  surrounding area.\nOn Monday Chesapeake said it replaced a damaged wellhead and gained  control of the well that gushed the fluids. Since the well blow out on  April 19, Chesapeake shares have risen 3 percent, mirroring a similar  rise in the S&P 500.\nThe U.S. EPA said its information request was authorized under the Clean Water Act and other statutes.\nOne analyst said the federal government may keep a close eye on  fracking operations after Congressional hearings questioned the quality  of the oversight.\n“Enhanced oversight from the federal EPA is to be expected,”  Christine Tezak, an energy policy analyst at Robert W. Baird and Co,  said in a research note on Tuesday.\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
