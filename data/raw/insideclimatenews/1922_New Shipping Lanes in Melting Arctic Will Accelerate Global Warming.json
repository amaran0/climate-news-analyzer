  "title": "New Shipping Lanes in Melting Arctic Will Accelerate Global Warming",

  "content": "In  the next few decades, a warming Arctic will open up shorter shipping routes, potentially reducing the amount of fuel needed to travel between ports. But the increased amount of soot in the atmosphere could further accelerate the region’s climate change, and the shorter distances won’t generate enough fuel savings to offset the impact.\nThose are the key findings of a recent study published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. This  new study is the first systematic analysis of how Arctic shipping could  affect local climate.\nAbout 15,000 ship trips occur in the Arctic  region (north of 60° latitude) each year, but they comprise a small  fraction of global shipping. Melting sea ice could create ice-free  passages by 2030 and create shortcuts for global trade. Two of the most  anticipated routes are the Northwest Passage linking Japan to eastern  Canada, and the Northeast Passage along Russia’s northern coast, which  would connect China with Europe.\nIncreased  ship traffic will bring additional air pollution to the Arctic. Of  particular concern is black carbon, a form of particulate matter emitted  through the burning of fossil fuels.\n“Black  carbon is—in my opinion—the second leading cause of global warming  after carbon dioxide,” said Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, who was not involved in  the study.\nToday’s  shipping industry produces 42 million tons of carbon dioxide annually,  versus only 4 million tons of black carbon. But the cumulative effects of  black carbon can add substantially to those of carbon dioxide from  Arctic ships: over a short-term period such as 20 years, one ton of  black carbon emitted in the Arctic can produce a similar warming effect  as 4,000–7,000 tons of carbon dioxide, James Corbett, the study’s lead  author, told SolveClimate News. Corbett is a professor of marine policy in the College of  Earth, Ocean and Environment at the University of Delaware.\nShort-Lived But Potent Pollutant\nBlack  carbon warms the earth in two ways. First, atmospheric black carbon  absorbs sunlight and heats up the air around it. Particles of black  carbon can also fall to the ground and accelerate melting by decreasing  albedo, or surface reflectivity. Ice and snow reflect much more sunlight  than the ocean, so the more ice that melts, the more water there is to  absorb heat. The result, said Jacobson, is a positive feedback loop that  will speed up Arctic warming.\nUnlike  carbon dioxide, which can remain in the atmosphere for 100 years, a  single particle of black carbon rarely lasts more than three weeks before  it’s rained out of the atmosphere and deposited on the ground. (The one  exception is black carbon emitted by planes that fly over the Arctic;  the planes fly in a higher level of the atmosphere called the  stratosphere, where the air is more stable. As a result, stratospheric  black carbon can last for months or even years.)\nHowever, Corbett  said, the cumulative effect of ground emissions provides a  continuous source of black carbon that’s transported from populated  places like Europe to the Arctic, and the emissions will only increase  as sea lanes open up.\nAlthough  the new routes would cut down on ships’ CO2 emissions, those reductions  would be offset by the effects of black carbon, said Corbett. “It won’t  benefit the Arctic…[because the black carbon emissions] would be in a  place where you would least want them.”\nThe  Arctic is particularly sensitive to climate change. While global  temperatures have risen by an average of 0.7° C due to anthropogenic  warming, the Arctic has warmed 2.0-2.5° C.\n“Those  ships will be emitting black carbon pollution right near the glaciers  and the sea ice where they can do the most damage,” said David Marshall, senior council for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit committed to  air quality and climate issues. The Task Force helped support Corbett’s  work but Marshall did not work directly with the study’s authors.\nMarshall  called the study “the most up-to-date survey of shipping emissions in  the Arctic.” He believes the research “can provide a firm foundation for  policy makers trying to assess the impact of those emissions.”\nGrowth Rate Influences Emissions Scenarios\nCorbett  and his colleagues began by producing an inventory of emissions from  the 15,000 ship trips that occur annually in the Arctic. They used data  from the year 2004, which came out of the Arctic Marine Shipping  Assessment, an international study that catalogued the vessels based on  type, fuel source and estimated emissions.\nThe  next step was to model future scenarios for Arctic shipping: one  involved a “business as usual” growth, and a second envisioned a fast expansion in the shipping industry.\nUnder the fast-growth scenario, by 2030 the addition of black carbon emissions could increase the warming potential of the Arctic ships’ CO2 by 17 percent to 78 percent.\nCorbett  cautioned that more research is needed to refine these numbers. What’s  more important is the potential for mitigation: in both scenarios, the  researchers projected that control measures based on current technology  could reduce black carbon-caused warming by 90 percent.\nSimilar reductions are being seen with technologies already being used in passenger vehicles,  said Jacobson. New cars and buses often come equipped with traps that  cut down on black carbon emissions by over 90 percent.\nStill, Jacobson said, “it’s probably not a technological issue.” The real key lies in policy.\nOver  the past 3 years, Congress has seen four proposed laws on reducing  black carbon. Two of the bills (The Arctic Climate Preservation Act and  the Black Carbon Research Bill) never became law. Another bill  (HR1760)—the Black Carbon Emissions Reduction Act of 2009—is being  reviewed by the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment. The only  successful bill was passed in 2009; it requires the EPA to research  methods of reducing black carbon emissions.\nCorbett  hopes that his research will demonstrate the potential of mitigation.  “[By adding] a controlled emission pathway like we have—it also adds to  the value of future analysis,” said Corbett. “Policy makers can  immediately ask the question ‘Would policy and intervention help?'”\nSee Also:\nCommercial Space Tourism May Spike Black Carbon Emissions\n‘Black Carbon’ Crackdown Offers Fast-Action Solution to Slow Warming\nResearch Questions Value of Cutting Black Carbon as a Global Warming Solution\nTibetan Nomads Struggle as Grasslands Disappear from the Roof of the World\nArctic Nations Order Investigation of Black Carbon, Blamed for Significant Ice Melt\nThe Shipping Industry’s Pollution Problem Part II: A Lack of Authority\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
