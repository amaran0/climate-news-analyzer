  "content": "You’ll forgive Jason Box for being a little impatient these days. After all, you would be too if  you were in his position. As a geologist specializing in Greenland’s  glaciers and climate at Ohio State’s Byrd Polar Research Center,  in the summer of 2009 Box placed high resolution, wide-angle time-lapse  cameras along the Petermann Glacier in northwestern Greenland, near  where it flows into the sea.\nThere’s just one problem — he hasn’t been able to go back to retrieve the images.\nSo far the world has only seen NASA satellite images of the ice shelf breakup, which, interesting as they may be, are  difficult to put into context. On-the-ground imagery of such an ice loss  event could help drive home the reality of how quickly climate change  is reshaping the Arctic, and what it means for the rest of the world  given the ice’s role in raising global sea levels.\nUnfortunately for Box, who served as the lead author of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) “2010 Arctic Report Card,” he  was unable to obtain the funding and logistical support last year —  such as a ship and a helicopter — needed to retrieve the hourly images,  and add more equipment in an effort to document the glacier’s movement.\n“It’s likely [the cameras] operated,” Box says, “and if they did, some  very wide angle, high res. photos” were obtained, pointed right at the  area where the ice broke free from the glacier.\n“It was pretty difficult to turn our backs on it this year,” he says,  noting that, thanks to new support from the National Science Foundation  and a donor in the U.K., he plans to return to Petermann with his  colleagues by the spring of 2011.\n“We just need to put the logistics into place.”\nGrowing Concern About Fate of Marine-Terminating Glaciers\nThe Petermann Glacier isn’t just a photogenic location, it’s also a  central focus of research as scientists try to ascertain how quickly and  extensively Greenland’s ice cover is melting due at least in part to  global climate change. Their focus is increasingly turning to  Greenland’s northern glaciers, which are showing the greatest mass loss  and are dominating the losses of ice area, Box says.\nScientists are using satellites such as NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate (GRACE) satellite and field studies to keep tabs on glacial ice. They are  observing differences in melting trends between so-called “ice shelf  glaciers,” which have a floating area of ice known as an “ice tongue”  that is present year-round, and glaciers that develop seasonal ice  tongues.\nBox says ice shelf glaciers, such as Petermann, are showing a greater  sensitivity to the warming climate, but that large amounts of ice were  lost throughout Greenland during the 2010 melt season.\n“There is a signal of ice shelf loss within these warm years that  suggests that the ice shelf loss at Petermann and some of these other  large glaciers is with some confidence triggered by these warm summers,”  he says.\nAs is explained in the Arctic Report Card, which was released last  month, scientists are especially concerned about marine-terminating  glaciers such as Petermann, because they serve as the outlets for large  amounts of ice from the land into the sea.\nBox says a large calving event, such as what occurred with the  Petermann Glacier, can speed up a glacier’s slide towards the sea:\nIt is of concern because there is no expected or known mechanism to  reverse the accelerated loss. It’s like removing a cork from a bottle.  It will take an extended cold period to grow back the glacier ice on the  front of a glacier like Petermann.\n“The big question I think everyone wants to know,” Box says, is whether  global warming is driving the ice loss such as the calving event seen  last summer.\n“[The] Balance of evidence is strongly suggesting” a relationship to  warming temperatures, Box says, but exactly how such warming is driving  ice loss is unclear. He notes two warming-related processes that are  probably playing a role: surface melt and “hydrofracture,” a process by  which water fills crevices in the ice and forces them apart.\nWarmest Summer in Greenland Since Records Began in 1873\nAccording to the report card, last summer was Greenland’s warmest since  instrumental records began. Collectively, marine-terminating glaciers  lost an area of 419 square kilometers, which is 3.4 times the loss rate  seen during each of the previous eight years.\n“There is now clear evidence that the ice area loss rate of the past  decade is greater than loss rates pre-2000,” the report card states. The  report also notes an expansion of the area and duration of Greenland  ice melt during 2010, compared to past years.\nAs Box puts it, “What happened in Greenland really was exceptional in the observational record.”\nImage: Ohio State University/Jason Box\nRepublished by permission\nSee Also:\nNASA: May’s Melting of Arctic Ice Close to Speed of July\nGreenlanders Eager to Be New Deepwater Oil Frontier\nGreenpeace Expedition Documents Disappearing Greenland Glacier\nGreenland Melting: Ice Cube 109 Miles Long, Wide and Deep in One Year Alone\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
