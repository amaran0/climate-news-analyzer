  "title": "China Readies $1 Billion to Fight Worst Wheat Drought in 60 Years",
  "date": "2011-02-13T09:53:13-05:00",
  "content": "China has announced a billion dollars in emergency water aid to ease its most severe drought in 60 years, as the United Nations warned of a threat to the harvest of the world’s biggest wheat producer.\nBeijing has also promised to use its grain reserves to reduce the pressure on global food prices, which have surged in the past year to record highs due to the floods in Australia and a protracted dry spell in Russia.\nThe  desperate measures were evident at Baita reservoir in Shandong — one of  several key agricultural provinces afflicted by four months without  rain. With nearby crops turning yellow, a mechanical digger cut a crude,  open-cast well into the dried-up bed of the reservoir. Muddy water from  the 16-foot-deep pit was pumped up to the surface via a hose that  snaked past a fishing boat stranded on the cracked earth.\nAs the  water spluttered on to his wheat field, farmer Liu Baojin expressed  concern the support may have come too late. Despite the emergency well  digging and partial compensation from the government, he fears he may  have to seek work in the city if his harvest fails.\n“I guess a third of my crops have already died,” he said. “I’m very worried. I’ve never seen such a dry spell.”\nThe  problems are compounded by the growing water demands of cities and  industry. On the outskirts of Sishui — which translates as Four Waters  due to its historic abundance of rivers and sprints — villagers complain  that they are not allowed to use the Si river that runs past their  homes because the water is earmarked for the Huajin paper mill and an  artificial lake in a nearby urban development.\n“We can’t use our  own water. The local officials want to keep it so they can show a ‘green  face’ to the big-shot leaders from Beijing,” said a peanut and cotton  farmer who gave the surname Liu. “We are very angry. But we are afraid  to complain.”\nLocal newspapers have been filled with stories of  the drought’s impact on the “wheat basket” provinces of Henan, Anhui and  Hunan. About 2.6 million people and 2.8 million livestock are affected.  To induce precipitation, the army and meteorological officials have  fired cloud-seeding chemicals into the sky.\nA light overnight fall  of snow raised hopes that the drought may be about to break, but the  Shandong Climate Centre said it stopped at 0.4 centimeters — only enough to dust  the fields.\n“It’s too little to make any difference,” said Kong  Dekun, who farms land near the mythical birthplace of Confucius in  Fuzidong. “We should have had at least two big snowfalls by now.”\nThe UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization issued an alert on February 8.  “The ongoing drought is potentially a very serious problem,” it said,  noting that the affected area of 12.75 million acres represented two-thirds of China’s wheat production.\nThis has added to upward pressure on global wheat prices, which surged 76 percent last year due to a combination of speculation, rising demand and climatic impacts on production in Canada, Australia, Europe and Russia.\nChina  bucked the trend with a record harvest in 2010, but the lack of rain —  even by the standards of the dry season — has prompted concerns and  price speculation that have pushed domestic wheat prices to record  highs.\n“This drought is unusual,” said Kisan Gunjal, food  emergency officer at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. “There is  not such a great problem now as the crop is dormant, but we must keep  in mind that if it remains dry or if temperatures in February go below  the frost kill level – then this could be a significant event.”\nRising food prices are said to have contributed to the unrest in Egypt and Tunisia. The Chinese government is trying to head off a destabilizing level of stress over water, which is arguably the country’s biggest environmental problem.\nPremier Wen Jiabao has visited Shandong to promise help for the farmers. Last week, his government unveiled a 6.7bn yuan ($1bn) package of measures to divert water, construct emergency wells and improve irrigation.\nLast  month, it announced a doubling of spending on water conservation to 4 trillion  yuan ($606.82 billion) over the next ten years, along with a first annual cap on  water at 670 billion cubic meters. Huge sums are also being spent on  water diversion projects, well digging and desalination plants.\nImage: Steve Evans\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read.
