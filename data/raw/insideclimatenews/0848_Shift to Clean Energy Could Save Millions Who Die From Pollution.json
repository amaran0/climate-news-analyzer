  "title": "Shift to Clean Energy Could Save Millions Who Die From Pollution",

  "content": "Extra investments to control deadly pollutants like smog and soot could cut worldwide deaths from air pollution in half in a few decades and end the growth of global warming emissions in just a few years, international experts declared on Monday.\nIn its first report ever to examine the links between these twin goals, the authoritative International Energy Agency said the solutions go “hand-in-hand.”\nWith a 7 percent increase in energy-related investment, it said, the world could cut air-pollution mortality from about 6.5 million today to 3.3 million in 2040. And the changes would bring about a peak in CO2 emissions by 2020, it said.\nAlong with spending on pollution control equipment, the keys, it said, are energy efficiency and the use of renewables like wind and solar.\nThe report marks a new movement among those who favor the long-term goal of fighting global warming toward an equal and more immediate concern—protecting the health of the world.\n“Clean air is a basic human right that most of the world’s population lacks,” said Fatih Birol, IEA’s executive director in a statement. “No country—rich or poor—can claim that the task of tackling air pollution is complete.”\nThe effects of air pollution are greatest in developing countries in Asia where there is a high reliance on coal for power generation and in sub-Saharan Africa, where inefficient burning of biomass accounts for more than half of its air pollution.\nEighty percent of the global population living in cities that monitor pollution levels are breathing air considered unhealthy by the World Health Organization.\nMore than half of all Americans still breathe polluted air due to high ozone and particulate matter, according to a report published earlier this year by the American Lung Association.\nThe life expectancy of people living in London is cut short by approximately 16 months due to elevated levels of nitrogen oxide, according to a report published in December by the London-based think tank Policy Exchange.\nThe IEA assessment outlines a Clean Air Scenario where an additional $4.8 trillion in pollution control technologies, renewable energy and energy efficiency measures is invested worldwide between now and 2040. The investment would include making clean cooking facilities available to an additional 1.8 billion people worldwide.\nThe $4.8 trillion cost represents an additional 7 percent on top of energy spending plans already announced by the world’s nations, including the pledges to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that they made under the new Paris climate treaty.  (The IEA calls this baseline its “New Policies Scenario” to distinguish it from business as usual.)\nThe alternative Clean Air Scenario detailed in the report would result in a drop of more than 50 percent in global emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and a nearly 75 percent reduction in harmful particulate matter emissions by 2040.\nAir pollution reductions would be greatest in developing countries. The 60 percent of India’s population currently exposed to air with a high concentration of fine particles would, for example, fall to less than 20 percent, according to the report.\n“Implementing the IEA strategy in the Clean Air Scenario can push energy-related pollution levels into a steep decline in all countries,” Birol said.\n“It can also deliver universal access to modern energy, a rapid peak and decline in global greenhouse-gas emissions and lower fossil-fuel import bills in many countries.”\nThe Clean Air Scenario would result in a peak of global carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector by 2020. Pledges made in Paris, by contrast, would allow CO2 emissions to increase until at least 2040. Additional investments and policies beyond the IEA’s Clean Air Scenario would be required to limit warming to the global goal of no more than 2 degrees Celsius.\nCarbon dioxide emissions in China may have already peaked in part because the country has made it a priority to reduce air pollution, which results in the premature death of thousands of people in the country each day.\nA desire to reduce air pollution in India, which along with China accounts for more than half of all air pollution related deaths worldwide, could drive similar emissions reductions.\n“It is clear that India needs an aggressive shift to clean energy now,” Sunil Dahiya, climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace India, said in a statement. “This is the only way to keep our air quality within breathable limits.”\nPerhaps you noticed: This story, like all the news we publish, is free to read. That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization. We do not charge a subscription fee, lock our news behind a paywall, or clutter our website with ads. We make our news on climate and the environment freely available to you and anyone who wants it.\nThat’s not all. We also share our news for free with scores of other media organizations around the country. Many of them can’t afford to do environmental journalism of their own. We’ve built bureaus from coast to coast to report local stories, collaborate with local newsrooms and co-publish articles so that this vital work is shared as widely as possible.\nTwo of us launched ICN in 2007. Six years later we earned a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and now we run the oldest and largest dedicated climate newsroom in the nation. We tell the story in all its complexity. We hold polluters accountable. We expose environmental injustice. We debunk misinformation. We scrutinize solutions and inspire action.\nDonations from readers like you fund every aspect of what we do.
