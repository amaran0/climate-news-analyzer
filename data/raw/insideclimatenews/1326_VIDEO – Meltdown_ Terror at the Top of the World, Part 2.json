  "content": "More than a year ago, InsideClimate News reporter Sabrina Shankman set out to tell the story of seven American hikers who went on a wilderness adventure into Canada’s Arctic tundra—polar bear country—and came back with a harrowing story.\nThe result was “Meltdown: Terror at the Top of the World,” an e-book we released last month that shows what is happening right now to polar bears and people as climate change melts the Arctic.\nBelow is Part 2 of the documentary video “Polar Bear Man” produced by VICE, ICN’s partner in this project.  Watch Part 1.\nRead a free excerpt of Meltdown here.

That’s because Inside Climate News is a 501c3 nonprofit organization. We do not charge a subscription fee, lock our news behind a paywall, or clutter our website with ads. We make our news on climate and the environment freely available to you and anyone who wants it.\nThat’s not all. We also share our news for free with scores of other media organizations around the country. Many of them can’t afford to do environmental journalism of their own. We’ve built bureaus from coast to coast to report local stories, collaborate with local newsrooms and co-publish articles so that this vital work is shared as widely as possible.\nTwo of us launched ICN in 2007. Six years later we earned a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and now we run the oldest and largest dedicated climate newsroom in the nation. We tell the story in all its complexity. We hold polluters accountable. We expose environmental injustice. We debunk misinformation. We scrutinize solutions and inspire action.\nDonations from readers like you fund every aspect of what we do. If you don’t already, will you support our ongoing work, our reporting on the biggest crisis facing our planet, and help us reach even more readers in more places?\nPlease take a moment to make a tax-deductible donation. Every one of them makes a difference.\nThank you,\nDavid Sassoon\n\t\t\tFounder and Publisher\nVernon Loeb\n\t\t\tExecutive Editor\nWe deliver climate news to your inbox like nobody else. Every day or once a week, our original stories and digest of the web's top headlines deliver the full story, for free.\nThe state’s vast farmlands sit atop an underground basin of rock that is ideal for some carbon dioxide storage, but legislators want to protect a valuable aquifer that provides water to hundreds of thousands of people.\nBy Susan Cosier\nICN provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going.",
